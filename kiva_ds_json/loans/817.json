She is married to Ordialyn, a jeepney driver, and a mother to their two children. By the grace of God, Avelina has managed to support her child's schooling. Her two children have already settled down with their own families. She is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAvelina oversees operations of their jeepney* transportation business. They have one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which are paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loans. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and spare parts of their jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAvelina hopes to have another vehicle some day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*Curiously, Jeepney has purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw out the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepney is one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n**All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1049514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

Most people who live here work as merchants or farmers, or they raise animals.  These individuals have been with their communal bank for 3 loan cycles, and they are very pleased with the help that they have been getting from the institution.\r\n\r\nIn this place we meet Rosa, who is 50 years old.  Her husband died a number of years ago and left her alone with their 6 children.  Now 4 of these children are adults, while the other two, aged 13 and 15, are in school.  Three of her children still live with her.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a living, and to meet the needs of her children, Rosa has worked for many years in her parish church, doing chores such as cleaning and other activities.  But, as this did not generate enough income to cover her household expenses and the expenses of raising her children, a friend motivated her to start to sell clothing.

When developing this solution, he focused his attention on creating an all-purpose wash that could be used for all vehicles and had the environment in mind.

is Cecilla, 63, resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite City, Philippines. Her husband is Leandro, her business partner. She together with her husband manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCecilla operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCecilla dreams to grow her business and secure her future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1049845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"  To pay for

age 51, operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. She also prepares and sells cooked viands for an additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.  \r\n   \r\nPasencia lives with her husband Ferdinand in Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite. Ferdinand works as a driver. They have four children and they manage their household while operating their respective businesses. Patencia is working hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php15, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nPasencia hopes to see her business grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work in her business.

is Lina, 59, a resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite, Philippines. She is married and mother of five children. She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLina operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from round palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLina hopes to increase production and dreams of being able to give all her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1049885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":" To pay for raw

is Emma, 34, a resident of Baseco, Manila, Philippines. She is married to Alex, her business partner, and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmma operates a business where she sells watches and cell phones. She buys them at wholesale prices and sells them for a small profit. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices. Aside from her retail business she also earns an income through her tap water refilling station. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 3,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEmma dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1049942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy watches and cell phones for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-23T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-22T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":9333,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":9444.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998106,"comment":null},{"amount":220,"local_amount":9334,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":9445.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606646,"comment":null},{"amount":220,"local_amount":9332.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":9444.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095503,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":7000.04,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7083.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359114,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T00:01:11Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406945,"name":"Ngon\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Ngon\u00e9 habite dans une des localit\u00e9s du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

is Magdalena, sixty-two, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Pacifico, her business partner, and is the mother of three children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMagdalena operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMagdalena dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

The city itself has a hot climate all year round. Danilo is very enthusiastic. In his free time, he likes to ride motorcycles and walk around the city to entertain himself. Like any good Peruvian, Danilo likes typical Peruvian foods. His favorite dish is the delicious  \u201cLocro con Carne\u201d, a  Peruvian meat stew.

has been a farmer in Nkubu area of Central Kenya for twelve years and currently supplies his produce of maize, beans and bananas to the local market.

As a result, when he was ten, he joined his dad, in the bread baking business. When he got married, he established his own bakery.

is Patricia, 52, who is a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Ricardo, a mason, and she is a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nPatricia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPatricia hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1049975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"  To pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-24T00:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-23T00:00:07Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6797.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998108,"comment":null},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5332.97,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5437.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606648,"comment":null},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5333.03,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095505,"comment":null},{"amount":63.33,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2719.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359116,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T02:08:14Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406227,"name":"Mwarabu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwarabu is a 43-year-old married woman.

is 26 year-old Fatmata.  She is married and has one four year old child.  She has no additional dependents which live with her.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fatmata established her plastic, rubber and glass plate business. She began her business after she completed her diploma in business management and even though she tried hard to find a job she could not. She then decided to establish her own business.  With the experience she has and the qualification, she concluded that she can grow faster so she requested some amount of money from her husband to start her business. \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and ten hours a day, she earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

Carla's first business was raising and selling pigs, an activity that she was involved in for 3 years because her parents were owners of a farm, and she always cared for and fed the animals.  After her marriage she became a housewife, and now she sells milk, dairy products and soft drinks.  Her husband helps her with the business, because in order to buy, sell or deliver the milk she has to transport it by motorcycle.  Some of her customers come to the neighborhood where she lives in the city of Leon.  Carla relies on the income her husband earns as a welder and bricklayer.  Her greatest hope is to someday set up a grocery store in her house, because there are few in her neighborhood, and her milk business is only in the morning, which means that in the afternoons she would have the free time to tend to a grocery store.

She is married to Tyron, a messenger, and a mother to her child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nMary Jane operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Jane hopes to expand soon, she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMelinda hopes to have another store in their community, she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

When he started out, he did it with money lent at a high cost, little merchandise, and buying things with high turnover that sold quickly because he had to pay quickly. Almost all of his earnings wound up in other people\u2019s hands. His wife has been his greatest strength. Without her he couldn\u2019t have gotten his work done, because she has helped him in his work, while he simultaneously also works in bricklaying and motorcycle mechanics, among other things that he has learned and which have generated income that have been important for growth. He is now requesting a Kiva loan, his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he will use to buy grocery items that will diversify his inventory and will guarantee a permanent inventory for responding to his customers\u2019 requests; they often leave dissatisfied because Jader doesn\u2019t have things in his store and this is a big challenge, as is not having sufficient capital.

is Emelia, 54, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is married. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nEmelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHPs worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmelia hopes to grow her business in the coming years.

She usually raises the pig for seven to eight months before selling it. The selling price is around 3,500,000 IDR per pig, depending on the weight. The income from the business enables her to support the needs of her family as her husband\u2019s income as a mason is insufficient to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nHarlince has four pigs to raise and one of them is ready to be sold. She desires to purchase more piglets to raise, so she applied for a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 5,000,000. She hopes that the loan will help her to be success in the business.

He started his business 4 years ago helping his aunt with a store she owned. When his aunt fell gravely ill, she rented it to him and today he generates income that he pays his aunt with. He makes enough to support himself and to acquire his own equipment. Every day the business belongs to him more and he wants to be able to have enough infrastructure to be able to be totally independent. Breiner sells food, groceries and basic family basket items as well as beverages. Right now he doesn't have enough working capital to meet his goal of growing and paying for things upfront which will bring optimal prices for the items he sells. That is why he turned to a Kiva loan, the first loan he has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will buy rice, sugar, oil, beverages and other groceries to have a better selection and keep getting new customers, which will finally make his business sustainable.

They offer many diverse items in their shop, like oil, rice, flour, sugar, coffee, drinks, vegetables, and meat. \r\n\r\nRight now they are planning their store's expansion, including having miscellaneous items in their display, like accessories, home goods, paper items, etc, but their business capital is insufficient for large-scale purchase to get important discounts. \r\n\r\nThis is why they are getting a Kiva loan, the first loan they have done with the Maria Santo Domingo Foundation, through which they will purchase varied merchandise, shoes, cosmetics, soaps, accessories for the home and paper goods, since their goal is to be able to have their own store location, which would be well-located to sell miscellaneous products especially and have new opportunities for income, which would benefit the development and wellbeing of their family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1045847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy varied merchandise, shoes, cosmetics, soaps, feminine accents for the home, and paper goods.

She gained her first business experience many years ago, selling merchandise through specialized product directories or catalogs.  She mainly sold cosmetics and perfume but gradually added clothing and other products and distributed her merchandise to her gradually growing clientele. Once she was positioned with her customers and identified by her neighbors, she decided to organize a point of sale in her own home and her business began to grow even more.  \r\n\r\nToday, she has a building stocked with a variety of merchandise, and a clientele that increases demand for her products.
