Mar\u00eda Isabel is thankful for the help that the Kiva investors have offered to people from scarce backgrounds and poor countries like Nicaragua, so that they can have a dignified means of work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200.93,"image":{"id":1135234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to invest in working capital and to supply her business in buying and selling clothing with items like blouses, shirts, skirts, pants, sandals, bedding, dresses, pajamas, and children's clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-05-02T12:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-01T12:20:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":583.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.07,"local_amount":584.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":621.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373163075,"comment":null},{"amount":25.18,"local_amount":587.57,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":623.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381968846,"comment":null},{"amount":25.53,"local_amount":595.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":632.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390830649,"comment":null},{"amount":26.66,"local_amount":622.15,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":660.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399855445,"comment":null},{"amount":26.72,"local_amount":623.57,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":662.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410130751,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":485.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":516,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419896410,"comment":null},{"amount":25.3,"local_amount":590.41,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":626.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545720,"comment":null},{"amount":25.63,"local_amount":598.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":635.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199495,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-02T21:00:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554589,"name":"Massa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Massa is 33 years old and lives in Kakata, the capital city of Margibi County, which has the highest production of rubber plantation in Liberia.

is from Kapan town where she lives with her husband (in the photo) and son. Satenik works at a local school as a teacher. As she had no opportunity to get higher education when she was young, now she works as a teacher without an educational background. Satenik applied to university last year. Now she is in the second course, studying primary education pedagogy. The salary she earns from teaching at school is barely enough to make ends meet. It is very difficult for her to cover her family\u2019s costs and save money for her education. Satenik has applied for this loan to pay for her university tuition. The loan is very important for Satenik to make her dream come true and have a higher education degree.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1342308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"pay for her university tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan, Syunik region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-05-02T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-01T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Satenik","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":9999.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10088.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10296.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10252.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10689.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10759.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10851.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":11106.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":11220.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":11392},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":11600.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":11742.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":10005.7,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373026173,"comment":null},{"amount":25.22,"local_amount":10090.3,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10377.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381815548,"comment":null},{"amount":25.74,"local_amount":10289.4,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10582.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390674337,"comment":null},{"amount":25.63,"local_amount":10255.5,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10547.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399920030,"comment":null},{"amount":26.73,"local_amount":10692.9,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":10997.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410203011,"comment":null},{"amount":58.69,"local_amount":23477.8,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":24145.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420157260,"comment":null},{"amount":121.94,"local_amount":48776.8,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50164.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308339,"comment":null},{"amount":16.05,"local_amount":6411.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6593.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845618,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-02T13:43:17Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:26:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554606,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is 54 years old, married to Harrison, and a mother of six.

is 60 years old. He lives in the small village of Senaki District with his wife. Givi has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows, two calves and three pigs. Besides these animals, they have a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested products locally. It is hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGivi has requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Givi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

By age 17, he began a small business where he trained others in his community to use computers and designed websites for businesses. After graduating from the University of Georgia with a major in political science, Glenn worked as a project manager for an analytic solutions company for several years. During this time he began crafting the idea for his own business.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Glenn began JLAX\u2014Go Local Display, a digital ad network business. Using his savings, Glenn purchased several 23-inch flat screen monitors and small computers to initially launch his business idea. Glenn installs screens in local businesses and throughout town and then rents out advertisement time to companies. Businesses pay Glenn according to the number of advertisements he runs for them each day.

Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. The Government have provided a house to her under Indira Awash Yojana (Housing Scheme).\r\n\r\n Belmati has been running a spice items vending business with items like chilly, cumin seeds, coriander, turmeric, garlic, etc. for the last 10 years. Her husband goes to six weekly markets of her locality every week with bulk of items on a moped and sells in the market.  Her monthly income from the existing business is Rs.3000. Out of this income she can hardly manage her household expenses. She wants to increase the stock of her business, so the loan amount will be utilized to purchase items like chilly, coriander, cumin seed, etc.in bulk to keep the business stocked for a month. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently from the nearest market and she can add a substantial income to her present income.\r\n\r\n Belmati hopes to purchase a bike to run her business smoothly with sufficient items and to build a house. The other three members of the group are Deimati, Bela and Rekha who are running a general grocery shop and vegetable vending businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1342458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Only the 18-year-old is still a student and dependent on her. She was born in Sauce, located in northern Nicaragua. In her free time, she likes to have fun with her family and cook a regional chicken stew. Sadly, she lacked the resources to go to college; therefore, she strives each day to offer her son a brighter future and professional training. \r\n\r\nShe wants to succeed and has been selling cosmetics and wood both as a street vendor and from her home. Previously, she made and sold tortillas. Her doctor advised her to give up this activity because she suffers rheumatism, and making tortillas required that she heat and wet her hands. She now works eight hours each day.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan as working capital to stock her business. Mar\u00eda Susana thanks Kiva lenders for offering low-income people in countries like Nicaragua a chance for decent work.

Gerelsuren, 27 years old, lives with her husband and seven-year-old child in Darkhan, the second largest city of Mongolia. Since 2010, she has been working at the train station. Her husband has been working for National Emergency Agency of Mongolia for six consecutive years. Their son goes to secondary school. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Using her previous loan, she has purchased furniture and made her house a comfortable living place. Now she is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, bricks, cements and metals. Using these materials, she wants to make an extension to her house and build a garage for her automobile. The house extension will stop the heat loss through the door and building a garage will protect their automobile from harsh winter storms. The automobile, which is frozen for long perciods during winter nights, tends to waste more fuel and release more carbon dioxide and chemicals harmful to clean air. So, making an extension and building a garage is essential for reducing fuel usage, emitting less smoke and then contributing to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for better future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":208.42,"image":{"id":1342688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Unfortunately, she was not able to go to college, but she would have liked to study business administration.\r\n\r\nThanks to her effort and her desire to succeed, she has a business selling pi\u00f1atas and children's party supplies such as plates, glasses, disposable silverware, candles, confetti, balloons, thermoses with straws, plastic chairs and tables. She dedicates about 10 hours per day to her business, which is located in a market in her town.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to invest in working capital and stock her business by buying children's party supplies, so that in the not-so-distant future she can obtain a better income.

She is married to Sulpicio, a seaman, and she is a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElizabeth runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Elizabeth's case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan to buy more used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from a \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, used bags and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of her capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nElizabeth dreams that she will have a better living and hopes that her business will continue to be successful. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1342691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To pay for additional stock of used-but-quality clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-05-02T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-01T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2748.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894880,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2132.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2198.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381669919,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2748.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534452,"comment":null},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":549.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399783850,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-02T20:10:59Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:52:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554812,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 44 years old and married with four children.

loves. Her daughter is her main purpose in life. She is a very kind, hardworking, and enthusiastic person, and she dedicates all her effort to providing for her little one because Rocio is both mother and father to her. Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and because she had to start working when she was very young, Rocio wasn't able to study nursing, but she would have liked doing so. In her spare time she likes to watch television and she occasionally makes a delicious ceviche to share with her family.\r\n\r\nThanks to her mother's support and her own perseverance and dedication, Rocio works selling sweets and drinks. Her small business is set up in a small space in her home and she can work approximately twelve hours. Rocio feels comfortable working and believes the reason why business is going well for her is because of her good prices and the kind service she offers her customers. \r\n\r\nRocio is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because the help they offer will allow her to purchase a freezer, which will be of great help for her to keep the drinks she sells in better condition, as well as the food products. This way Rocio will be able to sell ice cold drinks and will have more customers, so she will keep working and doing her best to achieve her dream of having her own home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475.97,"image":{"id":1339455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to purchase a freezer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-02T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-01T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":128.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":138.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":146.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":155.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":163.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":168.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":176.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":181.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":188.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":197.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":203.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.95,"local_amount":128.9,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":130.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889529,"comment":null},{"amount":53.84,"local_amount":138.95,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":140.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664424,"comment":null},{"amount":56.79,"local_amount":146.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":148.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775880,"comment":null},{"amount":58.15,"local_amount":150.05,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":151.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779140,"comment":null},{"amount":60.4,"local_amount":155.88,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":157.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054323,"comment":null},{"amount":63.39,"local_amount":163.58,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":165.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819240,"comment":null},{"amount":65.22,"local_amount":168.31,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":170.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472201,"comment":null},{"amount":68.23,"local_amount":176.07,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":178,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694710,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-03T05:21:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554839,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda previously received a loan for 25,000 PHP to buy items to sell to her customers.

Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.  They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\nDolores previously received a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to buy spare parts and accessories and to maintain her jeepney. The earnings from her loan were a big help in her personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nDolores is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and maintain her jeepney. She will use the profits from her loan to help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. In the future, Dolores dreams of having another jeepney. She meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Javier will continue working to achieve his greatest dream of having a transportation company.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":828.92,"image":{"id":1339483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to buy a computer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T05:00:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Javier Helemher ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":232.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":245.61},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":251.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":264.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":271.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":282.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":296.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":305.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":319.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":330.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":343.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":358.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":184.29,"local_amount":477.78,"processed_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":480.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889533,"comment":null},{"amount":96.85,"local_amount":251.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":252.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664426,"comment":null},{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":264.69,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":266.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775887,"comment":null},{"amount":104.76,"local_amount":271.59,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":273.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779143,"comment":null},{"amount":108.92,"local_amount":282.38,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:17:33Z","rounded_local_amount":284.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054326,"comment":null},{"amount":114.23,"local_amount":296.14,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":298.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472204,"comment":null},{"amount":117.78,"local_amount":305.36,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694713,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T07:13:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554871,"name":"Salem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salem is a married Iraqi client who is 57 years old.

She is married and the mother of three children. Manzura is a teacher by profession. Since her childhood she dreamt of becoming a teacher and worked hard towards this. Her dream came true and currently she works as a teacher at a rural school. Manzura loves her work very much and she loves her pupils like her children. \r\n\r\nHer husband is in Russia as a migrant worker, and every month, when it is possible, he sends financial support to his family. Before her husband traveled to the Russian federation he worked with livestock breeding. Currently Manzura continues this business herself. Her paid salary is not sufficient and therefore she tries to develop the livestock business. When her husband left, he taught her this activity, and she easily handles the business. Her eldest son helps her with this. At home they have several heads of livestock. They live in a rural area and have a plot of land where the livestock can graze. \r\n\r\nManzura turned to the organization Arvand for a loan, in order to increase the number of livestock. She plans to purchase one bull calf for the loan, and hopes for help and support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1337618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a bull","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manzura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":237.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":245.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":254.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":262.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":237.64,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":254.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971495,"comment":null},{"amount":171.53,"local_amount":762.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":816.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752019,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-03T05:33:56Z","paid_date":"2013-07-19T09:03:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554872,"name":"Kirinkai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kirinkai is a 51-year-old man.

is 51 years old. She lives in the small village of the Khelvachauri district with her son. \r\n\r\nEter has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have 0.3 hectare plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the harvested products locally.  It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEter requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Eter has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit, Eter will renovate a two-room flat for renting. After the flat is renovated, Eter will rent it out and increase the income of her family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is a friendly and kind woman. She\u2019s from Lebanon and is 54 years old. She\u2019s divorced and living with her only parent and siblings. Ghada and her youngest brother are working really hard to provide the family with the needed income. Since she noticed that their income does not satisfy their needs, she decided to start her own business.

For this purpose, Zohra has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan, for the growth of her husband's general store. He would purchase items such as bread, eggs, detergent, tea, coffee, washing powder etc for his general store .This will help in increasing their monthly savings and improving their children's future as well.

She and her husband have been farming their land for seven years and are currently growing a good variety of crops, including maize, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other vegetables. \r\n\r\nWhen asked if she was excited about starting to keep bees, Linet said that she was and that beekeeping is \"easy to manage\" and a \"good project.\" Linet plans to use the income generated from her hives to feed her family and to buy farming equipment, like jembes (hoes) and pangas (machetes). \r\n\r\nLinet's hope for the future is \"for me and my family to have a good life; that is, for my kids to have good jobs, enough food, and a good house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1342989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy beehives for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.283333 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":839,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726162,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-03T18:11:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555002,"name":"Anass","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anass is 20 years old, a single man who lives in Taiz, Yemen.

With this, Javier will be able to serve more customers, and so he will continue working and making an effort to achieve his greatest dream of owning his own home.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":416.93,"image":{"id":1340601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

lives outside of Kakamega town, in Kakamega county. Kakamega county is located in Western Kenya and is famous for having the only tropical rain forest in the country. Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping. \r\n\r\nOscar is married, and has three children. His wife currently works as a teacher, while he farms their land. He has been farming for five years, and is currently growing sugar cane and vegetables. Oscar is excited to work with Honey Care Africa, because he enjoys the free training sessions and the chance to learn about beekeeping. He also likes beekeeping, because it is a long term project and is not time-consuming. \r\n\r\nThis is Oscar's first loan, and he plans to use the income from his beehives to pay school fees for his children and renovate his house.

She is a widow and a saleswoman. She is 48 years old and and has three children. \r\n\r\nHer business consists of making and selling enchiladas and tacos in the market. She has had the business for two and a half years. It has been her means of support, since she lost the income of her husband when he died, and she had to move forward. Thanks to her business she has brought her family forward, together with her daughter.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Carolina is a homemaker, an honorable and hard-working person who knows the value of being independent. Her work day starts when she gets up at three in the morning to make enchiladas and tacos, together with her oldest daughter who helps her. They have to be ready at eight in the morning, which is when she leaves her workplace to begin selling. Later, when she finishes her day at the market, Mrs. Carolina returns home to care for her younger children. She started the business with her own money. Her sales are in cash, and her clients are the people who pass by in the market. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she needs to repair her kitchen. The infrastructure has deteriorated as time passed. For this reason, she needs the loan to buy construction materials to repair her kitchen, which is her means of work because it is where she makes the daily food for her family as well as the tacos and enchiladas for her business.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy sand, stone, white cement, and labor.

lives outside of Kakamega town, in Kakamega county. Kakamega county is located in Western Kenya and is famous for having the only tropical rain forest in the country. Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping. <p>\r\n\r\nAnne is married, and has three children. Both she and her husband have been farming for more than 20 years. Anne is currently tending dairy cows, raising poultry and growing vegetables on her land. She is excited to start beekeeping for two main reasons: the bees do all of the work, and she loves eating honey. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is Anne's first loan, and she plans to use the income generated by her beehives to buy even more hives.

This will allow her to satisfy her household needs.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Nubia wants to have her own store and support her two children obtain a higher education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1341325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothing and beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"La Ceja","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Nubia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71441},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73411},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75434},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77514},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79651},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81847},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":84103},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86422},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88804},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91252},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93768},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96353}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.38},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.66,"local_amount":72104,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":72670.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373514347,"comment":null},{"amount":40.84,"local_amount":74256,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":74839.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382164955,"comment":null},{"amount":469.5,"local_amount":853640,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":860350.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390981981,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T12:34:39Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:47:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554117,"name":"Ana Sagrario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana, tiene 54 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su esposo, tiene 4 hijos y vive en el municipio de Choloma, Cortes junto a su esposo y una nieta.

The group is comprised of seven members and is governed by a Board of Directors and Isidora, their President.  The members of the communal association work in a variety of businesses including: alpaca wool spinning, selling sports jackets, selling knapsacks, sewing jackets, weaving textiles, selling meat-filled pastries, and weaving blankets. \r\n\r\nThe loan they take out will benefit these small-business owners including Isidora.
