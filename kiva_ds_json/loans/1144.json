Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops.  She has 6 children and has been doing this work for 5 years. \r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'horticulture!' Her biggest challenge is 'drought.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'null.'\r\n\r\nSusan was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'because it deals with smallholder farmers.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'record keeping.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Susan replied 'will assist in the payment of school fees.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Susan owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

He lives in a small village Mereti, Gori district with his wife, retired parents and two children (1 and 6 years old). Guram requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family start up business, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities.  In particular, they have a plot of land, where plum and apple trees are grown. Harvested products are sold at the local markets. Family has an additional income from Guram\u2019s parent\u2019s monthly pension.  The family's total monthly income is 425 Gel. This amount is barely enough to feed 6 members family.<p>\r\n\r\nGuram requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program involves providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. <p>\r\n\r\nWith his credit Guram will purchase a milk cow. The cow will be milked every day to produce dairy products. Guram will sell the products at the local market and earn a profit. He is a very hard working man and in the future plans to reinvest the profit in development of the dairy farm by purchasing more milk cows and selling more dairy products. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will give the family an opportunity to cover the food expenses, purchase household items and help improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":287.5,"image":{"id":1367357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a milk cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Mereti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-14T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-14T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guram ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":119.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134090,"comment":null},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":119.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107678,"comment":null},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":119.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255218,"comment":null},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":119.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019354,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T07:52:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571183,"name":"Leonorica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of five children, Leonorica works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a general store in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from prepaid mobile load.

The group is made up of nine members and is governed by a board of directors. Ines is the President. The businesses run by the group's members are diverse, including stores selling chu\u00f1o (artisanal freeze-dried potato traditionally made in Peru) and mote (boiled corn), a neighborhood store, and sales of salchipapas (fried potatoes with hot dog), wool, clothing, sweaters, and tucumanas (a meat-filled pastry). This new loan will help small business owners in the group, of which Ines is a member.\r\n\r\nInes got involved with Pro Mujer a year ago through the invitation from a friend who was already a member. She currently owns her own business selling  crocheted goods and sweaters. Ines is married and has five children. She opened this business own her own. She already knew how to crochet, so she turned it into a business. \r\n\r\nThis loan will help Ines by increasing her capital so that she can buy wool from some distributors that she can later use to make goods to sell. This type of work allows her to keep up with her studies. Ines likes working with Pro Mujer because of the health services it offers.

As well as working on his own land with his crops he also helps other farmers to finish their crops, for which he receives payment.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is seeking from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 4 bags of fertilizer, along with other farming supplies, in order to cultivate 7,000 square meters of corn and 7,000 square meters of beans. By buying the supplies all at once he will obtain a better price and he will use them over a period of time. In addition, he will avoid having to leave town so often to get them. His objective is to provide an education for his children so that they become professionals and to build his own house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1369715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 4 bags of fertilizer, along with other farming supplies, in order to cultivate 7,000 square meters of corn and 7,000 square meters of beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T01:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T01:20:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":325,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-15T16:31:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571190,"name":"Merab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merab is 46 years old.

Merab has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Merab will purchase products to make more food in his caf\u00e9.

is 45 years old. He lives in Akhaltsikhe district with his 41-year-old wife, 23-year-old son and retired parents. Nikoloz requested loans from local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without success. His loan requests were rejected because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nNikoloz\u2019s father is working at the local petrol station and earns a small monthly income. Nikoloz\u2019s parents' monthly pension provides additional income.\r\nNikoloz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Nikoloz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Nikoloz will start trading fruits and vegetables. He used to work in this business before and is very experienced in this field. This will help him to start the new business and make it profitable.

Amiran requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Amiran has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Amiran will open a spare parts shop. He will be selling spare parts and tools for different jobs. Amiran will rent a commercial space at a populous area and purchase the products at the wholesale price to resell them at the higher price and earn a good profit.  Amiran is a very hard working man. He wants to expand the business and have a better income for the family so he can provide all the needed household goods and cover all the monthly expenses. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1368595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"To open a spare parts shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Daba Laiteri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amiran ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.28,"local_amount":105.86,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":108.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613733,"comment":null},{"amount":67.19,"local_amount":108.95,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":111.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857445,"comment":null},{"amount":69.14,"local_amount":112.13,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":114.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134094,"comment":null},{"amount":71.85,"local_amount":116.51,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":118.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107682,"comment":null},{"amount":73.27,"local_amount":118.81,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":121.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255222,"comment":null},{"amount":578.27,"local_amount":937.74,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":957,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019358,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-12T16:21:48Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571201,"name":"Malia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Malia is a 58-year-old woman who is married with six children.

Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMarine is a seller at the local shop and earns a small monthly income. Her husband, George, is diabetic and gets a monthly pension of 70 Lari from the local government institution. The family's total income is so small that it\u2019s rarely enough for food for them.\r\n\r\nMarine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Marine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Marine will purchase grocery stock to open a grocery shop. She has already rented a small shop at the local market. Marine is very experienced in this field as she has been a seller for many years, and her experience will help the business to be successful. Part of the profit she will be reinvesting in the same field and purchasing more varieties of groceries in order to provide better service for the customers. Another part will be used to cover the family's monthly expenses. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":289.25,"image":{"id":1368698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase grocery stock to open a grocery shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Rustavi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T05:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T05:00:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":79.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.93,"local_amount":73.49,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":76.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613736,"comment":null},{"amount":46.08,"local_amount":73.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":76.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857448,"comment":null},{"amount":47.26,"local_amount":75.62,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":78.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134097,"comment":null},{"amount":48.89,"local_amount":78.22,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":80.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107684,"comment":null},{"amount":49.74,"local_amount":79.59,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":82.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255224,"comment":null},{"amount":51.35,"local_amount":82.16,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":84.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019360,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T15:35:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572018,"name":"Ablaye","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Ablaye est un homme qui \u00e9volue dans le secteur de l'\u00e9levage des moutons.

She lives in Samtredia district with her husband George and son David. Valentina requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is George\u2019s monthly salary. He is a director at the local school. There is only one source of income in the family and this is not enough to cover the basic needs of the members.\r\n\r\nValentina requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Valentina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

He lives in Zestaponi district with his retired parents. Gocha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. Gocha earns a living from agricultural activities. He has three milk cows and owns a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where vegetables are grown. Gocha has worked in agriculture from a young age alongside his father and is very experienced in this filed. He produces dairy products and sells them together with the harvested grapes and vegetables at the local market. The family's additional income is from Gocha\u2019s parent\u2019s monthly pensions.\r\n \r\nGocha requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Gocha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Gocha will build a greenhouse. He wants to expand his agricultural business and start selling vegetables not only in summer but also in winter. For this reason, he will build a greenhouse and plant different types of vegetables.

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Emzar will purchase cheese at the wholesale price. He will smoke the cheese and sell it at a higher price to earn a good profit. Smoked cheese is very consumable in Georgia.

lives in the Nkubu area of Kenya, which grows a lot of 'miraa', which can be chewed like tobacco. She has three children and has been doing agribusiness for 15 years.  Her primary income sources are eggs, tea, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: The returns she gets from her farm produce enable her to sustain her family. Her biggest challenge is 'Drought,pests and diseases.' Animals on the farm have been given no names.\r\n\r\nJoyce was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Lower interest rate compared to others.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'They offer loans to farmers and repayment are made per monthly instalments.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit her family?' Joyce replied, 'It will enable my children to further their education.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Joyce owns the following: 'poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'cow, pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, electricity, running water, TV' but does not have 'solar power, sewing machine, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":149.36,"image":{"id":1370014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase irrigation equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2207.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2265.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2325.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2386.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2449.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2514.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2581.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2649.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2719.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2791.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2865.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2940.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3018.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3098.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.63,"local_amount":2242.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2266.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960577,"comment":null},{"amount":27.34,"local_amount":2301.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820251,"comment":null},{"amount":86.42,"local_amount":7277.41,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":7354.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880865,"comment":null},{"amount":8.97,"local_amount":755.16,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":763.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529493,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T20:28:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571251,"name":"Al-Akhwh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Al-Akhwh and consists of four women who live in Aden, Yemen.

They have milk cows and a plot of land. The cows are milked every day to produce dairy products, and on the land potatoes are grown. Harvested products along with the dairy products are sold at the local markets and among the villagers. \r\n\r\nRoman requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Roman will purchase calves. He will grow calves for a couple of months and then sell them at a higher price. This new business will give him an opportunity to earn a good profit. Roman is a very hardworking man and he wants to use part of the profit for his agricultural activities in order to expand more. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She is a 19-year-old woman whose family is made up of her spouse and their small daughter who is less than a year old. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 2012, Rosa, excited by her friend's support, began selling a variety of commodities that she had shared with her in order to generate income since Rosa was not tied to any business that would give catalogs to its buyers in order to promote their products to their clients. \r\n\r\nLittle by little, Rosa's clientele grew and this helped her to have her own direct tie which helped her sell at more competitive prices. That is why today she offers perfume, purses, and feminine accessories through specialized item guides. From among their offers she chooses those that go on sale, in order to sell to her clients at good prices and also generate more income with a rapid rotation of inventory. \r\n\r\nHer clientele is made up of her neighbors and those referred by them, that support her with the structural growth of her business. Rosa is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she will get through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy creams, perfume, and feminine accessories that have been ordered by her clientele. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to increase her working capital as well as her sales, in order to improve her family's way of life. Her greatest challenge was finding sources of financing and that is just what her Kiva loan will do. It will lead to a successful investment which will become a stepping stone to help her achieve her dreams of prosperity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":243.16,"image":{"id":1370266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy creams, perfume, and feminine accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":71955},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":73634},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75352},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77111},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":78910},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":80751},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":82635},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":84563},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":86537},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":88552}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.03},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.23,"local_amount":71955,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":72876.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968343,"comment":null},{"amount":39.11,"local_amount":73634,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":74577.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817519,"comment":null},{"amount":40.03,"local_amount":75352,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":76317.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323795,"comment":null},{"amount":40.97,"local_amount":77111,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":78098.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083024,"comment":null},{"amount":41.92,"local_amount":78910,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":79920.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062377,"comment":null},{"amount":42.9,"local_amount":80751,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":81785.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732074,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T20:55:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571428,"name":"Dilcia Varinia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dilcia es una mujer casada y madre de 2 hijos con 35 a\u00f1os de edad ella es agricultora y ama de casa con 6 a\u00f1os de educaci\u00f3n cursados en la primaria.

Her husband works as a handyman doing home repairs.  For a long time, Qumrinisso stayed at home and raised her children, but now her children are grown and have started families of their own and become independent, she has decided to start a small business.  Following the advice of her friends, she began selling stationery and office supplies.  She enjoys this work very much, as it gives her a good income.  Her suppliers bring her goods at low prices and she sells them at her local market at a markup.  Working for herself makes Qumrinisso feel independent.  She tries to help her children.  At the moment, she wants to buy a stock of office supplies, as demand for her goods increases every day.  She has decided to turn to Arvand for a loan, as she does not have enough money in hand for this.  Qumrinisso thanks Arvand in advance for their help and support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":255.13,"image":{"id":1371593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":" to purchase of office supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Qumrinisso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":40.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":41.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":47.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":53.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.05,"local_amount":40.05,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":40.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616139,"comment":null},{"amount":41.01,"local_amount":41.01,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":41.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860009,"comment":null},{"amount":41.99,"local_amount":41.99,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":41.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136753,"comment":null},{"amount":42.99,"local_amount":42.99,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900948,"comment":null},{"amount":44.02,"local_amount":44.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":44.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550129,"comment":null},{"amount":45.07,"local_amount":45.07,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":45.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774352,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571366,"name":"Hanan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanan was born in 1993.

She has had her retail clothing and shoe sales business for around five years.\r\n\r\nJuana plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying many dozens of each product in order to sell them to her clients in her community.  She will use the additional profits to save, to supply some of the needs of her children, and for her home.  Juana dreams of becoming professional and having a successful business.

He would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Ibrahim requires a loan in order to buy more medicines for resale. He hopes that this loan will support him through proper use. In the future, Ibrahim plans to expand by selling drugs on a wholesale basis and to educate his children up to university level. He thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":705,"image":{"id":1370305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"to buy more medicines for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Freetown East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2013-06-16T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-16T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":508547.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390494656,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":508547.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399742833,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":508547.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410012998,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":508547.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776054,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":508547.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429425762,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":508547.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439644288,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T21:11:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571541,"name":"Nuulopa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nuulopa is a 42-year-old married woman with 11 children.

And while for some people, tax preparation may not seem like exciting work, for Debora it has become a calling to help Spanish-speaking immigrants still learning about U.S. financial and taxation systems.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like helping the community,\u201d Debora said. \u201cA lot of people, when they come to me and I explain to them: this number represents your earnings, this and these are your deductions, this is your refund or what you owe, what they tell me is that no one has ever taken the time to explain anything to them. I always try to make sure people understand what they are signing.\u201d \r\n\r\nDebora got the idea to become a tax preparer while she was still working at a bank as a customer service representative. Friends and acquaintances were inquiring about tax filing, so she referred them to her tax preparer, who asked Debora for assistance as an intermediary. \r\n\r\n\u201cI was faxing information to her and relaying information to the tax preparer, going back and forth and I stopped and thought about it,\u201d Debora said. \u201cAnd I decided that I should take some classes and learn more about tax preparation. And I made a determination that this was something I wanted to do. And my business has been growing every year.\u201d\r\n\r\nDebora started work as a tax preparer four years ago, opening D&C Tax Service around the time her second child was born. Becoming her own boss has afforded her more freedom to manage her time and make business decisions than working for a corporation. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf you have a vision in your mind, you can decide for yourself after weighing the good and bad whether to take the risks,\u201d Debora said. \r\n\r\nDebora learned about Accion Texas Inc. when she saw an Accion vehicle in the parking lot of her bank. She went online to learn more and decided to apply for a loan to bring her business to the next level. \r\n\r\nDebora is using her $5,450 loan for working capital, to pay for liability insurance, and professional development and training to gain certification in different areas of taxation, so she can offer new services. She has taken classes to become a notary. She is going to take classes through her professional organization to learn more about how health care reform will have an impact on taxation. She wants to learn more specifics about the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s collections processes. \r\n\r\nDebora said she is looking into the costs and benefits of renting office space and hiring an assistant. For the moment, she said her tax preparation service offers her the opportunity to work from home and to help the community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1468.39,"image":{"id":1370342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

is an entrepreneur from Matamoros, Mexico, where he owned a car wash business for 20 years before he crossed the border to neighboring Brownsville 12 years ago to unite with his wife and children, all American citizens. When Ricardo first moved to Brownsville, he worked at a car wash, and later for a construction company.\r\n\r\nIt was while Ricardo was working for a construction company that he got the idea to combine the knowledge that he gained when he owned the car wash in Mexico with what he learned working in construction to form a new company: A. Professional Power Wash. \r\n\r\n\u201cI learned that there was a big need for maintaining parking lots,\u201d Ricardo said. \u201cSo I decided to start this business three years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicardo and his six part-time employees power wash the blacktops of parking lots and other asphalt surfaces, apply the black sealant to protect the asphalt, and paint the stripes on the surface to create parking spaces or traffic stripes.\r\n\r\nAfter three years, Ricardo said his business is thriving, but he hopes to grow his business and to employ more people. \r\n\r\nAn acquaintance of his \u2013 another business owner in the construction business \u2013  told him about Accion Texas Inc., saying that borrowing money to finance his growth plans would help him build his credit. \r\n\r\n\u201cHe said that in the United States, you borrow money to help build your credit and to help your business grow,\u201d Ricardo said. \u201cSo I found Accion and I applied for a loan. And I am so glad that there are people like your company to help business owners like me.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicardo said his experience with Accion was very enlightening and helped him to learn more about credit in the United States. He is using his $5,450 loan to buy supplies for his business and to pay for expenses related to marketing. Ricardo said his business has grown mostly through referrals. He is hoping with brochures describing his services, he will more quickly be able to grow his business.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am doing a presentation with a business that has stores all over Texas and they are looking for someone to take care of all the stores in the Valley,\u201d Ricardo said. \u201cI think they will accept my proposal because I am providing a good service at a good price.

","en":"Everlides is 41 years old. She lives in the south of the city where she earns a living by offering washing machine rental services, domestic services and other commercial services that allow her to supplement her income, meet her expenses, and raise the standard of living for her 14 year old daughter who she dreams will grow up to be a successful professional. She began this work in 1999 and from this point on she has gained experience, little by little. She works from 7 in the morning to 6 in the evening. Her goal is to ensure her washing business is sustainable, so that she dedicate all of her time to it. However, her biggest challenge is maintaining sufficient working capital to increase the services she offers by having more machines with the goal of obtaining greater profits. Today, Everlides is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With this loan she will buy two washing machines for clothes and begin to complete her dream of prosperity--to simply increase her profits and ensure that her investments are successful."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":227.11,"image":{"id":1370335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","use":"to

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php15,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nJoesa dreams of expanding her business, and hopes that her children will finish their schooling.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and she also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance

He is married and raising three children. His wife is a housewife and works with raising the children. Janobiddin's mother and sister also live in their house. He is the sole provider of this large family. \r\n\r\nJanobiddin has worked with producing gates for more than 9 months.

A niece also lives with the family and helps with household and farm chores just like the rest of her children. Ever since she was a young girl Mar\u00eda has helped in the fields, continuing a family tradition passed down through the generations. Her parents taught her about farming while she was still a child.\r\n\r\nThe land that Mar\u00eda and her family farm came to her through an inheritance and money that remained after reinvesting in their coffee crop. It is located about 45 minutes from their house by vehicle, a journey they make daily.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is seeking a loan to buy fertilizer and other supplies to improve their crops and ensure they have a viable harvest to sell. Her goal is to have the best harvest in the area so as to attract customers and sell all that is produced. Her dreams are to help her children get ahead by providing them with a good education so they can overcome easily and safely the challenges in their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10.8,"image":{"id":1370424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy fertilizer and other supplies for her coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Taulabe, Siguatepeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-06-16T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-16T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Erlinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7.11,"local_amount":142.25,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":144.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381922871,"comment":null},{"amount":1.65,"local_amount":33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":33.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390787346,"comment":null},{"amount":0.39,"local_amount":7.75,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":7.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070268,"comment":null},{"amount":1.6,"local_amount":32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":32.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042173,"comment":null},{"amount":0.05,"local_amount":1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710515,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T10:22:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571703,"name":"Georgina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Georgina is 49 years old and married with three children.\r\n\r\nGeorgina works hard to provide for her family.

He is pleased to work, and he believes that he is doing well because of his good performance and because he treats those around him with friendliness.\r\n\r\nCarlos is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help given, he will be able to cover the paperwork-processing costs for obtaining the property title to a small piece of land, which is destined for building his home upon it. Therefore, Carlos will continue to work and exert himself to achieve his greatest dream of having a stable and suitable home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":164.86,"image":{"id":1370436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"cover
