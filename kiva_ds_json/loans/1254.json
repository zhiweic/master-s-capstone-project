Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the main goals in my life is to get a higher education, to become a highly qualified person. I am happy to enroll in AUCA this year. I had many reasons to enroll in AUCA, including the notable reasons of methodology, quality of the education, relationship of professors and resources that are available for the students. I had the honor to study at the New Generation Academy of AUCA. This is a unique program that started only this year for only 70 of the most intelligent students and I was lucky to be amongst those. During the year, we have been able to get great experience, skills and preparation for university entrance. While studying at the Academy, I developed even more desire to enroll in AUCA. Unlike all other universities, AUCA is considered to be one of the leading universities in our country and even in all Central Asia.\r\n \r\nSince I was in school, I did well in those assignments that consisted of interpretation, presentation, constructing reports and stories; and researching some interesting items. I think those things have been very useful for my future career. I think that I became a person who can make people interested in my information and change the way they think about certain subjects. I consider myself to be a good candidate for the Journalism and Mass Communication department. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I would like to mention is that AUCA gives many opportunities to all its students. The loan opportunity is among those opportunities. I would like to take this opportunity to apply for a Kiva loan, which is a great chance to be able to cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1461109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The family lives in poverty, and thus, Besik decided to start his own business. \r\n\r\nAll the financial institutions rejected Besik's loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Besik applied for credit from Credo. His request was approved under the framework of Credo's start up loan program, which is joint initiative with Kiva. A loan of $2,000 will help the family to purchase raw materials and start making Georgian Khachapuri (cheese pie). Elene has experience in this field and she will get orders for making Khachapuri.

She does not have enough money to serve all her customers and so she can only serve a limited number of customers in a given day. This means the business loses out on potential profits. It is for this reason that she has requested a Kiva loan. The loan will go towards serving her customers by providing working capital.\r\n\r\nPetronella has high hopes for the future; she is hopeful that accessing this loan will be the start of significant growth in the business. The anticipated growth will also help her in her personal life. She explains that in her household, it is only herself and her father who have a source of income.

They have a jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, and is paying a boundary (daily quota) each day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a 40,000 PHP [Philippines pesos] loan.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

years old, married and raising six children together with her husband. Atyrkul has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Atyrkul is involved in animal husbandry, having started 33 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 14,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Atyrkul's hard work, today her business contains 4 dairy cows, 1 horse, 3 goats and 5 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 14,000 som (KGS).

This is her motivation and she wants to see her land under cultivation. It is located 4 kilometers from her house and every morning her and her husband walk the 25 minutes it takes to get to the plantation. They work hard to clean and care for their crops as they are worried about infestations. However they are optimistic and affirm that they will have an excellent harvest.\r\n\r\nFor this reason Maria needs a loan to buy agricultural supplies to apply technical support for her coffee crops buying fertilizer, foliar spray, manure etc. She dreams of expanding her plantation as this is her only way of securing her family's future given that each day's financial situation is precarious.

From Monday through Saturday she prepares the raw materials, measures them, kneads them, molds them and cooks them, adding the products and ingredients necessary for each one, such as cheese, meat and vegetables, etc.  The result is delicious snack ready to sell and eat. She starts her work day at 8 am and finishes at 6 pm. She buys the products from warehouses in the municipality. Her principal clients live in the area where she lives and has her business.

On his land, David grows maize, beans, rice and cassava. He also has chickens and pigs. David has served as a CKW for the last two years and he looks forward to renewing his CKW contract for the next three years. As a CKW, he will use the materials in his business-in-a-box (smartphone, solar charging set, and weighing scale) to disseminate vital agricultural information to the other members of his village, which will help them to improve their crop yields and increase their incomes.

is an experienced agronomist from Lusaghbyur village in the Lori region. She lives with her husband, daughter, and her elderly parents-in-law. She and her husband work in the military service. They are the only breadwinners of the family. Their salaries, however, are so low that they cannot afford a living based on those salaries. To be able to cover their daily needs, Armenuhi and her family are engaged in breeding cows, pigs, piglets, and hens, and in the cultivation of wheat, potatoes, apples and pears. They realize the agricultural products in the local market.

As a main source of income for her family, Patila works with livestock breeding, after having started 20 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Patila's persistent work, her farm currently has one dairy cow and ten sheep. The monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Patila turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep to increase the number of livestock. Patila plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals.

","en":"Nigora is a young and very hard-working woman, 28 years of age. She is a successful entrepreneur. \r\nShe has 10 year of experience in retail and has been able to improve her outcomes during this time. She sells groceries. Nigora is married and has one child. She lives with her family in the J. Rasulov region. Her sales point is at the central market, in a busy location. Her husband works at private construction sites, and in his free time helps his wife. This summer Nigora has completed some minor remodeling of her summer kitchen; in order to do  this, she had to spend money taken out of her working capital.

His wife busies herself with sewing at home, while Kholmat works as a home repair contractor.  As winter draws near, Kholmat has been getting fewer and fewer clients, and has been earning less as a result, which is why he's decided he'd like to start up his own cattle-selling business.  He already has a cow barn at his house, and also has 200 bundles of hay on hand made from corn stalks.  \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to buy a couple of young bulls for his business.  He plans on fattening the bulls for around 30-35 days, then selling them at a local market.  With the help of this loan, Kholmat will have the makings of a profitable business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1461303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy 2 young bulls of good pedigree.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T20:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T20:40:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kholmat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":148.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":153.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":157.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":161.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":170.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":175.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":180.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":185.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":190.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":196.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":201.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":207.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":213.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":219.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":225.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":231.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":238.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":244.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":251.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":258.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":265.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":273.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":281.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T01:39:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626688,"name":"Efua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Although she has received no prior formal education, Efua is an entrepreneur.

It is a community with a lot of trees.  Its inhabitants are very happy people who are hard-working, and, above all, they are entrepreneurs who almost never have time for other activities.  This is because they are always busy with their businesses.  \r\n\r\nThey did not want to have a common name, and because flower or plant names are very repetitive, they decided to look for a fruit name, and mangos occurred to them.\r\n\r\nAmanda, age 52, has been married to Rub\u00e9n for 30 years.  Together they have formed a family with four children, who are no longer dependent upon the couple.  Amanda has been raising and fattening pigs to sell for 15 years.  She has a very good structure for having a lot of pigs.  To date she has 40 very well-fed pigs.\r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting a loan from VisionFund and Kiva to buy feed for her pigs that she has at her house.  Amanda never buys pigs from other people.  Her own pigs give birth to little pigs, and those are the ones she raises and fattens to later sell to a fixed buyer.  The buyer makes carnitas every day.  She also sells to another customer in the municipality, and her sale is assured.\r\n\r\nAmanda states, \u201cI don\u2019t have any difficulty because I have had the experience of raising these animals ever since I was little.  It is a business activity that I inherited from my parents\u201d.  Amanda\u2019s dream is to be able to have a more money in order to have more pigs.  She has always liked having animals, and she would not like not raising them.  This is because, with her income, she helps her husband with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAmanda is grateful for her loan.  The rest of the group is also grateful to invest in their businesses.  Lucia and Placida will buy tortillas, Nayeli and Brigida will buy feed for their pigs, Jos\u00e9 Juan will buy chickens, and Martha will buy flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1463068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed for her pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SanTa Rosa de Lima El oro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Juan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayeli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Placida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":8462.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644487,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8462.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877948,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-11T17:43:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626676,"name":"Nohn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nohn is 47 years old, and she has been living in Sanniquellie, the capital city of Nimba County which is rich in natural resources.

With this funding, Ramon will create three new jobs, employing two new tattoo artists and a piercing professional. His tattoo and piercing parlor will cater to the growing population that want a tattoo but have yet to experience one, and those who want an old tattoo covered up. Traditional banks turned him down; however, Fresno CDFI is stepping up to the plate to help Ramon achieve his dream!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":372.14,"image":{"id":1461629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

Elodia es una mujer muy joven pero sobretodo muy alegre tiene 24 a\u00f1os sin embrago a su corta edad tiene un gran esp\u00edritu emprendedor, vive en uni\u00f3n libre desde hace seis a\u00f1os con Jaime quien trabaja en la construcci\u00f3n de casas, juntos han formado una familia con dos ni\u00f1os su ni\u00f1o m\u00e1s grande tiene cinco a\u00f1os aun no asiste a la escuela y su bebe.

They belong to the same community, which is very beautiful and interesting because it has various festivals all year, and above all because they preserve their culture like their native language and very colorful dress. They chose the name of the group themselves because of the small river that they live close to. The people in the community use its water for many things. \r\n\r\nElodia is a 24-year-old young woman who is very happy and despite her young age has a great, enterprising spirit.  She has been in a free union with her husband Jaime (who works in construction) for 6 years.  Together, they have a family with 2 children.  Their youngest child is their 5-year-old who hasn't started school yet.  They also have an infant.\r\n\r\nElodia has worked raising chickens and turkeys for 5 years.  She learned how to raise them from chicks until they become adults thanks to her mother.  When she decided to start her own family, she decided to find some way to help her husband with the household expenses and started raising chickens on her own.  She isn't able to leave the house to work because her children are young and there is no one else to take care of them.\r\n\r\nElodia is very grateful to Kiva and Vision Fund for the loan because it will allow her to buy her small turkeys and chickens.  She will take care of them in her house for 8 months and then either sell them or use them to feed her family to save on food expenses.  The only problem that Eloida has is when her animals get sick and die.  She thinks that it is often because it is very cold and she doesn't have a coop for them.  This challenge doesn't discourage her, however, because these things happen.\r\n\r\nElodia's only goal is to be able to have more chickens and turkeys, since they sell very well during holidays in her community.  Elodia mentioned that \"I am fortunate to have my own house but I would like to improve it so as to have access to all basic utilities and live better.\"  In addition, one of Elodia's dreams is to pay for the education of her children and allow them to study to have professional jobs.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group and very happy and grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva because they will be able to invest in their businesses.  Tomasa will be able to buy bull calves while Luisa, Rosaura, Pilar, Tomasa, and Antonia are asking for loans to buy sheep.  Finally, Herlinda will be able to stock her grocery store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2162.5,"image":{"id":1460796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy chickens and turkeys.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Antonio La Cienega, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T22:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T22:20:01Z","loan_amount":4325,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Pilar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elodia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosaura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":540.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":540.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":540.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":540.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":540.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":540.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":540.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":540.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1081.25,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":14077.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644495,"comment":null},{"amount":1081.25,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-24T09:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":14077.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877956,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-05T20:25:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626819,"name":"Junalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of one child, Junalyn works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nJunalyn has a general store business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from raising pigs.

He left his town of birth and headed for the city because of violence.  With his wife and children, he came to the city in search of new opportunities and to start from scratch. Samir left behind his home and business.  Here in the city it was difficult to find work and so Samir approached short-term loan sharks in order to buy fruits and vegetables, which he would then sell as a street vendor.  This is how he started his own business and now he also works as a temporary labourer in the construction industry, in order to supplement his income.  He goes between both jobs and is able to earn enough money to cover household costs.  Samir's drive, perseverance and optimism have allowed him to achieve his goals and he now wants to strengthen his business with the help of this loan:  with it, he will do up his new cart, buy a big parasol, buy stock (in-season fruits and vegetables) in bulk, and pay off a loan.  This will allow Samir to increase his assets and will improve his ability to sell a higher quantity of products.  The new cart is to give to one of his children, who will use it to work and bring in an income to support the household economy.  This loan will allow Samir to pay off his other loan, which has very high interest rates and is affecting his financial situation.  Samir wants to keep fighting and achieve his dream of having his own house.  With a house, he can have his own premises for his business, making it profitable and guaranteeing a good financial situation for his family.  Samir will then be able to enjoy a higher quality of life alongside his loved ones.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":63.34,"image":{"id":1463579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to do up his new cart, to buy a big parasol, to buy stock (in-season fruits and vegetables) in bulk, and to pay off a loan.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T23:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T23:00:10Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samir Gregorio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":56693},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":58262},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":59875},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":61532},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":63235},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64986},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66784},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":68633}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.95,"local_amount":58092,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":60462.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074814,"comment":null},{"amount":31.39,"local_amount":57075,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":59403.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440010013,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T18:26:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":628158,"name":"Telma Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Telma es una mujer joven de 28 a\u00f1os de edad emprendedora, luchadora con muchas ganas de salir adelante que junto a su esposo se dedican a la agricultura con el cual procreo 3 hijos los cuales viven en casa y estudian en la escuela de la comunidad.

He is married and has two children. For the last five years, Shuhrat has worked hard in order to manage his store where he sells head wear. Striving to expand his business, Shuhrat applied for a loan from Arvand. \r\n\r\nShuhrat will use the current to purchase a car, so that it will be easier for him to transport his goods. Up until now he has transported goods by shuttle bus and it has been very hard for him. Shuhrat hopes that receiving a loan and purchasing a car will ease his work.

They live in a place called \u2018El Oro\u2019 [The Gold] because gold was previously taken from the mines.  The place is also well-known for a railroad car, which now functions as a restaurant.  One of the members of the group said, \u201cThis railroad car was only a little part of the train that was left here.  However, it now functions as a restaurant that is well-known by the people.  The delicious cafes are the best of the place\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe El Oro municipality is known as \u2018Pueblo M\u00e1gico\u2019 [Magic Town], a name given to different colonial cities in the country.  J. Carmen, or Carmelo, as he is better known, is a member of the Artesanos del Oro group.  He is 52 years old, and he has been married to Rosaura for several years.  Together they have formed a family with eight children.  Three of the children are still dependent upon them and are in school.\r\n\r\nCarmelo has had a small carpentry business for seven years.  This time he is requesting a loan to buy wood, particle board, Resistol glue, and nails, etc. in order to make furniture like wardrobes, kitchen cabinets, tables, and chairs.  He says that he started his business activity because it was one of the trades he learned when he was young.  \u201cThanks to the loan, I have been able to maintain my carpentry business.  Without the loans from VisionFund and Kiva, I would not have been able to continue with my business activity.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis biggest difficulty is the lack of employment in the municipality where he lives and the little work obtained.  Carmelo\u2019s work is only by order.  If they come to request a piece of furniture from him, he makes it.  He is also considering setting out for other places in order to get more customers.  His earnings help him a lot.  This way he is able to pay his children\u2019s educational expenses.  He wants to continue helping with his children\u2019s educational expenses so that they are able to graduate from college.\r\n\r\nThat is why Carmelo needs his loan, and the members of the group also need their loan to invest in their business activities.  Antonio will buy medication and food for his veterinary business, Abigail will invest in her brass handicrafts, Ang\u00e9lica will buy feed for pigs, and Magali will buy \u2018ocoxal\u2019 [leaf used for handicrafts].\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2823.76,"image":{"id":1462926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy wood and particle board.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"J.

They have known each other for a number of years and during this time they have built up a close and sincere friendship. They live in a Mazahua community where some people still communicate in their native language. Nowadays very few women still wear the typical local dress which is characterized by very bright colors. Something very characteristic of the community where the group is based is its very green pasture land and the beautiful scenery of wooded hills. \r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica (also called Vero) is a member of the \"Barrio La Ca\u00f1ada\u201d group. She is 32 years old, has been married to Esequiel for five years. He works as a civil engineer. Together they have formed a family with two children who attend preschool. Vero has had a grocery store for the past year, which still does not have a name. She says that she wanted to have a grocery store like her father: \"When I lived with my father I liked to tend to the store because it everything was sold there and I had a lot of contact with people.\" She says that she started with very little merchandise, only perishable products like eggs, oils, sardines, tuna, canned beans, detergents, etc. \r\n\r\nShe did not have shelves or a refrigerator either, and this did not allow her to sell products like ham, cheese, sausages, etc. But, with her savings, with the profits obtained from the sale of her products, she has been able to grow her grocery store. Now she has more merchandise, shelves for her products, and also a refrigerator. Now she does sell all of the products and also can sell cold refreshments which people requested a lot. This time Vero is requesting a loan to buy more merchandise like bread, eggs, milk, sugar, soft drinks, etc. \r\n\r\nHer only difficulty is the competition in the same community. However, Vero is not worried because she will continue working very hard in order to have a store just like her father's store. Her father's store has all of the products that Vero is lacking, various things like brooms, mops, dish towels, etc. She says, \"This is one of my biggest goals, to have more merchandise, to be able to improve our quality of life, and also to pay for the education costs of our children without worries.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are thankful because they will use the loan in their economic activities, which will perhaps help them to improve their profits and expand their business. Irma, Adriana, Marcelina, and Mar\u00eda Elsa will invest in their grocery stores, Rosario and Mar\u00eda Juana will invest in their sheep, and Ma Rosario will invest in the sale of clothing. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2640.62,"image":{"id":1460821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy milk, bread, eggs, soft drinks, canned goods etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Jeronimo de los Dolores, San Felipe del Progre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":4225,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":528.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1056.25,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":13751.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644493,"comment":null},{"amount":1584.37,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-24T09:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20627.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877954,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-05T23:20:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":628172,"name":"Melba","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Por Un Nuevo Amanecer se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMarilyn dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her child will finish his studies.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":183.33,"image":{"id":1461752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":4667,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5032.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478878,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.37,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2874.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701280,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-05T06:54:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626881,"name":"Beverly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beverly works hard to support her family.

Thanks to this, at certain times when her husband is out of work, she is able to continue forward. \r\n\r\nThis loan is for stocking her business even more. She is going to buy juice, ice cream, cola, etc. She has been in the communal bank almost from the beginning, and she likes it for the benefits and help that the organization offers to her. Her dreams are to get ahead and to enjoy good health. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":406.24,"image":{"id":1463611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase juice, ice cream, cola, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":636.09,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":79.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":238.53,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":243.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506486,"comment":null},{"amount":162.49,"local_amount":159.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":162.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730243,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-05T06:54:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626919,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is 29 years old and is married to Hellen.

Bunusa has a higher education. To provide the primary income for her family, Bunusa is involved in animal husbandry, having started 10 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Bunusa's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and also a 0.74 hectare land plot, where she annually grows corn and wheat. The monthly income amounts to 17,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Bunusa requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows for fattening up and subsequent resale. Bunusa plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to repair a

","en":"Tahmina is a modern woman, who was born in 1981. She is married and is raising three children. As a child Tahmina was taught by a dressmaker how to make women's clothes. Tahmina is now an experienced dressmaker. She has been working as a seamstress for over 7 years. She works from home and tries to create good living conditions for her children. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation.
