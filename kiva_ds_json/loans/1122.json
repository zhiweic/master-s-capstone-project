Since 2003, she has been working as a tailor. She provides stitching services in her community. Her eldest daughter also helps her in sewing dresses. She has excellent skills and, due to the money she generates, she has managed to provide a better quality of life for her family. Her greatest wish is to expand her business and to buy another sewing machine, as the number of her customers increases day by day. However, because she has only one machine, she cannot easily meet  with all the customer demand on time, and that results in a loss of money and customers. Therefore, she is applying for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to invest in the purchase of a sewing machine, which will allow her to cover the demands of customers more efficiently and to elevate her level of income. With the profits, she will pay the educational expenses of her children.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nPatmabaim requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Patmabaim has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Patmabaim will purchase milking cows. After purchasing milking cows, she will be able to produce dairy products to sell at local markets. This will increase the income of the family.

Later, she worked in a business as a laborer. She stopped working there and with her severance, she decided to earn her living raising and selling pigs, always with the objective of providing for her children. \r\n\r\nLater, after hearing a talk on selling makeup, she worked selling cosmetics. Little by little, she began purchasing other products like clothing, perfumes, and jewelry. She has been in this business for five years; she sells from door to door at homes, businesses, factories, and to other neighborhood customers.\r\n\r\nAt this time, she needs a loan to purchase clothing and perfumes to sell, mainly because the Mother's Day celebration is approaching. She wants to set up a shop selling a variety of merchandise; her short-term goal is to buy a display case to exhibit her products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1353188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothing and perfumes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-05-19T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-18T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De La Concepcion \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.36,"local_amount":33.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":33.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381972010,"comment":null},{"amount":33.63,"local_amount":33.63,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":33.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837376,"comment":null},{"amount":33,"local_amount":33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860658,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":33.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":33.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349364,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":33.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":33.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901482,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":33.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":33.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550612,"comment":null},{"amount":100.02,"local_amount":100.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440022061,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T00:22:26Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:49:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":560322,"name":"Maxima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maxima, a 48-year-old teacher, is married to Laurensius, a 48-year-old driver.

Without the funds received from his most recent loan with Accion, Danny would not have been able to complete the repairs on his work vehicle, which would have crippled his ability to fulfill customer\u2019s orders.

They are going through a very difficult time, as the net income of her husband is not enough to sustain the family life. \r\n\r\nHer husband owns a general store near his house, which is the only source of income for the family. He sells a variety of products in his store. Presently, he is interested to offer more variety to his customers. However, due to the lack of finances, he finds it difficult. \r\n\r\nTherefore his wife, Nusrat, has requested a loan amount of 30,000 PKR from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to purchase rusk, cake, biscuits, bread, bubbles, and popcorn to sell. This will help him to increase his net income and savings as well.\r\n\r\nWith the profit amount, Nusrat wants to construct her house. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":240.11,"image":{"id":1352568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

lives in the Muranga area of Kenya, which lies in the central Rift Valley.  She has three children and has been doing this work for 21 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, crops and her personal business.\r\n\r\nSusan stated what is most enjoyable about farming, \"The returns I get from the work I do.\"  Her biggest challenge is, \"Getting the right breed when doing artificial insemination.\"  Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Kilindi, Mzungu, Bahati.'\r\n\r\nSusan was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Juhudi has favorable terms.\"   Susan was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session and she said, \"They support farmers in doing agribusiness.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming.  When asked how will this loan benefit her family, Susan replied \"Income from the sale of milk will cater for her family's needs.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.  Susan owns the following: 'cow, poultry, pump, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

Her loan requests were rejected each time because of her low income and their family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMarine's retirement pension is her only source of income. According to Credo estimations, she belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Marine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

is 27 years old.

His loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nThe family does not have a source of income. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nJemal requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Jemal has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of a business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Jemal will purchase grocery inventory to open a grocery shop. He already has a commercial space ready to open a shop. After purchasing the inventory the family will start working in the shop themselves to decrease the expenses of paying salary to somebody else. This will increase the profit. Part of the profit they make will be used for reinvesting in the same business, in order to have a better variety of merchandise to offer to the clients and another part will be used for the family's well being.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":703.91,"image":{"id":1352699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How one could benefit from an Micro Finance Institution to boost capital and repay the loan with ease.'\n\nGladys's highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit her family', Gladys replied, 'Will be able to increase acreage for more production.'\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Gladys owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":227.24,"image":{"id":1351894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To improve her horticultural farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.59,"local_amount":2207,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2317.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516904,"comment":null},{"amount":28.32,"local_amount":2265.34,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2378.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960520,"comment":null},{"amount":29.07,"local_amount":2325.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2441.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820179,"comment":null},{"amount":29.83,"local_amount":2386.68,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417275,"comment":null},{"amount":30.62,"local_amount":2449.77,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2572.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980824,"comment":null},{"amount":31.43,"local_amount":2514.53,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2640.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880792,"comment":null},{"amount":32.26,"local_amount":2580.99,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2710.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529434,"comment":null},{"amount":18.12,"local_amount":1449.22,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753375,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T06:29:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":560672,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is 49 years old.

His loan requests were rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have four milk cows and a plot of agricultural land, where apple trees are grown. The cows are milked every day to make cheese. Harvested apples and cheese are sold locally at the markets and the family gets a small monthly income. This is the only source of living for them, which is rarely enough for covering the food expenses.  \r\n\r\nDavid requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. David has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, David will purchase chicks. He will raise the chicks and sell them later at a higher price to earn a good profit. Part of the profit David will use to reinvest in the same business and develop his farming.

is 21 years old and lives in the town of Lugazi in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has two children who are currently both in school. For the past two years, Doreen has been working hard to manage her small knitting business, which makes knit sweaters. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Doreen has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more thread to knit sweaters to sell, and will help Doreen to generate greater profits and improve on her family's standard of living. Doreen hopes that in the future she will become a very rich businesswoman in town and also start supplying schools with sweaters. \r\n\r\nDoreen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Phiona is 19 years old and lives in the town of Lugazi in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past two years, Phiona has been working hard to manage her small business, through which she sells fresh fruit. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Phiona has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more fresh fruit to sell, and will help Phiona to generate greater profits and take care of her child and her family. Phiona hopes that in the future she will be able to increase her capital in her business. \r\n\r\nPhiona is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

from Zimbabwe! This is 39-year-old Janet from Bulawayo. She is divorced and has one child.  Janet runs a retail business selling clothes, shoes, night dresses and fashion shoes.

This is 36-year-old Moasi from Masvingo. Moasi is a single parent with three children; two are attending school. Moasi runs a retail business which sells groceries. The business has been in operation for one year now.

This is 39-year-old Tracy from Mutare. Tracy is married with two children, both attending school. She also cares for three dependents. Tracy runs a retail business; she sells clothes, shoes and electrical gadgets. The business has been in operation for four years.

They are a group of six women from a tribal community and live in a very small and remote village in the state of Manipur, in the Northeastern part of India.\r\n\r\nThe profile representative of \u201cNgailut\u201d Group is Nengneikim. She is the one on the extreme left of the picture with her right hand raised. She has two sons and one daughter and her husband is a daily wage earner whose income is not enough to meet the daily expenses of the family. Being a woman, she cannot do hard labor work so she weaves and, with the minimal sum of money she gets, she runs the house.  \r\n\r\nShe is an active member of the group and a very efficient, dedicated and hardworking woman. With the first loan from WSDS, she bought two piglets. After a year and half, they had grown to full size and were ready to be sold in the market. With the profit she earned, she could repay the loan on time and with the remaining, she was able to buy some other essential requirements for the family and some household items.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, she will buy four piglets and construct a bigger pigsty to set up a piggery farm in the future. She also said that she has a bigger dream of purchasing a mini van for public transportation, which she said will benefit the people in her village and the surrounding villages and at the same time she will also be able to benefit from it. In order to fulfill her dreams, she manages regular monthly savings from her profits in her new bank account. And she is hopeful that after five to seven years, she will have enough money to fulfill her dreams. \r\n\r\nShe wants to thank Kiva and WSDS for the support they have rendered to her and to the group. The rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, tailoring, a piggery and other income-generating activities. She said that all of them are eagerly and patiently waiting for the Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1352663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase three more piglets to raise and sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T06:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T06:00:01Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nengneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neijahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T09:43:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":560757,"name":"Hasmik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hasmik is from Gtashen village in the Shirak region, where she lives with her husband, two sons, a daughter-in-law and little grandchildren. Hasmik and her whole family have been involved in agriculture for many years. They keep livestock (27, 85 sheep, 15 pigs and 20 chickens), cultivate barley and grow apple and pear trees. Hasmik, together with her daughter-in-law, milk cows and use the milk to produce cheese. Her husband and sons sell agricultural products locally. The farming business is very important to this family as it is the only source of their income. They all work hard to gather a good harvest and earn a high income.\r\n\r\nThe car, by which they are taking the harvest to the market, is very old and needs to be repaired. Unfortunately, Hasmik has no financial means to repair that car and time after time it is becoming difficult for the family to take the harvest to the market. \r\n\r\nSo, Hasmik has requested a loan from SEF International to, first, repair the car and then expand the farm. With the loan's help, Hasmik will purchase potato and barley seeds and will pay fuel costs. Hasmik is sure that the loan will give them an opportunity to sustain their farm and earn a high enough income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":312,"image":{"id":1352822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to repair her car, to purchase potato and barley seeds and to cover fuel costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Gtashen village, Shirak region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hasmik","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":153.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":157.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":157.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":158.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":161.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":161.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":162.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":168.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":170.16},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":171.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":172.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":173.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":175.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":177.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":178.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.69},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":154,"local_amount":154,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308355,"comment":null},{"amount":158,"local_amount":158,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845634,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T17:48:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":560770,"name":"Sabahat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sabahat is 42 years old, married, and the mother of four children.

She lives in the small village of Ozurgeti District with her husband. They receive a retirement pension. Liana has requested loans  for a proposed family business start-up several times from local financial institutions, but without any success. Each loan request was rejected because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nLiana has a plot of agricultural land where she grows nut trees and has a 0.5 hectare tea plantation. The family also owns a pig and piglets. Although Liana sells the harvested nuts and piglets at a good price, her profit is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLiana requested this loan from Credo for her start-up family business. Liana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credit with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not usually have access to credit products. Such borrowers are regarded as \u201chigh risk\" because of their low income. With this loan, Liana will purchase equipment for picking and drying tea.
