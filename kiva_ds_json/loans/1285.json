Up until now she continues to work; she has no other economic activities, as she must tend to her business, which is a distance of 150 meters from her home.  She walks there every day, and her daughter helps her with the business. \r\n\r\nDeysi is requesting a loan to buy corn from her brother, so that she can make tortillas.  She will also use part of the funds to pay off a debt that she has.  This loan will improve her business, because she will have enough corn to ensure that she has tortillas to sell, and so she will be able to meet the demands of her customers.  The dream of every mother is to see her daughter get a high school degree and achieve her greatest goal. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1505559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn to make tortillas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-04T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deysi Marleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":31.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":33.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":35.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":37.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":40.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":53.09},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":54.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":63.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.09},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T23:26:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653815,"name":"Jeleta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeleta is 56 years old and married with nine children.

Installing this water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

This damaged her otherwise excellent sweet chilis and caused a loss in profits for Erika, her family, and everyone else who did everything they could to strengthen the crops with this loan.  Erika's first loan helped a great deal in supporting her crops but with damage done to three fifths of the land she had planted on, the crop could not be saved.  As a result, Erika was only able to sell part of her yield and so she had difficulties paying back her loan, after she lost some 70% of her cash and crops.

He barely knows how to read and doesn't know how to write.  He did not have a chance to attend school when he was a boy.  His family was of scarce resources and he had to go to work to help the family.  His wife left him and his three children, ages 10, 8, and 5 and he is trying to get them ahead.  The youngest one had an incident that caused him significant burns and for the past year he has had to go to the capital city for therapy, so this gentleman works in farming and selling small animals (chickens, pigs, fish, etc.) to improve his income and earn some extra money.  Teofilo is a good client of Fundacion Campo and this will be his second loan.\r\n\r\nTeofilo knows a lot about farming because he has been doing this since he was a boy and selling small animals for three years.  He has been able to identify a good investment opportunity, since it generated dignified income for him so that he can get his children ahead.  He wants to buy small animals.  He has customers and sales are easy.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan to invest into his small animal business and buy more merchandise (chickens, pigs, fish, etc.) so that he can meet his customer demand and improve his family finances, especially be able to complete his son's treatment due to the burns he received in the accident.\r\n\r\nTheir future family goals are to support their children's education so that they will become professionals, for the small animal business to be more competative, profitable, and for their customers to be satisfied and his offering better seasonal species.

She has two children, and they manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLeovigilda operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 11,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nLeovigilda dreams of expanding her business, and hopes to have a beautiful life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":57.29,"image":{"id":1484930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken, and vegetables and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leovigilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":458.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.29,"local_amount":2291.65,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2508.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701480,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T16:45:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641952,"name":"Ricardo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ricardo is married with one child.

At the time her family was experiencing economic difficulty, so she started her business to help earn money to feed her 5 children and support her family's daily needs. Approximately 8 years ago, Mar\u00eda became solely responsible for her family's well-being, as she suffered the loss of her husband. Nevertheless, despite the pain that she went through, she found the strength to move on. Motivated by her love for her family, she worked hard to grow her business and with the help of local authorities she managed to secure a fixed location from which to sell her food. This has helped her to attract more clients. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is asking for a loan to buy a refrigerator and wholesale ingredients such as meat, flour, cooking oil, vegetables, sodas, and coffee among other items. With these goods she will be able to offer her clients better service and satisfy their demands. She will earn more money with which she will continue to support her children, as well as invest more in strengthening her business.

He is a very hardworking and energetic man. He began his working life in the field, as he he was born into a family in the countryside that taught him all about caring for animals and growing crops. As a result, for many years he worked in agriculture, alternating his work with the sale of snack foods, liquor, sodas, and other products, which he sold to supplement his income. After about 20 years, he came to the city due to the armed conflict and extorsion from criminal gangs that he faced where he previously lived and worked. He was forced to pay the gangs a monthly fee just to be left alone to do his job. Instead, he decided to move and start a general store. He receives help from his wife who manages the store while he works construction jobs on the side. Working together, they have managed to support their family and help their children despite all the difficulties life has presented. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Jorge is asking for a loan to buy goods for his general store (snack foods, sweets, rice, sugar, coffee, cookies, milk, meat, and other basic goods). This will allow him to diversify his inventory and satisfy his clients' demands, which always increases towards the end of the year. He will earn more income with which he will support his family's well-being and continue to invest in his business.

All the children are students. Osuipa has higher education, both she and her husband work at the local school as teachers of physics and mathematics. They both have analytic minds. They have raised more than one generation of school children. \r\n\r\nAs a main income for the family, Osuipa works with livestock breeding, after having started 17 years ago with the purchase of 9,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her persistent work, her farm currently has four dairy cows, four horses and 25 sheep. They have the necessary conditions for breeding livestock. Osuipa at the same time conducts veterinary vaccination as a preventive measure. The whole family helps with the business. They harvest fodder at their own plot of land.

Shadrack lives with his family in a house made of concrete walls, concrete floor and an iron roof.\n\nJitambuni A village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Shadrack and the 10 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nShadrack has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. He volunteered to be the promoter because he is willing to educate the community on safe water. and he wants to help the community by ensuring there is a continuous supply of chlorine that kills bugs in water thus preventing illnesses. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Beatrice, Emily, Faridah and Jane.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

Thanks to his father's dedication to his work as a salesman, as well as the support of his mother, Wilber studied Physical Engineering at the National University of Columbia. He graduated with honors. Wilber's dream is to get his Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering in Europe, but to do so he needs the support of Kiva to help cover the expenses for entrance exams and application fees. Wilber hopes to return to Colombia with his degree, to work on aerospace projects in his country. \r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Although my family supports my dream, my parents are unable to cover the high costs it entails due to our limited financial situation. Currently, I am working as a teacher of algebra, physics and calculus in a local high school. At the same time, I am working with the \"Colombian Astronautics Association\" developing hydraulic rockets with my high school students. The money I am earning will be used to cover my living expenses while I study. For this reason, I need Kiva's help to get over the first hurdle in this long journey of studying abroad. I do not want to give up on this dream, and I know that I will be successful because of my prior academic success and the effort I will put into my future studies. \r\n\r\nThe development of experimental space technologies quickly became one of my biggest passions. I have always been interested in science, and find it very exciting to be part of a world where there is always something new to discover. Stimulating science knowledge in others, especially in children, is one of the reasons why I would like to get my Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering abroad. The challenge of living with another language, in another culture, is one that I would love to take on in order to broaden my horizons. In the future, I wish to create a technology company that will contribute to the development of my country. This is a great opportunity for me to continue my career and increase my professional opportunities.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Jivudavaji\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Jivudavaji, 20 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mable has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

Her husband is also helping her in generating income for their family.\r\n \r\nShe would like to apply for another 60,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAlma hopes that the time will come that she will no longer borrow money and dreams that her children will have a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":286.46,"image":{"id":1485005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory.

She was accepted into the Universidad Salesiana de Bolivia, and now with the chance to achieve her dream, is concerned about affording the cost of her books. She plans on graduating in December 2014, but without a loan from Vittana, she fears that she will need to defer her graduation. \r\n\r\nVicky plans on using her loan to buy her school books. Up until now, she has been managing to get by without them, but it has become a challenge. With books and school supplies, she feels she will be able to get better grades. \r\n\r\nVicky currently works 40 hours a week as a secretary to help afford her school and living expenses.

is a freshman student in the Business Administration Program. Here is his story:\r\n\r\nAt the age of 16 I applied to the Future Leaders Exchange scholarship program. There were a lot of students from my region. It was the hardest competition I have ever faced. Finally, after all tests and interviews, they said that I won scholarship for an exchange program. I was so proud to go as representative of my country to share our cultural values with the people of America. I learned a new culture and this whole new world was opened to me. Everything was new and bizarre. I couldn't understand why people were using two garbage bins. My host mother explained to me that they recycle papers and cans. By recycling them they can reuse those same materials in the future. I wanted to find out more about recycling. Fortunately, my coordinator had a friend who was working in this field. We arranged a meeting. He showed me a factory where they were recycling paper. I was amazed by this place. We had a long conversation about recycling. He said that seventy-five percent of trash can be recycled without any chemicals and harm to the environment. But the main problem was how to manage a factory and efficiently use resources. Because of that I made it my goal to become a manager of recycling business.\r\n\r\nAfter that day I started to think a lot about where I can find this knowledge. I had several ideas about applying to business schools in America but they were unaffordable for me and they were far away from my home country. Then I found out about American University in Central Asia which was one the best universities in whole region. When I was in Bishkek I had always heard about how AUCA students volunteered to help in communities through site cleans-ups, helping orphans, and helping homeless people. I always wanted to be one of them. Educationally, the university's programs were the best in Kyrgyzstan.They could provide me the knowledge which could help me to achieve my future goals. I want to gain experience and knowledge from studying in this university to make my future and the future of my country cleaner."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1485008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She will use the loan to buy clean energy stock such as solar lamps, water filters, and cooking stoves and grow her business.\n\nDjulita sees a huge market for cook stoves and water filters.  She knows that most of the people in Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara province, are still using traditional open fires or kerosene stoves, and are drinking dirty water.  She is keen to educate her customers in the cost-savings and health benefits of these products."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1483960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase clean energy products and resell them in her community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":304,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djulita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-05T22:57:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641879,"name":"Angela Veronica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c1ngela, es madre de cuatro hijos los cuales est\u00e1n estudiando, es soltera de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, por la necesidad de generar ingresos para darles a sus hijos una vida digna, ella desde hace cinco a\u00f1os se dedica a la crianza de cerdos, actividad que desempe\u00f1a todos los d\u00edas y es apoyada por sus hijos, por lo que no se hace una actividad dif\u00edcil de realizar.\nInvertir\u00e1 en la compra de cerdos y alimento para engordarlos, con lo que su negocio ser\u00e1 fortalecido, espera tener mayores ventas y mejores ingresos que le ayuden a ir cancelando las cuotas del pr\u00e9stamo.\nSue\u00f1a con tener un  negocio m\u00e1s grande para dar a sus hijos mejora alimentaci\u00f3n, salud y una educaci\u00f3n superior de calidad.\n","en":"\u00c1ngela is the mother of four children who attend school.

She is married and is raising four children; her husband runs his own business, but lately his income has been lower than expected. This income is not enough to provide for the family. Tojiniso decided to help her husband for the good of the family. With this goal in mind, she enrolled in a course titled \"Achieve Success\", organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and received a certificate.

This is the reason she is seeking a loan to purchase materials like cement, sand, bricks, iron and payment for manual labor to construct a wall next to her home and to install lights in the kitchen so that she and her children can live comfortably and securely. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1505041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase materials like cement, sand, bricks and iron, and to pay for manual labor. \r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-01-04T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":67.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":72.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.58},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":80.44},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":86.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":88.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":93.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":96.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":102.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":92.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-07T14:15:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636416,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is a junior high school graduate.

Ikrom loves his family more than anything and tries his best to provide for them.  As the breadwinner in the family, he is obligated to provide his wife and children with food, education, and medical treatment.\r\n\r\nIkrom is currently working in a passport office in J.Rumy, but would like to start raising livestock to earn some extra money on the side.  He feels he needs to borrow $3000 in addition to what he's already saved in order to get started, which is really not a whole lot of money when you consider how much it costs to buy livestock.  Ikrom understands that it won't be easy to be a successful livestock farmer, but remains undaunted by potential hardships, and will move forward with his plans, come what may.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy bull calves and set up a new livestock-raising business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.Rumy","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ikrom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":221.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":226.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":231},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":236.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":241.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":246.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":252.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":257.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":263.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":269.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":280.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642481,"name":"Eduardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eduardo tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa en el distrito de La Matanza, una comunidad tranquila que se caracteriza por sus bosques de algarrobos, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda a dos horas de la ciudad  de Piura, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nEl se dedica a la venta de ganado vacuno y caprino desde hace cinco a\u00f1o, cuenta con clientela fija en la zona, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 2 000 nuevos soles para la compra de ovejas y una segunda parte para la compra de alimentos balanceados, lo que le permitir\u00e1 tener una mejor producci\u00f3n para ofrecer a sus clientes y de esta manera generar mayores ingresos para su familia.\n\n","en":"Eduardo, 38, lives with his wife in La Matanza district, a tranquil community that is characterized by its carob tree forests.

She first started working as a seamstress at the start of 2010, and, as such, has been at it for more than 3 years.  She works out of her home together with her mother, and specializes in Tajikistani folk apparel for women.  In addition to making women's clothes, she is also studying as a distance-learning student at a university specializing in agriculture, and is paying for her tuition out of pocket.  \r\n\r\nGavhar feels the time is right to start expanding her business.  She is requesting a loan to buy a modern computerized sewing machine, as well as some additional fabrics for sewing.  With the help of this new sewing machine, she'll be able to make more intricate patterns on her dresses.  Naturally, such dresses will command a higher price and allow her to earn more money, bringing her one step closer to realizing her future plans of opening her own sewing

Usually her profits are spent on their electric bills, food expenses, and payments for her loan at the public market. But, due to the lack of capital, she would like a loan of PHP 15,000 to purchase cooking oil, fish sauce, onions, garlic, and soy sauce to sell.
