the past two years, sisters Lupita (right) and Silvia (left) have operated their janitorial company, Smacs Group LLC, with the help of six subcontractors. Specializing in commercial cleaning, including post-construction clean-up, window washing, power washing, and parking lot sweeping, Smacs is the parent company that has another two divisions consisting of office and residential cleaning in San Antonio, Texas. It is also certified by the Small Minority & Women-Owned Business Enterprise Program.\r\n\r\nThough they have a successful business now, the sisters struggled for many years.  Originally from Guanajuato, Mexico, the two came to Texas 23 years ago when their mother decided to remarry.  The original plan was to return to Mexico after obtaining American residency. But that didn\u2019t happen.  For 15 years, Lupita cleaned houses on her own and trained four women to start their own businesses.  (Three of the women are still in business.)  \r\n\r\nIn order to work more effectively with her American (and non-Spanish speaking) clients, she enrolled at San Antonio College to learn English.  When she mastered the language, she switched from doing residential cleaning to post-construction and other commercial clean-up. Together with her sister Silvia, who was the first in her family to graduate from college and has a BBA in business administration from The University of Texas at San Antonio, they created a mission and vision statement and reconstructed the business. \r\n\r\nWith their Accion Texas Inc. loan, the women plan to purchase two or three backpack-type vacuums to make work easier on employees. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to be on their knees. It\u2019ll improve the quality of work and then service. It\u2019s a domino effect,\u201d Silvia said. \u201cWe tell our employees to always remember that we are not in the cleaning business, we\u2019re in the customer service business.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe Accion loan will help the women do more work in a shorter amount of time without compromising the service, Silvia said. Without help, it would have taken the women longer to purchase vacuums, or even begin to research pricing. Silvia said: \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to Accion for giving us a loan. We hope it continues to provide this service to the small business community.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3756.39,"image":{"id":1154820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

During the weekends we teach our children this same art form that has been passed down through many generations. Our children are learning in school that they have opportunities to try other types of work as well, but we would not be surprised if they eventually decide to become rug makers, following the tradition of our ancestors. We are all involved in every aspect of weaving, from washing the raw wool when it arrives at shearing time, to carding it carefully and dyeing it in many beautiful shades before weaving begins. We are especially careful to choose the right colors for each rug \u2013 we put careful consideration into this artistic aspect of the rug-making process.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are very grateful for this help.

This situation becomes worse when the bank closes because she cannot send the little working capitol that she has to the bank to convert it to cash. \r\n\r\nBianca is taking out this loan so that she can increase her working capital and serve more customers.

She has a business there; offering internet and photocopy services, where she generates the income she needs to support her household.  She combines these businesses perfectly with selling a line of ladies\u2019 clothing.  Her business was born though the initiative of a friend, who taught her about communication technology and who sold her previous business after becoming very ill.  She used the money to buy and install computers and began offering this service after recovering her health.\r\n\r\nShe has her own personal daily sales goals that fit into her many desires to grow and increase her income.  During her 10 years of selling fabrics, she was able to build a customer base that she now wants to reestablish by making her customers a tempting offer related to women\u2019s clothing, by offering them credit so that they can make payments they can afford.  Her greatest challenge is not having enough working capital to invest, so for this reason she approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which she will buy computer accessories and in style women\u2019s clothing in quantity.  This investment will allow her to increase her credit sales and little by little she will be able to grow her business and her achieve goals of prosperity, which include seeing her children become prestigious professionals.

She has eight years of experience in this business activity.  She worked in a stationery store, and five years ago she converted her knowledge of the market into her own entrepreneurial adventure.  It is located at her house.  Her sales are strictly for cash.  However, sometimes she takes credit.  She works from 6:00 a.m. until 8:30 p.m. on Monday through Sunday.\r\n\r\nHer painstaking effort is due to wanting to reach her goal of capitalizing her small business through savings.  She wants to do this in order to be able to prosper more each day.  Lorena travels to the city of Barranquilla where she buys merchandise to stock her business.  She does this to impact her customers, who are primarily young people between the ages of 12 and 25.  She sometimes sells to mothers.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, which is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy costume jewelry, variety items, women\u2019s clothes, and perfume.  She wants to add these items to what she sells, keeping in mind that there are a lot of people who request these items.  In turn, they are potential customers, and she has a good commercial place for her sales.\r\n\r\nHer goal for further on is to add communication technology services.  She wants to do this so that everyone in her town is able to access the networks, be up to date, and do their jobs, etc.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan will be successful because her investment is based on the market demand and the purchasing capacity from purchasing in cash.  This will allow her access to good offers from her providers, who also need to sell for cash.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1152629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy costume jewelry, variety items, women\u2019s clothes, and perfume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Juan Nepomuceno-Bolivar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-30T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-29T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":153633},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":168651},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":172586},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":176613},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":180734},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":197783}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.79,"local_amount":153633,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":157583.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775372,"comment":null},{"amount":96.37,"local_amount":168651,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":172987.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387365,"comment":null},{"amount":98.62,"local_amount":172586,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":177023.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994193,"comment":null},{"amount":100.92,"local_amount":176613,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":181154.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130549,"comment":null},{"amount":103.28,"local_amount":180734,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":185381.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519417,"comment":null},{"amount":113.02,"local_amount":197783,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":202868.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071256,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T20:17:02Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454889,"name":"Jose Adolfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, solicita un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para realizar la compra de ganado de repasto, en esta ocasi\u00f3n comprara unos terneros que le permitir\u00e1 a futuro realizar una ganancia, ya que est\u00e1n peque\u00f1os y los crecer\u00e1.\nSu experiencia con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior fue positiva ya que le aument\u00f3 el hato ganadero, se ha mantenido comercializando con sus clientes y al mismo tiempo ha mejorado su situaci\u00f3n en la familia proveyendo mejores ingresos.\n\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is seeking a new loan in order to buy livestock for his farm.

In  2002 he started his own business and worked hard on improving it. \r\n\r\nGhazwan is a hard worker who seeks perfection in his business. He provides internet services to most of his area's citizens since they aren't provided by the government and not all of the people have land line phones, so his business was and still is highly requested in his area. It is the same with the power supply he provides, since electricity is a major problem in the area; this kind of service no one can refuse.\r\n\r\nHe also provides cable television channels with affordable monthly fees, which is a service without which you can't find any house in Lebanon. That's why he has to update all of his electronic spare parts and hardware to make sure that his services are highly appreciated, and this is done through an applied-for loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua.\r\n\r\nGhazwan hopes to keep on expanding and improving his business as much as he can, and to adapt with any new released services.

Unfortunately, and due to the need to work and pay for her expenses, she was not able to graduate from high school but her dream is to do that soon. Jenny dedicates her free time to play with her kids and at times she makes some delicious pallares con carne to share with her family.\r\nOn her own initiative, with a lot of effort and enthusiasm, Jenny started her own business, a grocery shop. Day in and day out, Jenny starts to work very early in the morning. She spends approximately 10 hours a day at her business. She is comfortable doing her job and thinks she does okay since her customers recommend her because of her good prices and kindness.\r\nJenny is very grateful to Kiva loaners because thanks to their help she will be able to build a fence around her house with appropriate materials such as brick and concrete. She will also be able to put on a corrugated roof. Thus, Jenny will be able to have a more appropriate and safe house, providing the necessary conditions for the welfare and better development of her children. With this, Jenny aspires to completely finish the construction of her house in a not very distant future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1152986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

La ciudad es tambi\u00e9n conocida por su producci\u00f3n de frutas. \n\nEl grupo Virgen del Cisne est\u00e1 compuesto por 4 integrantes que basadas en una fuerte y buena relaci\u00f3n crearon un negocio de comercio de ropa, frutas, y comida preparada. Mayra tiene 26 a\u00f1os, tan solo logr\u00f3 completar sus estudios primarios, pero aun no empieza su familia por lo tanto puede dedicar sus energ\u00edas al oficio. Maria Eugenia tiene 61 a\u00f1os de edad, tampoco tiene ning\u00fan compromiso, por lo tanto invierte su tiempo y experiencia en su oficio de comerciante. Zoila Hercilia tiene 47 a\u00f1os. Es madre soltera de un hijo al que tiene que mantener, por lo tanto trabaja duro para que el negocio salga adelante. A sus 54 a\u00f1os, Antonia de Jes\u00fas tambi\u00e9n es madre soltera de 2 hijos. A pesar de que ella no pudo continuar sus estudios secundarios ni superiores, Antonia sue\u00f1a que sus hijos lo logran. Por lo tanto, quiere que el grupo de Virgen del Cisne prospere y pueda incrementar sus ingresos. \n\nAunque las ganas no faltan, es complicado para las cuatro mujeres emprendedoras incrementar los ingresos del negocio por la falta de capital. Es por esto que solicitan un cr\u00e9dito a Kiva para poder comprar m\u00e1s ropa y frutas para disminuir el precio unitario, sillas y mesa para que los clientes se sientan m\u00e1s c\u00f3modos, y para hacer otros arreglos necesarios. Con este pr\u00e9stamo, ellas tienen fe en que su negocio va a ser m\u00e1s pr\u00f3spero y poder brindarles una mejor calidad de vida para ellas mismas y sus familiares.\n","en":"Mayra, Maria Eugenia, Hercilia and Antonia make up the communal bank \"Virgen del Cisne.\"  The four women live in Santo Domingo de Los Ts\u00e1chilas, a city located between the coast and the Ecuadorian mountains.  This city links the various Ecuadorian cities, making Santo Domingo a crucial point for Ecuadorian commerce.  What's more, the city handles most of the livestock trade in the country.  Its climate is humid and tropical; the temperature varies from 18 to 32 degrees centigrade.  Santo Domingo is home to the Ts\u00e1chilas, an ethnic group that existed from before the colonial era.  This city is also known for its production of fruit.\r\n\r\nThe group \"Virgen del Cisne\" is made up of 4 members who, based on a strong and good relationship, created their own businesses selling clothing, fruit and prepared meals.  Mayra, 26, only completed elementary school.  She has not yet started a family, because she wants to devote her energy to her business.  Maria Eugenia, 61, is also single, and she invests her time and experience in her business as a merchant.  Zoila Hercilia is 47 years old.  She is the single mother of a son who she has to support.  To do this, she works very hard to get ahead with her business.  Antonia de Jesus, 54, is also a single mother and has 2 children.  Even though she was not able to complete her high school education or go to college, Antonia dreams that her children will achieve this.  Therefore, she wants the \"Virgen del Cisne\" group to prosper and the members to increase their earnings. \r\n\r\nAlthough they are strongly motivated, it's difficult for these four enterprising women to increase their income because they lack capital.  For this reason, they are requesting a Kiva loan so that they can buy more clothing and fruit in bulk to reduce the unit price, a table and chairs so that their customers will feel more comfortable, and to make other needed repairs.  With this loan, they have faith that their businesses are going to be more profitable so that they can provide a better quality of life for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1151815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing and other merchandise to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-07-31T02:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-30T02:40:01Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoila Hercilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonio De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2285.22,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":362.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":373.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":379.43},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":383.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":390.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":395.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":364.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":381.88},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":393.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":398.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":364.87,"local_amount":362.53,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":364.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390511,"comment":null},{"amount":375.66,"local_amount":373.24,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":375.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149507,"comment":null},{"amount":381.88,"local_amount":379.43,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":381.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382629,"comment":null},{"amount":385.63,"local_amount":383.15,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":385.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989717,"comment":null},{"amount":393.51,"local_amount":390.98,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":393.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126123,"comment":null},{"amount":398.45,"local_amount":395.89,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":398.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-20T23:08:01Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454938,"name":"Felix Difunto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Felix es un hombre de 44 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Nazca con su pareja y su hijo, \u00e9l es una persona muy amable, trabajar y entusiasta, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por sacar adelante a su familia;

Chanda lives with her family in a rural village in the Thmor Koul district of Battambang province, Cambodia. She is a midwife and supplements her family\u2019s income by selling medicines in the local area. Having been in this business for more than 20 years, she earns about 32,000 KHR per day to meet her family's needs.\r\n\r\nChanda\u2019s group consists of two members who have both been with VisionFund for five cycles.

Rashidah is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda. She is single and has one child who is currently in school. For the past year, Rashidah has been working hard to manage her retail shop, where she sells milk and charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rashidah has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more charcoal to sell, and will help Rashidah to generate greater profits and buy more milk and a refrigerator. She hopes that in the future she will be able to enlarge her business. \r\n\r\nRashidah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Winnie is 21 years old, is single and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda. For the past four years, Winnie has been working hard to manage her retail shop where she sells sugar, beans, rice and salt. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Winnie has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a refrigerator and will help Winnie to generate greater profits and buy a plot of land. She hopes that in the future she will be able to build her own house and buy a car. \r\n\r\nWinnie is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

is 17 years old, is single and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda. For the past two years, Sandrah has been working hard to manage her salon where she styles and plaits hair. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sandrah has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a hairdryer and cosmetics, and will help Sandrah to generate greater profits and grow her business by acquiring assets. Sandrah hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and have a shop from which to sell spare parts. \r\n\r\nSandrah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past year, Teopista has been working hard to manage her farm which grows vegetables like cabbage and eggplant. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Teopista has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more seeds for her farm, and will help Teopista to generate greater profits and allow her to finish her home. She hopes that in the future she will be able to buy another plot of land for farming. \r\n\r\nTeopista is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Through my tertiary education, I have wanted to grow a business and affect my world positively. I have worked with two banks previously in the retail, marketing and sales aspects and have developed great business skills such as direct marketing. I am where I am today because I have been opening my heart to new challenges and opportunities.\r\n\r\nMy business deals in the receiving and sending of money countrywide.  I feel it is a service that impacts positively in my city because it is accommodating to people from all walks of life. Anyone can walk into my shop and be comfortable to transact business with me. \r\n\r\nOn a daily basis, I have over three hundred people come to my shop to send and receive money. However, I only serve about a hundred and fifty of them. This is because I do not have enough working capital to satisfy them all. The situation worsens when it is the end of the month, as that is the time of the month when most people in Lusaka get paid. I tend to have even more people come to transact money transfers. It is for this reason that I am taking out a loan. This loan will have a very big impact on my business because I will be able to serve all my customers and this will stimulate my revenue.\r\n\r\nGetting this loan will also change my personal life. I will earn more profits and this will help me to finally move out of my parents' house and fulfill my responsibilities of helping out my family members. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4975,"image":{"id":1154878,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2683,"youtubeId":"YRXCMJTfeH4","title":null,"thumbnailImageId":1154878},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To increase his working capital so that he does not have to send away half of his customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-07-31T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-30T13:40:04Z","loan_amount":4975,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":24300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":4975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":24300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":540.05,"local_amount":2637813,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2640825.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533421,"comment":null},{"amount":383.41,"local_amount":1872750,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1874888.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323132521,"comment":null},{"amount":344.45,"local_amount":1682437,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-26T09:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1684358.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281415,"comment":null},{"amount":3707.09,"local_amount":18107000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-22T10:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":18127677.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339657054,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-13T23:13:13Z","paid_date":"2013-02-22T10:00:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":456511,"name":"Phan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phan, 44 years old, is originally from the Sangke district of Battambang Province, Cambodia.

He used to work as a military man for many years. Now he runs a taxi for the extra earnings for his family. He lives with his wife and his daughter; most of his children have moved out from their parent\u2019s home. \r\n\r\nHis family owns an old house in the ger district (a ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt) of Kherlen town, an eastern town in Mongolia. Lately his house has been in bad repair and he can\u2019t always make any big repairs to his house due to the money shortage. Especially, some parts of his house roof have been broken by wind and rains in the past. This creates heat loss and it costs much to buy the coal to warm his home in winter. In Mongolia, winter is very cold and harsh; most Mongolians use coal to warm their home because there is little forest and wood sources. \r\n\r\nTsedenbal knows that using the coal fuel is very harmful to the health of people and the environment, so he decided to repair his roof within this summer. He needs about MNT 500,000 to buy the building materials for his house roof repair. His son will support him in repairing it.

She has one daughter and one son who are still in school.\r\n\r\nSovann has upgraded her family's living conditions with income from rice farming as her main source of income, with a huge labor support from her husband. She supplements her income by selling sweets. Nonetheless, the low crop yield remains a huge challenge for her.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan cycle for Sovann with Kiva partner VisionFund. She has managed the past four loans with success in keeping all of her children in school and in leasing an additional plot for growing more paddy rice.

She buys fabric that she transforms with the aim to make sheets. Her business runs quite well. Thanks to her experience in sewing she has been able to win a significant number of customers. However, the fact that she only sells sheets is a problem because her customers are asking for more and more other bedding items such as pillowcases and others. She is not able to meet their demand because her small working capital does not allow her to allocate a portion to the making of different bedding items. She cannot properly meet her customers\u2019 demand.\r\n\r\nShe would like this loan to buy large quantities of fabric that will help her to make other bedding items. This will allow her to meet her customers\u2019 demand and increase her profit. The profit will help her grow her business by buying more fabric in order to make more bedding items, but also to meet her family\u2019s needs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1157009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase fabric.

actividad de comercio ambulante, principalmente con venta de articulos de cat\u00e1logo, cosm\u00e9ticos y zapatos, mediante el sistema de cr\u00e9dito.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo se utilizara para reforzar el capital de trabajo,especificamente se destinara a la compara de articulos de cat\u00e1logo, cosmeticos y articulos para el hogar, que es una linea nueva, que tiene muy buena venta. \nUna de las razones por lo que Juana, acude a Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, es que los proveedores de estos articulos de cat\u00e1logo, ofrecen un cr\u00e9dito a 30 d\u00edas, por lo que tenia que pedir una parte del valor del articulo cuando realizaba la venta y la otra contra entrega de la mercader\u00eda, lo que hacia que muchas personas no pudieran adquirir sus productos, con el cr\u00e9dito pudo ofrecer un plazo mas largo y esto hizo que aumentara su cartera de clientes, ya que podia ofrecer un cr\u00e9dito mas acorde a las capacidad de pago de sus clientas.\nDentro de su planes futuros esta el poder

larger amount so she could develop her commercial activity.  She lives in Puntarenas Province in Corredor District, Ciudad Nelly Sector.  She\u2019s been a merchant for the last ten years mainly selling catalogue items like cosmetics and shoes on credit.  She will use the loan to strengthen her working capital.  Specifically, she\u2019ll use it to buy catalogue items like cosmetics and articles for the home which is a new line that sells well.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why Juana is calling on Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer is that the suppliers of these catalogue items only offer 30 days\u2019 credit which meant she had to collect part of the price of the item when she sold it and the other part when she delivered it which in turn meant that many people couldn\u2019t afford to buy her products.  With the loan she was able to offer a longer payment plan which led to increased number of customers since she could now offer credit more in line with her customers\u2019 ability to pay.\r\n\r\nWithin her future plans is to be able to support her daughter in the development of her productive activity: crafts production of all-occasion (wedding, birthday, etc.) greeting cards as well as making artisanal costume jewelry with beads and seeds that are well-received by the public since her daughter has decided to be an independent worker just like her

He is a hardworking and goal-oriented person.  Namozkul works as a tractor driver at a dekhan farm.  He makes a good profit, but this money is still not enough to provide for the family because he is the sole income earner in the family.  His children are getting older, and it will be necessary to marry them off.  Therefore, Namozkul decided to get involved in animal husbandry during his time free from work.  He is requesting this loan to buy bulls and calves for subsequent resale.  Today, Namozkul has one dairy cow that provides the family with milk and dairy products.
