The city, along with other cities close to the Pacific coast, was damaged in 2001 and 2007, years of strong earthquakes, but it has endured as it always has during the better part of its history.\r\n\r\nIn her spare time she likes to watch her soap operas.  It is well known that Peru is known for having the most delicious food in the world, and one of the dishes Fiorella likes a lot is \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" [dried potatoes with meat and sauce served with pasta].  Fiorella is the mother of a five-year-old child who is in the first year of school.\r\n\t\t\r\nFiorella works selling snow cones, \"papa rellena\" [stuffed potatoes], and \"salchipollo\" [fried potatoes with chicken].  She works at this job about nine hours a day.  In one day she is able to serve up to 25 customers.  She believes that it is going well for her in her business because she treats her customers well.\r\n\r\nFiorella is very grateful to the lenders because with their help she will be able to buy utensils for preparing her dishes and an electric snow-cone machine.  With this improvement she will be able to serve her customers faster and have the necessary tools, and so continue working to realize her big dream: \"To give her son a career and to grow as a micro-entrepreneur.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1007695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy utensils and an electric snow-cone machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T03:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T03:40:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fiorella Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":152.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":163.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":169.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":176.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":182.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.03,"local_amount":152.08,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":153.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993978,"comment":null},{"amount":58.76,"local_amount":156.7,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":157.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601876,"comment":null},{"amount":18.86,"local_amount":50.3,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":50.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090999,"comment":null},{"amount":105.91,"local_amount":282.42,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":284.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222069,"comment":null},{"amount":66.04,"local_amount":176.09,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298146,"comment":null},{"amount":68.4,"local_amount":182.41,"processed_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":183.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301350915,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T20:48:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:24:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397097,"name":"Jackqueline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackqueline   is 25 years old and lives in Buchanan.

He is married with 2 children aged 4 and 12 years.\r\n\r\nIdrissa runs a Pharmacy at Wilberforce village. He sells paracetamol tabs, malarial drugs, baby food, procaine injections (Novocain: type of anesthesia) and blood tonic. He has been running this business for 15 years. He began his business because he needed a permanent source of income to take care of his family. He works in the business 7 days per week and 18 hours a day. He also earns income from the patients he treats.

She began her business because she wants to be independent and to take care of her family. Working seven days a week and twelve hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,700,000 every month from this business. \n\nShe would like a loan of SLL 5,000,000. Marie has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to increase her stock. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 350,000.

is 50 years old. She lives in a small village in South Georgia with her family: her husband Spartak and two daughters (30 and 27 years old). Laura\u2019s husband has health problems and he receives a relevant pension from the government. \r\n\r\nLaura is leading the agricultural business of the family. She grows haricot and potatoes on a family-owned plot of the land. Her daughters assist her. In addition, the family owns a small dairy farm with two milk cows. Laura produces traditional Georgian cheese. She sells cheese and harvested vegetables at the local market.

is 23 years old. She is the third born in a family of six. She is a single mother of one and currently lives in a small town called Katete located in the eastern part of Zambia. She runs her mobile money transfers business and she struggles to do her daily transactions because of low working capital. \r\n\r\nMartha has had to support herself ever since she was a child. At the young age of nine she had to start selling vegetables to help her mother raise money for food and school fees. She took everything she learned from her days of selling vegetables and opened her own hair salon as soon as she completed high school. She ran the salon for six months but had to close it down because she was not making any profit. She then started selling chickens and it was through running this business and interacting with different people that she learned about an organization that conducts HIV\/AIDS training. She underwent the training and became a qualified HIV\/AIDS care giver. In April 2011, while still working as a care giver, she got an opportunity to start running her own mobile money transfer business and took it. \r\n\r\nHaving run her mobile money transfer business for close to 10 months now, she says she loves it because it gives her an opportunity to interact with different people and she gets to learn new things every day. She believes her community benefits from her business because they are able to send money in a quicker and safer way. \r\n\r\nCurrently Martha only has working capital of $200, which is not enough to serve customers who want to send larger amounts of money and so she has no choice but to send them away. Martha is in dire need of this loan so that she can increase her working capital. She is confident this will give her more customers and more commission. \r\n\r\nIn her video, Martha is being interviewed by a representative from mobile transactions.

is a 26-year-old man who is always kind-hearted in his everyday life, according to the residents of his neighborhood. He got married and has two children. The burden of supporting his family is becoming heavier than ever, as he needs to cover his children's expenses in terms of living, education, and other things required by a big family. \r\n\r\nFuad started his business long ago in order to cover the expenses imposed by his big family. His business was initially decorating shop windows that didn't require a large amount of capital except to purchase white cement and equipment for adornment and carving of windows. This business achieved a good reputation in old Sana'a, where it is located, and many people became regular customers. \r\n\r\nFuad's family life was somewhat improved by the limited income from that business, but he did not stop at this point. He had some thoughts about further enlarging his business by opening a cafe next to this business selling food to his clients, a commonly sold food eaten as breakfast. \r\n\r\nFuad was in need of a loan to start up the other business and visited one of Al-Amal Bank's branches. He  took a youth loan of 100,000 YER from AMB in order to pay the rent for the two shops and purchase needed materials like a large amount of white cement. In the future, he hopes to expand his business by opening a restaurant selling all types of food. He also hopes to build a house for his family and especially his children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1013643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":" to pay the rent for the two shops and purchase needed materials like a large amount of white cement for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T15:10:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fuad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276563377,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050522,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072063,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294266934,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301320272,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308341206,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:04:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310565,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918899,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331051170,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:30:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339441198,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T19:50:21Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T13:30:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396490,"name":"Taisyr","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taisyr is 30 years old, a married man with two children who lives in Taiz, Yemen with his loving family.

His daughters-in-law will start selling milk and dairy products in spring. Abdusalom got another loan to increase the number of livestock. The loans that he receives help Abdusalom purchase the livestock. He sells goats and sheep when market prices are high, and therefore makes a good profit.

He has a young family and, hence, has to earn well in order to provide not only for his wife, but to help his retired parents.  This is why, his father and he are involved in breeding goats.

receive loans from Kiva through the MFI HOPE RDC with the goal of developing their businesses. \r\n\r\nJulienne has been in business for years. She sells fresh food at the market located north-east of the city of Kinshasa. She is a loyal client of the MFI HOPE RDC who has already received seven different loans and has repaid them properly. As the fresh food demand is high in her community, she intends to use the next loan to increase her stock of fresh food, reselling it with the aim of increasing her profits.

Now her customers know her for the tasty dishes that she makes.  She also plants corn from Cuzco on her agricultural land.  This season she only used one parcel because she rented the other land for a good price.  Currently she hopes to obtain a good harvest, since she has worked hard caring for the crop.  Now she wants to increase her livestock, since recently she sold an average of 300 guinea pigs and for next season she needs to stock up on her livestock for sale.
