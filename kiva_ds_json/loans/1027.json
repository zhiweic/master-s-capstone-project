lives in a little rural village in northern Albania. She is in her 60s and has four children. She was a school teacher until she retired, after which she started a completely new activity: producing corn, wheat and oats and selling these products to flour factories. This activity has turned out to be very profitable because the flour is used to make bread and Albanians are good consumers of bread. Note that bread with a bit of dairy is a staple for poor Albanian families. \r\n\r\nNot only is Bardhe happy with the income she has earned from this activity; she is also enjoying the whole process from plowing the soil to watering, planting and harvesting.\r\n\r\nBardhe needs a loan to drain land that has been flooded by heavy rains in the past few months. She requests 100,000 Albanian lek and said that she would be very grateful if she was offered some financial help from Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":661.2,"image":{"id":1254847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Her husband is working on a power loom but his income is not sufficient to run the household alone so she is contentedly doing it for the sake of her family and contributes enough to the family income.

With the investment, he will be able to buy merchandise in large quantities and avoid having to travel so often. He will also save money by purchasing the pig feed at wholesale. He will be able to feed them well and sell them in a short time, when they are developed.\r\n\r\nHis desire is to improve his quality of life, to provide for his family and their health, education, clothing, and food. As his business improves, he will be able to achieve this.

is 32-year-old Gibrilla.  He is married and has two children who are eight and five years old. In 2001, Gibrilla established his clothing and traveling box business. He began his business because he wanted to engage himself in economic activities to avoid being idle. His business is located in the heart of town and his main customers are both men and women but mostly women. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about Le 620,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan of Le 4,500,000. Gibrilla has already received and successfully repaid two loans and now requires a new loan to buy jeans trousers ,  a traveling box  and Polo shirts. He hopes that this loan will empower him to solve his domestic problems. In the future, Gibrilla plans to establish a boutique, to complete the construction of his house and to educate his kids.
