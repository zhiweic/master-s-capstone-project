Her little one is 5 months old and she loves him dearly.  He gives her the strength she needs to make progress and he is her best source of motivation.  Ysabel tells us that whenever she is sad or worried for any reason, just seeing her baby's face makes her forget everything and she is able to draw on hidden reserves of strength so that she can keep going and keep making progress.  Isabel's home is located in the city of Chincha.  This city is known as the birthplace of some of Peru's sporting legends.  It is also well known because its residents have a great talent for preparing very flavorful food.  Like all good Peruvians, Isabel really enjoys Peruvian cuisine.  One of her favorite dishes is the delicious fried fish with beans.  Owing to her family's limited economic means, Isabel was only able to study up to the fifth year of her secondary education.  She would have liked to have studied Business Management.\r\n\r\nIsabel worked hard and managed to set up a business selling clothing.  She works around 10 hours a day and can serve up to 15 customers a day.  She believes that her business is doing well because she is charming and kind to her customers.\r\n\r\nIsabel is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to the help that they provide, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business.

All of them live in the town of San Bernardo. Lorena is the president of this communal bank: in the picture, she is on the second row from the top, fourth person from the right, with short blond hair, wearing a white shirt and with her arm around one of the other women. She has been selling Hindu-like clothing as well as handbags for 5 years. She has a permit that allows her to sell products from a stand she sets up at an artisans' fair. She works all day every day, including week-ends and bank holidays. Her customer base is loyal and has been with her since she started her business. She buys her merchandise from several suppliers, depending on which offers the best prices. With this loan, she will buy merchandise to supply her stand. Lorena lives with her three children, aged 29, 27, and 20, who work and study. One of her personal dreams is to renovate her house and offer her grandchildren a better quality of life, particularly when it comes to education. She is very happy and thankful for the opportunity afforded her by Fondo Esperanza, since its support has been crucial for her business. She says that the communal bank group of which she is a member is very tightly knit. Thanks to the information imparted during meetings, she was able to learn new accounting and investing strategies for her business. San Bernardo is a town located 18 km to the south of Santiago's (the capital of Chile) main square in a straight line. It is known as the capital of folklore, since every year in January it hosts the International Folklore Festival, an event which showcases the country's roots and attracts musical ensembles from all over South America. The Traditional Artisans' Fair, also in January, draws Chilean and neighbouring countries' artisans to the town. In April, the town hosts the \"Abril cuecas Mil\" (\"A thousand cuecas in April\") festival, during which all the locals dance cuecas (a traditional Chilean dance).\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1070591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Sanu has already received and successfully repaid 6 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buys a young milk cow.  In the future, Sanu plans to uplift the economic conditions of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

Zikrullo previously worked at a financial organization, but because that salary was not sufficient for living, he left that work, learned repair work and has been involved in this business for over a year.

in Hawaii, Veronica, 41, wanted to bring the relaxed feel of the island to her hometown of San Antonio by opening the hair salon, Hair in Paradise. \"I don\u2019t like the everyday-type salons,\u201d Veronica said. What sets her salon apart, she said, is her hospitality.\n\nBy the age of 17, Veronica decided to get into the cosmetology industry. Shortly afterwards, she studied cosmetology in Hawaii. She studied cosmetology again when she returned to San Antonio in 2002. She has 23 years of hair styling experience and opened her business in 2005.\n\n\u201cBecoming an entrepreneur is something that I always wanted to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked in places where it\u2019s been a lot of chaos. When you get women together, you get a lot of opinions. I wanted to have my own place to give customer service my way. I listen to the customers and give them what they ask for.\u201d\n\nThis initiated Veronica\u2019s new loan with ACCION Texas Inc. She plans to use it to purchase items from Hawaii to resell within the shop, as requested by her clientele, and to improve its Hawaiian paradise feel. Veronica also plans to update her shop with new paint and repair minor problems.\n\nContinuing about her love for the industry, Veronica said, \u201cI like working with hair and am comfortable with making people feel good about themselves.\u201d She said,  \u201cIf your hair looks good, you feel good. It\u2019s gratifying to me to know I can do that.\u201d\n\nAt Hair in Paradise, Veronica employs two other people: one receptionist and one stylist. As her business grows, Veronica plans to hire more employees. \n\nVeronica said the loan will help her business grow and allow her salon \u201cto be more inviting to my customers and make them feel more relaxed.\u201d\n\nA returning ACCION client, Veronica said previous loans affected her business positively. \u201cACCION is a good company,\u201d she said. \u201cThe loan officers I worked with seemed interested in what I wanted to do. I felt comfortable with them.\u201d \n\nThose previous loans allowed her to make her salon more comfortable, have the necessities needed to build the shop and make it stronger. \n\nFind Veronica on

She spends about 10 hours daily in her business and can tend to up to 20 customers per day, especially children who are the ones that most buy her products.  She believes that she does well in business because she has a lot of patience with the children and above all because she is very kind and prepares delicious desserts.\r\n\r\nLuz is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they have given her she will be able to buy an industrial mixer and cake molds because she currently does not have these tools.  With this improvement she will have adequate materials to make her desserts thus improving her income so she can continue striving daily toward her great dream: \u201cTo have a large pastry

She is married to Vilardo, a vendor, and is a mother to their three children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSalvacion operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them with a little profit. Her products are children\u2019s clothes, RTW (a clothing brand), and other similar products.\r\n\r\nCustomers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 900 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy RTW products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSalvacion hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She is the mother of 6 children, all of whom are grown.  But her 23-year old daughter lives with her, is always by her side and helps her with everything.  Ysabel has had difficult time throughout her life.  She was married at 16 and was widowed.  After a time, she married again, but her new partner left her.  She raised her children by herself and put forth a lot of effort to get them ahead.  Ysabel's 94-year old mother also lives with her.  Ysabel loves her very much and takes care of her.  In spite of her age, Ysabel's mother works in the fields.  She is an example that age is not an impediment to working and feeling useful.  Ysabel's home is in Imperial, a city known for its beautiful beaches, its warm climate, its agriculture and above all, the friendliness of its people.\r\n\r\nYsabel learned as a young girl helping her mother to \"earn her bread by the sweat of her brow.\"  Because of that, Ysabel made the decision to have a business selling flowers, which is her current work.  She was excited about it, since her mother taught her to arrange the flowers.  She has now been in the business 15 years.  Ysabel is very friendly with her customers, and that is why they seek her out and purchase her products.  Ysabel believes that that is why her business is going well for her.\r\n\r\nYsabel is quite grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the help they have offered, she will be able to purchase more flowers for her business.  This is especially important because Mother's Day is approaching, and she always has orders to fill.  Now Ysabel will improve her income and be able to keep working toward making her greatest dream a reality, \"to have a big flower shop and to buy herself a car.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1070979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase

is Marlyn, 56, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is a widow and the mother of three children. She and her children manage their household while operating the business. Marlyn works hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMarlyn operates a variety store which, in the Philippines, is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Nenita earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Marlyn earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Marlyn is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarlyn hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLeona operates a meat stall. They buy meat from suppliers that deliver meat to market stalls. Her products are pork, beef meat and processed meat products. There are many patrons who prefer her products since they are assured of freshness and cleanliness. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy additional supplies of pork and beef meat needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLeona hopes that her business will continue to be successful, just as she fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day and be finished with their studies. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.

is 62 years old. He lives in Kvareli District, East Georgia with his wife, Manya, and his 4-year-old grandson. Manya is retired. Zaur is busy with agriculture. The family owns a small vineyard. Zaur produces wine and sells it in the village. The family's total average monthly income, including Manya\u2019s pension, is 200 Laris. This places the family in the category of the vulnerable poor according to Credo estimations. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nZaur used to run a family farming business. In particular, he used to grow melons on a family-owned plot of land. Five years ago, he had to stop this business, because he didn\u2019t have the financial resources to cover seasonal agricultural needs. Now his loan request has been approved in a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides start-up and re-startup funding with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products due to their \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d classification, which is because of their low income. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith this received credit, Zaur will rent a tractor to cultivate the land, purchase seeds of melons, and purchase fertilizers. He will seed the melons and work hard on the plot during the spring season. After properly done seasonal work, Zaur will get a good harvest in summer. He will sell harvested products to local retailers. The income of the family will increase. Zaur plans to save some funds for sowing more melons next year. The living conditions of the family will improve, providing the family with enough income to access regular credit products available within the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1074267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to rent a tractor for land cultivation, purchase melon seeds, and purchase fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kuchatani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-04-24T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-24T07:20:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":51.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283194641,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":51.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287358298,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294394492,"comment":null},{"amount":656.25,"local_amount":1050,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1072.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440302,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-03T20:10:41Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:25:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":417528,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente, membre d\u2019une association de cr\u00e9dit, jeune femme  courageuse, entrepreneur, divorc\u00e9,\u00e2g\u00e9e de 31 ans.

She finances a group of small fishermen who go out to sea by providing food, fuel, ice and other items they need. Sometimes she may even advance cash to her suppliers. Once the boats come in, the catch is sorted, weighed and packed into ice boxes for shipment to Manila. Mary Jane and the fishermen then square their accounts and the cycle starts anew. Mary Jane ships around 12 50-kilo boxes of fish weekly. She earns about Php700 daily.\r\n\t\r\nMary Jane needs Php 40,000 as additional capital to be able to cope with the ebb and flow of the fish business. It will be used to purchase additional fish and ice as well as for operational expenses like the bills for shipping and wages for those who repack and handle the fish.\r\n\r\nOn the personal side, Mary Jane finds it hard to cope with some family problems. But it is her three children who give her the determination to succeed. She dreams that one day they will all graduate from college, surpassing her, for she only managed to finish her secondary studies. Mary Jane is an active community partner of C.C.T. She meets with her fellowship* group every Wednesday.\r\n\r\n*All C.C.T. community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Recuerdos (Memories), is made of five hard-working, friendly, and happy women.  All of the members of this group are natives of Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca.  For them, their community means land of good and hard-working people.  One of the traditions of Pinotepa Nacional is the celebration of Day of the Dead and the Fiesta Quinto Viernes when the games arrive and many foreigners come to sell their crafts.  \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Maria, 58 years old, who is known for being a happy, humble, and very friendly woman.  Do\u00f1a Mari, as she is better known by her partners in the group, makes a living selling footwear from a catalog.  She sells footwear for boys, girls, men, and women.  She tells us that what she likes most about her business is going out and selling in the streets of her community so that she can get more profits.  What she doesn't like about her business is that sometimes her customers are slow to pay her, and this is where she loses customers and falls behind in ordering her goods.  \r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to have a small place where she can exhibit her goods and be able to meet her clients.  Do\u00f1a Mari tells us one of her challenges, which at times makes it difficult to continue with her business, is that sometimes she runs out of money for ordering more goods and her customers get upset because the footwear does not arrive on time. This makes her feel sad since they do not understand that she needs money in order to invest and to have extra footwear so that if one of her customers likes a shoe and she is able to get it the customer would go away happy since they have two shoes to choose from.  Do\u00f1a Mari says that she also makes a living selling American perfumes because her son orders perfumes so that she can sell them and thus have extra money.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Mari is happily married to Se\u00f1or Cirio with whom she has five children who are already married.  Her children are named Daniel, Fidel, Fabiola, Isirino, and Jorge.  They love their mother very much and help her in whatever way they are able.  She asked for the loan so that she can buy more footwear for women, boys, girls, and men.  She tells us that she gives thanks to the Foundation for giving her the opportunity to get ahead and thus improve her quality of life and increase her business.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nEva Felicisima - Makes a living selling footwear.\r\nConsuelo - Makes a living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nMarcelina - Makes a living selling footwear.\r\nMargarita - Makes a living selling perfumes.\r\n\r\nThey give thanks to the Foundation for helping the good and hard-working people with their wishes to improve their lives and have a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":1069611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy footwear to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-24T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-24T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva  Felicisima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuelo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7311.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7599.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8001.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":8344.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8743.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":557.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":610.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":636.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":788.5,"local_amount":10341,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10418.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317533,"comment":null},{"amount":610.61,"local_amount":8008.05,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":8068.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418918,"comment":null},{"amount":347.93,"local_amount":4563,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4597.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568494,"comment":null},{"amount":665.66,"local_amount":8729.92,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-27T08:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":8795.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399804,"comment":null},{"amount":392.84,"local_amount":5152,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5190.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407538,"comment":null},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":503.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392218,"comment":null},{"amount":40.87,"local_amount":536,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":540.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120130,"comment":null},{"amount":41.17,"local_amount":540,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":544.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284979,"comment":null},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":503.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596122,"comment":null},{"amount":86.18,"local_amount":1130.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840212,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-22T15:43:29Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:32:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":417004,"name":"Allen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allen, a 34-year-old married mother of five children, lives in Kasese, Uganda where she has been in the bar and lodging business for seven years.

is Arlyn, 31, a resident of Puerto Princesa, Palawan, Philippines. She is married to Abner, her business partner, and is the mother of their four children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.    \r\n                         \r\nArlyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located near the main street. Her regular customers are neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe also operates a fishing boat for additional income. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages and for the maintenance of their boat. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArlyn hopes to grow her business and acquire another vehicle. She dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1074847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Once a week, Erna buys the merchandise she needs in bulk from distributors.  Her loan will be used to buy winter clothing, especially track suits and athletic shoes.  In addition, she will purchase fleece for making garments.  One of her goals is to have an established shop.\r\n<p>\r\nErna lives with her husband and two children, ages 24 and 18, who are in school.  One of her dreams for her family is to see her children become professionals.  She would also like to have a home of her own.  Erna is very pleased and grateful for the financial opportunity provided by Fondo Esperanza to invest in her business.  She also enjoys the Communal Bank meetings with her group because the members are close and responsible.  \r\n<p>\r\nSan Bernardo is a city that is located 18 kilometers due south from the Plaza de Armas in Santiago (the Chilean capital).  It is known as the folklore capital since  the International Folklore Festival is held there every January.  This event highlights the various ethnic groups of the country and musical groups from all over South America gather there.  Chilean artisans, as well as those from other countries nearby, also participate in the Traditional Craft Fair.  In the month of April, an event called \"Abril Cuecas Mil\" celebrates the \"cueca\" (a traditional Chilean dance) throughout the entire community.

In order to further develop her business, Uulkan requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows, which would allow her to increase milk volumes, and to spend some on farming expenses.
