To provide daily decent food for her children, she needs to make a living through crop planting on 1 hectare of farmland (paddy rice) and a 3-hectare area (cassava). \r\n\r\nShe has been with this business for 17 years and is challenged with the dwindling price of cassava. \r\n\r\nSam Eean's group consists of two members; both are females and first-loan borrowers.

He started this activity since he wanted to do something different from other people. He did this, because he wanted to have less competition. He does the work alone, starting very early and working until mid day, since it is hard work and he finishes tired. His wife helps him financially since she sells beauty products from a catalogue, while their child attends public school. His work is paid by the block, and if it is harmed during transport, it becomes an expense, so one has to be careful.

Four years ago he decided to open his own shop because he enjoys the work and the most important thing for him is to be independent. He works together with an assistant from 8 o'clock int the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening. Because the shop is still rather new, he needs to acquire tools to improve his service. This is how he will use the loan for which he has applied.

old, married, and raising 3 children. She works as a teacher at a local school. Furthermore, as a source of additional income for her family, Jipar has been growing crops and raising livestock for the past 13 years, having started her business with 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Jipar's herd presently includes 2 cows with offspring, 10 goats and sheep, and 2 horses, while her monthly profits amount to roughly 4,000 som (KGS). Additionally, Jipar works 3.4 hectares of land with barley, potatoes and perennial grasses.\r\n\r\nAs the fall season is particularly active in agriculture, Jipar, like many other countryside residents, needs financial support in order to develop her business. In light of this, she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase mares for fattening at a summer pasture. Jipar intends to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business, and also plans to hold her son's wedding next year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1176460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She has three additional dependents, who live with her to help with the household chores.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Hawa established her provisions, drinks, toiletries, and textiles business. The business started to help her husband manage the family's affairs. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about SLL 2,051,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan of SLL 3,000,000.

A pesar de que cuida una gran cantidad de ni\u00f1os, Luz Mar\u00eda realiza una labor casi social con los habitantes del sector, por lo que no cuenta con un gran capital disponible; es por esto que busca un pr\u00e9stamo para reparar el techo de su centro de cuidado infantil.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es que este hogar crezca y les permita salir adelante a estos ni\u00f1os que provienen de familias tan golpeadas por grandes dificultades. Adem\u00e1s espera mejorar poco a poco para que cada vez los ni\u00f1os se sientan m\u00e1s a gusto all\u00ed. \n","en":"Luz Maria is 50 years old and has been performing a great social work for 18 years: operating a child care center where she cares for approximately 80 children. She gives them good care and a good education while their parents, the majority of whom have few economic resources, are at work. Since she started her child care center, it has grown a lot and this has allowed her to attend to more and more children. It allows her to provide society with a good quality of life. Because of the large number of children who attend, her 20-year-old daughter works with her so that her child care center can offer the highest-quality education possible. Despite the fact that she looks after a large number of children, Luz Maria performs a kind of community assistance with the area residents, so she doesn't have a lot of capital available. This is why she is looking for a loan to repair the roof of her child care center.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that this home grows and allows these children to move forward, given that they come from families affected by great difficulties. She also hope to improve bit by bit so that bit by bit the children feel more comfortable there.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1085.09,"image":{"id":1171951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child

I am studying towards a Bachelor of Business Administration at The Maharishi Institute, and I am from a small township called Emzinoni in Bethal. \r\n\r\nMy father, who was the sole breadwinner in our family, passed away two years ago. I now live with my mother and sister and I am the first person in my family to attend University. My sister has completed her high school certificate. However she cannot pursue further studies due to financial constraints. My hobbies are writing, reciting poems and watching current affairs and talk shows.\r\n \r\nI plan to graduate in 2014 and my dream is to obtain a PhD in Economics, to pay tuition fees for children who come from poor backgrounds and to build a shelter for orphans in my hometown. A Kiva loan will help to ensure my education continues uninterrupted, allowing me to achieve my goals.

Romina is one of the members: in the picture, she is the second standing person from the left (she is the one wearing a brown top with a black cardigan, with black, untied hair). She has been selling used clothing and various accessories such as pins or stuffed animals for seven years. She says that she does that on Saturdays at a market stall from 10 to 14, and that on the other days of the week she sells beauty products from a catalogue. She receives the merchandise she needs for her business in packages from the city of Santiago, since if she buys wholesale from there, she can benefit from lower prices, which is an advantage. With the loan, Romina will buy house linens such as bedclothes and sheets, as well as seasonal articles that sell well in September, such as kites. One of her goals is to keep growing and have a shop, which would be more welcoming for customers, and hopefully provide her with a better quality of life. Romina lives with her mother and her son, who is four years old. Her dream to have a shop is to prepare for her son growing up and her needing more income to help him have a good life and a good future. She is very grateful for the opportunity afforded to her by field partner Fondo Esperanza, because it will help her invest in her business. Concerning her communal bank, she says that there is very good communication within it. Furthermore, the training courses it gives have enabled her to learn new sales strategies and accounting practices.

Gankhuyag, 44, sells second-hand clothes in an outdoor bazaar in Ulaanbaatar, which is the capital city of Mongolia. He has been operating his business for three years. He lives with his wife and two children in his ground-floor apartment that has two rooms. He keeps his stock in one of the rooms, and it is not very spacious for storing clothes. Currently, his family is using just one other room, and everything is crowded. His apartment was built in the early 1980s, and it has not undergone renovations in many years. In the winter, it suffers heat loss through its windows and wall corners, and the ceilings are frosted. Usually, he uses a coal or wood-fired stove in his kitchen to warm his home and dry out the moisture inside the rooms. He knows that it is very harmful to the health of his family members and the environment. So, he decided to make some repairs to his apartment.

She is a 51-year-old mother of five children. Her two sons have their own employment whilst another three are students and still under her responsibility.  \r\n\r\nFor the children's sake, she and her husband overcame the family's hardships by selling their handmade fish traps. They have been with this business for 15 years and are able to earn almost 15,000 Cambodian riels (KHR) per day. \r\n\r\nKhorn is new to VisionFund (a Kiva partner), the same as her group members.

paddy rice and beans as the primary source of income. To add to his income, he also raises cows and catches fish for resale. Having been in this business for seven years, he is able to earn about 39,000 KHR per day. After his daily expenses, he is able to save about 9,000 KHR each day on average. \r\n\r\nBunra joined VisionFund (Kiva's partner)  two cycles ago, and he managed to pay back the entire loans already.

is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nYasmeen is a 24-year-old young woman. She is married and a mother to one son. Her husband is employed and gets a low salary which is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nYasmeen wants to live in better home conditions with her family, so she is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing new living room furniture and dinning room furniture in order to improve the living conditions in her house. Taking this loan will offer to Yasmeen and her family comfortable furniture so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

","en":"Lica, 39, lives with her spouse and four children, ages 1 through 19, in the town of Soledad where she conducts the business activities with which she generates income to contribute to the growth of her household.  Lica sells a variety of merchandise such as clothing, cosmetics, and perfume.  She started this business when a friend offered her products she sold through specialized catalogues.  This was how Lica began her first business activity, without being affiliated with the organization her friend was in.\r\n\r\nIt went very well for Lica because little by little her business grew, so she began to give loans to new customers and to explore markets on their referrals.  Today, with the income from her business, she supports her household expenses, she has a select clientele, and she grants short-term loans adjusted to her customers' ability to pay.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is requesting her first Kiva loan, although this is her third loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the previous loans she has managed to increase her working capital, expand her clientele, and generate more profits all the time.\r\n\r\nHer first Kiva loan will allow her to invest in a greater volume of clothing and cosmetics than she is accustomed to and give continuity to the growth to which she is committed, so that she and her spouse can achieve greater well-being for their family.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1172259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothing, perfume, and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-27T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-26T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lica Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":77686},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":137832},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":141048},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":144339},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":147707},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":151153},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":154680},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":158289},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":161983},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":165762},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":169630},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":173588},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":177639},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":181784},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":186025},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":190366},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":194808},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":285681}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.24},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":464813,"name":"Ser","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ser, 31, lives a rural area located in the Dambae district of Kampong Cham province.

She hopes her crop yield will become more profitable and increase her family\u2019s income so as to earn a better living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1175440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pig feeds for her pig raising business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Prey Chhor district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-08-27T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-26T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sok","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Srey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1600000},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1017500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288681,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1017500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197172,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":814000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355941077,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1221000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837753,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T05:10:26Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":464821,"name":"Yasmeen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yasmeen is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband Yousef appears in her Kiva profile photo pictured in his grocery store.\r\nYasmeen is a 26-year-old young woman, she is married with no children yet.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Yasmeen's husband has had a grocery store selling different types of groceries. It has been a profitable project and the only source of income for the family, but not enough to cover their costs.\r\nYasmeen is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing needed stock of basic groceries that customers often request such as dairy products, canned food, sugar and  rice. This will increase sales and increase the family's income, which will enable Yasmeen and her husband to live in better conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is the mother of 2 children, who are 9 and 16 years old. She lives with them in the municipality of Soledad, where she has a business designing and selling women\u2019s clothing. She started this business 2 years ago, selling shoes to her friends. However, like a good designer, she got the idea to create a brand of clothing. So, she began designing articles of clothing, which small businesses make for her and which she later sells herself. Her main lines of designed products are women\u2019s clothing. However, she also sells shoes that she buys to resell by offering them on credit to her customers, according to their ability to repay. Her dream of prosperity is to open a store in her own house where she can sell her designs and shoes, items that her customers will find more accessible and in a comfortable atmosphere. She currently uses social networks for her advertizing strategy, and she combines this with visits to the homes of potential customers. Gina has come to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for her first Kiva loan. She will use it to buy raw materials such as fabrics, accessories, and also shoes that her customers have ordered from her and that she took note of when doing pre-sales.

She is a widowed mother of one son who is still living with her and helping the family\u2019s business. She struggles to feed her child through rice farming, cassava and rubber plants growing. She also has used her spare time to earn extra income by working for others for a fee for almost 30 years. She can earn about KHR 10,000 per day and save about KHR 7,000 each day after the daily expenses. \n\nYeng\u2019s group consists of two female members who live in the same village.

She has had health problems for some time, and it is becoming more and more difficult for her to sleep on her old, uncomfortable bed.

located in the Zaporozhskaya region of Ukraine.  His children are already grown and they help him on the farm.  Viktor has a large business, which includes a greenhouse and a breeding complex for pigs.  He has been in this line of work for 12 years.\r\n\r\nViktor plans to use his Kiva loan of 20,000 hryvnas to invest in grain for his animals.  He was offered a purchase of 10 tons of grain at a good price, which is why he needs this loan.  Very active and dedicated, Viktor is always trying to reach his goals.
