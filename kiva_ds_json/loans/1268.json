She is very thankful for the financial support offered by lenders, which enables her to develop her family-owned business as well as improve her living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":126,"image":{"id":1471553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to support her daughter and increase her clothing stock to sell in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 105.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-11-20T15:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-19T15:20:01Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":126,"local_amount":126,"processed_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439743045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-04T17:54:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":633664,"name":"Keidy Yanira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Keidy, tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su esposo con quien tiene un hijo y reside en el municipio de La Lima, Cortes.

They are on average 31 years old, married, and have at least 5 children. This group of women sells diverse products such as cloths, fruits and vegetables, plastics, second hand clothing, etc. In order to increase the size of their businesses, the members decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso. They are on their eighth group loan. Tenin, the first seated from the right to the left, expects to use her loan to buy a load of second hand clothing.

is 24 years old.  His name is Parviz.  He is a beginner businessman.  Parviz lives with his parents.  His parents have 2 hectares of land, where they are involved in agriculture.  A majority of the Farkhor district residents are involved in agriculture, plant vegetables, wheat, rice and cabbage.  Besides agriculture, animal husbandry is also popular in the district.  These types of businesses are in demand because the climate of Tajikistan allows for and is favorable to developing businesses in this area.  Parviz decided to get involved in animal husbandry.  He was able to build a cowshed so that his livestock would not get cold in the winter.  He bought hay and other livestock feed, and one cow.  Parviz was left with little money to buy more livestock and this is why he is requesting help.  Parviz will use this loan to buy bulls and calves.  He is not requesting a large amount because this business demands a lot of money and effort.  Parviz decided not to take a risk and started with a small amount.  He hopes that he will be supported and will receive help!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1471363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Su mayor desafi\u00f3 en cuanto a este rubro es mantener sus cultivos limpios de plagas e insectos que da\u00f1an la planta y la hortaliza ya que los precios de los insumos var\u00edan en el mercado y es dif\u00edcil comprar la cantidad necesaria para poder protegerlos.\nPor lo que hoy en d\u00eda ella se ve en la necesidad de solicitar financiamiento para la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas para dar asistencia t\u00e9cnica a sus cultivos de hortaliza como ser compra de fertilizantes, foliares fungicidas entre otros.\nElla sue\u00f1a en un futuro hacer unas mejoras en sus casa de habitaci\u00f3n que son necesarias para poder mantener libre de enfermedades respiratorias entre otras a la familia que son propagadas por la humedad, polvo, entre otros. Tambi\u00e9n hacer crecer sus cultivos sembrando y cultivando mayor cantidad de hortalizas y de esta forma obtener mayores ingresos que le permitan salir adelante con su familia y brindarles una mejor oportunidad de vida a sus hijos, educarlos de forma que ellos en un futuro sean personas preparadas y visionarias que cuiden el patrimonio que ella desea heredarles.\n","en":"Vicenta, 30, is a hardworking and enterprising woman with many dreams. She is married and has four dependent children. The oldest child works with his parents, while the three youngest are in different grades at a local school. Vicenta finished elementary school, thanks to her parents' moral and financial support, but she couldn't go further because her family could not afford it. \r\n\r\nVicenta has grown vegetables (potatoes) with her husband for eight years, but she learned to farm from her parents at a very early age, as the area is excellent for farming, intermediaries come to purchase here, and there are local market vendors. Her greatest challenge in her work is keeping the crops free of disease and insects that damage the plants and vegetables, since supply prices vary and it's hard to buy enough to protect her plantings.\r\n\r\nNow she needs a loan to buy supplies like fertilizer and fungicides to tend her plantings. She dreams of making necessary improvements to her house to keep her family free of respiratory problems due to humidity, dust, and more. She also wants to plant and grow more vegetables so that she earns more for her family and can give children better opportunities and an education that will allow them to be prepared and forward-thinking people that will care for the inheritance she wants to leave them."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1471009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies for her vegetable crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-20T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-19T20:20:06Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T00:02:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":633147,"name":"Dayana Milena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dayana de 30 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a la venta de ropa, calzado y electrodom\u00e9stico, desde hace 1 a\u00f1o, cuando dej\u00f3 de ser empleada y tom\u00f3 el dinero de su liquidaci\u00f3n, para dedicarse a una actividad que le generara ingresos para atender las necesidades de sus dos hijos.

She started to work, doing household chores, helping her mother, and helping her father when she could. \r\n \r\nHer mother taught her to make tamales to sell to earn money for her household. She grew up, found a life partner, and had a son. After a while, she separated from the father and began to strive alone to care for her son. Using what she learned from her mother, she has been making tamales for 18 years to support herself. Her son is now an adult.

","en":"Sharofat is a seamstress by trade. She is 37 years old. She lives with her husband and children in the Bohtar region. Her husband has recently returned from Russia, where he used to working for a packaging company. After returning to his native region in Tajikistan, he has not been able to find a decent job that would pay well. Sharofat wants to help out her husband. She does not want him to leave the family again and be a migrant worker elsewhere. Sharofat and her husband decided to buy a car so that he could start working as a taxi driver.

Maazamkhan has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Maazamkhan works with field crop cultivation, after having started 27 years ago with 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Maazamkhan's persistent work, she currently has two sheep and 0.60 hectares of land, on which she every year grows potatoes, sweet corn and hay to sell.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She owns a hairdressing salon, which she started three years ago after she finished a training program in a beauty school. Her sister-in-law trained to be a manicurist and pedicurist, and when she finished her training at the same time as Melissa, they decided to join together to start their own business venture. Today they provide beauty and hair treatments in their shop such as straightening, dyeing, highlighting, manicures and pedicures. Melissa and her sister-in-law buy their supplies from distributors in order to get wholesale prices, which they say are very competitive. Their main customers are neighbors and friends who, little by little, have referred many more people to them.\r\n\r\nThis is Melissa\u2019s fist loan with Kiva and the field partner.

She became a widow after her husband's death.  She has three children and also runs her own farm. Ainur has a vocational education. The family's main source of income is Ainur's animal husbandry business which she started 23 years ago with 5,000 KGS. Thanks to Ainur's hard work, her farm now boasts one milk cow, one bull, and fifteen sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Ainur has asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy cattle for breeding. Ainur plans to reinvest profits made from the loan into further expanding the number of animal she has. She is also planning to save money to educate her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1471607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bekitai village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-20T22:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-19T22:20:13Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainur","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":518.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-27T14:27:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":634073,"name":"Adamasay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 45-year-old Adamasay from Jui Eastern area in Freetown.

","en":"Diloromkhon is a kind woman of 38 years.  She is married, however, 7 years ago, her husband left to work in the Russian Federation and disappeared without a trace.  Diloromkhon does not know if he is dead or alive.  She is raising and supporting her five children by herself.  \r\n\r\nSince 1998, Diloromkhon has been carrying out her own business of selling fabrics at the local market.

At the time, she had been working as a school teacher and was receiving a small salary.  With great difficulty, she was able to raise her children.  Two of her daughters are now married and are running their own households.  Two of her sons are studying in high school.  She wants her children to receive university education and to become qualified specialists.  She is asking for a loan of 2700 somoni to pay for her daughter's university tuition.

Farishtamo is a homemaker and her husband is a farmer.   He owns four hectares (9.88 acres) of land and is involved in agriculture.  Farishtamo helps him with his farming business.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of her neighbors and fellow countrymen, Farishtamo has decided to launch her own business which will consist in buying and selling livestock.  Tajikistan's main sectors of activity  are crop farming and cattle breeding.  Farishtamo is taking a loan which she will use to buy young livestock.  She will buy young bulls and calves, will feed them for 30 to 35 days and then resell them at the cattle market.  The sum that she is requesting for this loan is quite small for the type of business she is planning to launch.\r\n\r\nFarishtamo hopes to be able to reach her goals and to start her new business.  She has confidence that she will receive help, which will help her to make her dream come true.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1471684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock and get involved in animal husbandry.

After the death of her husband, she is taking care of her son and grandson on her own as well as running her farm. Azymkul has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Azymkul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 11 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Azymkul's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows on her farm. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).

Erkebu has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Erkebu practices livestock breeding. She started this business 14 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 6,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Erkebu's hard work, she currently has 3 milk cows, 1 horse and 3 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 2,000 som (KGS).

Anara has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Anara practices livestock breeding. She started this business 20 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 6,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Anara's hard work, she currently has 8 horses and 10 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 3.000 som (KGS).

Alymkan has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Alymkan practices livestock breeding. She started this business 8 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Alymkan's hard work, she currently has 5 milk cows and 7 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Alymkan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to increase the size of her herd.

E Jona, developed by Suela and her partners, won the Albanian Social Business Competition run by Yunus Social Business, against more than 50 other competitors. This loan will help Suela finance the start-up costs of the E Jona coffee shop and provide the business with working capital for its first four months of operation.\r\n\r\nAround 137,000 people in Albania are affected by disability, which amounts to approximately 4.3% of the country\u2019s population. One of the many struggles faced by young people with disabilities in Albania is the inability to lead a normal social life due to restricted access to social places that appropriately accommodate their needs. Public locations, such as cinemas, caf\u00e9s, museums, restaurants and parks often have steps and other entry barriers in Albania. \r\n\r\nSuela wants to create a space where young people with disabilities can have opportunities to work, easily and comfortably socialize with friends and enjoy cultural activities. Furthermore, she wishes to foster the spirit of inclusion and to create an opportunity for non-disabled people to appreciate how joyful, inspiring and unique the life of a disabled person can be. Suela envisions that the space will become host to a unique atmosphere for exchanging skills and experiences between disabled and non-disabled visitors.\r\n\r\nE Jona will be a caf\u00e9 in Tirana, the capital city of Albania. The caf\u00e9 will be easily accessible to its visitors, have a light and friendly atmosphere and host an exciting program of cultural and entertainment events. E Jona will target both disabled and non-disabled young people, offering a range of attractions such as the display of artwork and craftwork, musical performances, theatre evenings, jewelry making training, sign language and braille courses, etc. The caf\u00e9 will serve cakes, cookies, sandwiches and other light snacks, as well as a range of barista coffees, teas and soft drinks. \r\n\r\nWith a range of exciting events, competitive prices and quality food and drinks, E Jona hopes to rise above competing coffee shops in Tirana and prove that it is not just a caf\u00e9 for disabled people, but an exciting venue that is open to all. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the shop will employ six young people with disabilities to work as managers, bartenders, waiters and helpers. The profits earned by E Jona will be reinvested into improving the program of events at the caf\u00e9. \r\n\r\nAs the first rent payment for the shop has already been paid, Suela is excited to open the doors to her caf\u00e9 as soon as possible. Suela appreciates the time you took to read about E Jona. By lending to her business, you will help create an exciting place for Albanian youth, with or without disabilities, to work, interact and spend time together and make an impression on each other\u2019s lives."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":49950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1470988,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2902,"youtubeId":"hhowuWE9q8Q","title":"Kiva Borrower

Kurpacha is put on the floor and is used instead of chairs, and kurpa is used in the winter as a quilt for sleeping. Munavar has been doing this for five years. Her only daughter helps her in the business. Munavar is married and also has two sons. She lives with her family in the region of Gafurov in the town of Khujand.\r\n\r\nMunavar's service is always in demand. Especially when people hold wedding celebrations they make kurpa and kurpacha as a dowry for the future bride or their daughter who is getting married. This is why Munavar's business is growing day by day and now she needs a loan.

She has three years experience and, with her children, who study culinary art, it has occurred to them to practice what they've learned taking into account the products most consumed by their target market. Due to a lack of employment, they decided that her son would generate his own family income supporting the business with the first capital with which they have done very well. Their sales are made in cash from 4 in the afternoon until 2 in the morning from Friday to Sunday and when it is a holiday. They make their purchases at wholesale and make sales directly to their neighbors in the area who are their main customers. Her future goal is to open a restaurant where she can add many more products that her son has learned in his studies in order to expand their income and be able to support her family as much as possible. Currently, she is applying for a loan, the first loan she's made with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy four sets of plastic tables and chairs and ingredients for fast food such as sausages, sauces, dairy fat,etc. With this investment, she will achieve better service for her customers and respond to the enormous demand that approaches in the months of November, December and January, the holiday season, when students and many members of their families are on vacation and consume a lot more of the delicious fast products that are prepared in Zulisma's business, which means her loan has potential for success."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":37.1,"image":{"id":1472008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy four sets of plastic tables and chairs, ingredients for fast food like sausages, sauces, dairy fat etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulisma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":70835},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":76110},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78393},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80745},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83167},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85662},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88232},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90879},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93606},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96414},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99306},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":106651}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.1,"local_amount":70835,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":71702.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732257,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T16:41:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":634835,"name":"Elizah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizah operates a food vending business, selling at the market to market dwellers and passersby.

She is engaged and is also the mother of four children. She owns her own restaurant, which she has run for years. It's thanks to this business that she is able to look after her family. Buying items for the restaurant in small quantities doesn't bring in much revenue for her. This is where the importance of this loan comes in. This loan will allow her to increase her stock of foodstuffs (sacks of peanuts, one sack of rice, a selection of fish and meats, raw vegetables and little extras needed for cooking her dishes) as well as new equipment. This will remove the need for daily shopping trips and cut down on her taxi expenses. This will also increase her profits.
