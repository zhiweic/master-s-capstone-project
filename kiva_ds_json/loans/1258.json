","en":"Olga is a 28 year old woman from the countryside, married with two chidlren who are 10 and 11 years old. Two years ago she begain cultivating potatoes on a rented lot under a community harvest system. She learned how to grow potatoes from her family. She sells her harvests in her town's local market, and by doing so earns enough income to support her husband with their home expenses. Olga tells us that with a lot of hard work and effort she has been able to overcome many difficulties that have arisen, especially the high costs of agricultutral ingredients and diminished prices at which she can sell her goods (which have caused the family some problems). Nevertheless, these difficulties have not stopped her from continuing her work, as her main goal is to get ahead so her children can have a better life. They are her motivation. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Olga is asking for a loan to invest in the purchase of wholesale agricultural ingredients (fertilizer, pesticide, and fungicide among others), which she will use to continue to care for her crops.

Wilson is currently attending the Universidad San Fransisco Xavier, working towards his degree in business administration. He plans on graduating in February, 2014, but without a loan from Vittana, he fears that he will need to defer his graduation. \n\nWith this loan, Wilson plans to cover the cost of his graduation fees. Often there are fees for earning your title in business administration before graduating. With a degree in business administration, he expects to earn $15 a day. \n\nUnfortunately, Wilson's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education.

This loan will be a great help to enable him to make improvements to the current businesses, and thereby boost more income for the family. He will continue with the loan and is hoping that he can secure the overall welfare of the entire

Keep in mind that coffee is very well paid on the market and it has allowed her enough revenues to support her child even when prices are low.\r\n\r\nHer clients are her neighbors, friends or middlemen who come to the area searching for good product as the climate is suitable and the soil is fertile. By harvest time the berries are very good thanks to the attention given them, part of this being the application of  agricultural supplies. Her major challenge is the instability of prices in the market. Competition is not a problem. \r\n\r\nDelma is requesting a loan today to be able to buy the supplies necessary to be able to continue protecting her coffee crops as she has done up to now. In this way she gets good beans at harvest time. \r\n\r\nHer goals are to be able to apply the supplies to her coffee crops to protect them against insects, infestations and frost so the berries don't get destroyed and the hours and days of her labor wasted. Also with the revenues generated she can buy another type of plant to grow a different variety of coffee to offer her buyers. Her priority is to see her son become a professional having a good education and the possibility of a better future.

They are responsible mothers and fathers with fifteen children under their care.  They are from Sauce, a place located in the northern part of the country.  Sauce is known for being a region that produces milk, cheese, and curds.  These people are known for being hardworking and responsible, with a desire for personal improvement.  Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t study for a university degree due to the poverty that they live with in rural zones.  Because of this, from day to day they fight to give their children a better future. That means that every day they have to put themselves at great risk to cross the river, because it is the only way to get around in the rural areas.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts and her desire to get ahead, the coordinator is Priscila. She works as a mobile bread vendor, also selling it from her home.

She is the mother of 5 children, 3 of whom are studying in a local elementary school, and 2 of whom are not yet school-aged.  Isaerma has only a first grade education, because her parents did not have the financial resources needed to support her education.  They taught her to farm at an early age, and today she continues doing this work alongside her husband.  \r\n\r\nThe land that she works with her husband is their own, thanks to a purchase that they made.  Their fields are located an hour away from their home.  One of their biggest challenges is the increase in prices of supplies that they use to tend to their crops, because they need these products to protect their crops.  The competition is not a problem for them.\r\n\r\nIsaerma has requested a loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative that will enable her to acquire agricultural supplies such as: 400 pounds of 12-24-12 (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium in %) fertilizer, 400 pounds of urea, 1,000 pounds of poultry manure, 1 liter of Daconil (fungicide), and 1 liter of Escore, to use in tending to her coffee plants.

Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can imagine the ideal person of Kyrgyzstan. It is a citizen who has a good education, sets long term goals of life. That\u2019s how I want to be. I was dreaming about studying Business Administration (BA) at AUCA. The idea and interest of this specialty came to me when I was participating in the \u201cTech Age Girls\u201d project organized by IREX. As a finalist of this project, I went to Bishkek for a two-week conference and learned a lot of useful information. This project totally changed my life and goals. During the conference, I have met with famous women leaders who achieved a lot in their life, such as deputy Shirin Aitmatova, US Ambassador to Kyrgysztan, Pamela L. Spratlen, and others. \r\n\r\nThe idea of studying BA came to me during the course \u201cbusiness etiquette\u201d. In this course I learned how business corporations work and how to behave in a business organization. In the second week of conference, I participated in a mini-internship at one of the IT companies in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nI want to learn more about production, how business companies use marketing to know the value of the product. In the future, I want to be a manager and a business woman in Kyrgyzstan. My ideal woman leader is Gulnara Kalikova. She is a successful business woman and I inspire her leadership skills.\r\n\r\nDuring and after my studies at AUCA I want to continue helping to people by actively participating in civil society initiatives. With gained knowledge and skills from BA department I want to contribute to the development of my country.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not able to afford full tuition at AUCA. I hope to get a KIVA loan to ensure that I will not have to struggle with my finances while I pursue my

graduated from the New Generation Academy of AUCA this year, and enrolled AUCA, department of Sociology.\r\n \r\nLira was one of the finalists of ACCESS Program.

She conducted training independently, and made very good presentations on education projects, as well as worked on social projects. \r\n\r\nACCESS Program is a competitive program, and participants are from all over Kyrgyzstan. This year, 270 students have been selected, and Lira is known to be one of the honored students between 20. Lira is proficient in MS programs, such as MS Office, Moviemaker, Picaso, etc.\r\n \r\nLira also participated in \u201cSummer School of Democracy 2012\u201d, where she had the opportunity of meeting with senior officials. It is worth mentioning the Lira\u2019s contribution to social project of ACCESS Program is collecting books for orphanages of Kant city. She also opened classes at American Corner where she was teaching children drawing and making presentations on great painters of the world.\r\n\r\nAll the above mentioned experiences will give her an opportunity to take an active part of social life at AUCA, and greatly make contributions to it. \r\nBut her family cannot fully pay the tuition fees. So, Lira needs Kiva loan so that she could study without thinking about finance.

Below is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year I finished my high school and I did have ideas in which university I wanted to study, but the main question was who I wanted to be in the future. During the studies in my secondary school, I never thought that I would have a chance to study in the New Generation Academy, and I got more opportunity after studying in NGA, which is also within AUCA. Studying at the Academy taught me to be brave, ambitious and never give up even when I do not succeed in something. \r\n\r\nDuring the preparation year, I studied in all-round English, Kyrgyz and Russian languages; I also studied math, history and computer. Professors prepared us for our future education at AUCA. They also helped to determine our choices of which department to choose. I also gained huge experience in analytical thinking and communication skills. Preparatory courses at AUCA gave me all the necessary knowledge to become a deserving student at AUCA.\r\n\r\nSo, I chose the Psychology Department to study and I have been asking myself many times why exactly this department. First, I enjoy working with people and helping them in solving their problems. But in the beginning, I did not have much information and knowledge on this subject. Fortunately, I took part in the presentation of the psychology department. I'll never forget this atmosphere and the moment when the professors began telling us about something new we never heard about in our life. One of the professors said: \u201cPsychology studies the mental state of a person\u2019s inner world. The psychologist does not cure, but helps people to find harmony, both with you and with the people around you\u201d.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned made me think about the decision that I made finally. I am sure I will manage to be one of the best students in the Psychology Department at AUCA.\r\n\r\nThere are some financial difficulties in my family though and therefore I am applying for a KIVA loan. A KIVA loan will help me to fully dedicate myself to education and not to think about the money that would cover my tuition.\u201d

He lives in Chiatura with his wife, brother and grandparents. His grandparents are provided with a retirement pension. George is actively involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has three cows and a pig. His wife milks the cows every day and produces cheese to sell. In addition, the family owns a small piece of agricultural land where different kinds of vegetables are grown for family use. George sometimes works physically to increase the income of his family. As the income is not stable, George decided to start his own business. The Start Up program, which is the joint initiative with Kiva and Credo, enables him to get a loan of 3,300 GEL to open a fast food business.

In 9th grade I became a volunteer at the Tourist Information Center. I got a huge experience in working with foreigners. I have also participated in the contest 'Stolypin reforms' on behalf of the school, which was organized by the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University. I won second place and was awarded an encyclopedia. In the same year I represented our school in the district Olympiad of English language and won 3rd place. At another event, conducted by the International University of Kyrgyzstan, our team took second place. The competition was on developing a business plan. I was awarded a certificate for making presentations at the 'Science nourish young' festival, dedicated to the 300th Anniversary of the university. \r\n\r\nI am happy to enroll in AUCA, but unfortunately my family is not able to cover the tuition fees fully.
