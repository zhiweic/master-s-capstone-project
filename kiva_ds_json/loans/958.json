She has lived in a rental home for two years along with her three children, whom she loves very much. \r\n\r\nFor five years she has made handcrafted embroidery; she started after being invited by one of her friends, who taught her how to do it.

For these reasons she does not have a fixed work schedule, but she is very steadfast in the creation of her embroidery. Due to the complexity of the work and the thickness of the embroidery on the fabric, it takes up to a month to complete. As a result she produces a beautiful, traditional garment that draws admiration from her customers, and finally these are bought in cash. \r\n\r\nThe most profitable time in her business is during the full season of festivities, typically called the Festival of Santiago in honor of the animals, and which is much celebrated in the region.

Owing to natural disaster (drought) Nivardo's small plot of onions did not ripen well.  This disaster meant that he failed to earn what he was expecting.  Owing to the distance and remoteness of his community, he came to live in the province, seeking a better standard of living for his whole family.  In the place where he lives, they only harvest their crops once a year.  They do not have irrigation and have to wait for the rainy season to grow their crops.

is 30 years old and a married woman with five children, some of whom are too young and really need her care. Soem is a farmer working on one hectare of farmland in Prey Chor district of Kompong Cham province. The income from this business is barely enough to cover her daily costs and this encouraged Soem to get involved in a hog-raising business to secure the family out of poverty.

Rampur Block of Kalahandi district in Odisha, India. The Kalahandi district is a most backward district with rural poor people. This group was started in 2010 with the purpose of raising the income level of their families. Gopi is one of them. The lady standing third from the left with the raised hand in the photo is Gopi. She is 39 years old and lives with her husband and two sons aged 22 and 20. Her sons are attending college at M. rampur. \r\n\r\nGopi maintains her family by running a vehicle spares parts shop attached with a repair workshop at the road point of her village, which is two km away from Kusurla, with the help of her husband. She has given employment to three youths in the workshop and is paying each 2000 Indian Rupees (INR) per month. She says that the prices of spare parts are changing very frequently and that she has been a victim of the price rise many times due to her frequent replenishment cycle. \r\n\r\nTo safeguard her from price fluctuations, Gopi will use the loan to buy spare parts in bulk and store them. She has contacted a spare parts wholesaler to take items of 1.3 lakhs (130,000 INR) in credit with a security deposit of 30,000 INR. This will help her to save the repeated transportation and purchasing costs. Gopi dreams to provide her two sons better technical education like engineering. So she and her husband are working very hard to save money to materialize their cherished dream. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Chanchala, Baidehi, Taruni, Mamata and Dulana, who have a book store and Xerox center, daily needs shop, general store, barber center and mobile phone repairing center respectively for development of their family condition.

recently had financial problems.  Her name is Gulizor, she is 43 years old, and she is married with five children at home.  Her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation.  She lives in a climate which is very favorable for the cultivation of agricultural crops as well as livestock.  Gulizor has been engaged in animal husbandry for several years now and she sells her livestock after fattening them up for a few months.  She has many clients in the market and she wants to increase her business, but she doesn't have sufficient funds to do so.  She is asking for a loan of $2,000 USD to buy livestock so she can increase her business.  With the proceeds from this increased income, she plans on paying for her children's education and technology.

She says that her business is located in a shop near her house, she works every day, sometimes her son helps her when she has to do personal formalities, and her schedule is according to her availability.  The merchandise and supplies that she needs she buys from dairy distributors and beverage importers at low cost, therefore they are financially suitable.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan she will buy only beer in order to stock up her store.\r\n\r\nOne of Maria's goals is to add a bakery to her shop, and with this generate more income for her family.  Maria lives with her husband, three children, and a small nephew who is under her care.  Her work-related dreams are to continue growing and adding supplies to her business, and her dreams for her family are that they do not lack anything and that they have a good quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful and pleased with the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has offered her because it allows her to invest in her business.  Furthermore, she feels comfortable with the company of the other entrepreneurs in the communal bank since they share different activities and interests, which has also served as a pastime for her.  In respect to the skills taught in the meetings, she has learned to manage her business in a better way.\r\n\r\nOsorno is a city located in the southern area of Chile, in the Los Lagos region.

is a 17-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nTisiya was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nTisiya is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum. and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nDisplaced from her home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo when she was just a small girl, Tisiya grew up in the Kyangwali refugee camp in Uganda, where she endured unspeakably poor sanitary conditions, battled malnutrition, and witnessed extreme human suffering. Instead of resigning herself to a life of misfortune, she saw in Kyangwali the opportunity to do tremendous good.\n\nTisiya has always believed that education is the key to success and in the refugee camp started study groups to help other village students with their studies.  As a solution to the shortage of textbooks for the students, Tisiya formed discussion groups for each class level and selected group leaders for each based on their academic aptitude (to assist weaker students) and their age. On weekends they gathered in larger groups, and Tisia often taught these classes. \n\nIn her hostel in the refugee camp, Tisiya acted as the academic prefect and head girl, overseeing approximately 100 fellow students. She also managed a small hostel library to ensure that the 80+ students who lived in the hostel benefited from the few books provided to them.  She also served as a counselor at her secondary school to help and encourage students to overcome hardships they faced in school. \n\nTisiya is passionate about helping African culture to \u201cupdate\u201d itself so as to \u201cmove with the fast changing world,\" while maintaining pride in its rich and varied culture and traditions. When Tisiya\u2019s grandfather passed away in her refugee camp, she realized that younger people were losing essential information about Africa\u2019s history as elders in her community continued to pass away.  She created a group in the refugee camp called the Voyager Team with other students who share a passion to learn more about Africa. Tisiya thinks it is important to learn about traditional African history and pass it on to generations to come. \u201cWe are getting first-hand information that builds us and we share it with other youth. By realizing that ancient Africans did great things, youth are able to believe in themselves and accept that that they can do even greater since the world has much more opportunities through modern technology,\u201d Tisiya explains.\n\nIn 2007, Tisiya passed primary school with a First, becoming the first girl to get the First in the history of the Kyangwali refuge settlement in Uganda\u2019s national examination.\n\nTisiya is passionate about leading positive change in her community. She wants to be a leader and face issues of instability and poverty, so that there can be peaceful communities.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1207767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tisiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748415,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735298,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614231,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-01T19:54:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":473206,"name":"Debora Ernestina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Debora es una persona muy trabajadora que tiene un negocio de servicio de comida con el cual genera los ingresos para el sostenimiento de su hogar donde convive con sus 3 hijos.

His particular village has only two poorly built primary schools, with few instructors and limited teaching materials.  Noticing the extremely low academic performance amongt the village children, Rellikson took it upon himself to do something about the situation. He launched a tutoring program, dedicating his weekends to mentor students in his district and volunteering as a teacher two days a week for the past three years. As a result of Rellikson\u2019s tremendous efforts, the academic performance of these students increased tremendously and some were even admitted to provincial schools. Rellikson continues to support students academically by writing an INSHA book (composition and essay in Kiswahili) \u2013 a guide book for primary school students to improve their writing skills. \n\nRellikson\u2019s passion for community service was also evidenced by his dogged determination to address the problem of water-borne diseases facing his village. A proactive and pragmatic leader, Rellikson realized that the high rate of water-borne diseases in his village was largely due to the lack of toilets. Rellikson sought to address this problem by digging pit latrines and encouraging others in his village to do so. He has since recorded a dramatic reduction in the number of deaths from cholera, typhoid, and dysentery in his village \u2013 a remarkable feat from the efforts of a single young boy.\n\nAcademically, Rellikson has achieved extraordinary results. He was the first student in his district to join Alliance High School, one of the best high schools in Kenya, and holds as many as twenty academic certificates. Rellikson\u2019s natural ability to lead others in his community was formally recognized by the numerous leadership positions he held at his school, including class prefect, chapel praise and worship leader, and dorm prayer coordinator. He was also a Sunday school teacher in his community church, and he was invited to be a motivational speaker and teacher at his primary school. \n\nRellikson is very interested in the field of medicine.  He hopes to impact Africa by seeking practical solutions to address the problems of poor health services and widespread diseases on the continent. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1207770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rellikson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748417,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735300,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614233,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-01T22:22:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479457,"name":"Ukeme","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ukeme is a 17-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nUkeme was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nUkeme is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nUkeme comes from Ikpot Ekpene, Nigeria.\n\nDespite his young age, Ukeme has an innate ability to lead others and is passionate about positively impacting his community. Recognizing the need for a decent road in his community, Ukeme single-handedly spear-headed a project for the construction of a new road despite having had no formal training or expertise therein. In his spare time, he filled empty bags of cement with sand and would lay them in major holes on the road. He then added timber during the rainy season and constructed a gutter to encourage water flow. \n\nDespite initial skepticism from his community, Ukeme was able to get other members of the community to assist him in constructing the road. After some time, Ukeme and his fellow community members had managed to successfully construct a road fit for use by vehicles.\n\nUkeme is also a budding entrepreneur. During school, he established and maintained his own restaurant business. He sold sachets of water to earn money to start up the restaurant business, and he made contacts with traders so he could obtain food items. In Nigeria, Ukeme would sell food items very early in the morning and on Saturdays so his business would not interfere with his academics. The business started as a small store beside his house where he sold small food items, and in time it grew to the point where he could rent a space near a school campus for his business.\n\nAs Ukeme\u2019s restaurant became more successful, his family became involved in the preparation of food items and he even now has two additional employees who work at his restaurant. The revenue from Ukeme\u2019s business contributed to the payment of his school fees and also provides money for a separate youth organizations that Ukeme runs. \n\nUkeme aspires to impact Africa by establishing Africa\u2019s first continental health organization, similar to the WHO, but with a unique focus on medical development in Africa. Through this organization, Ukeme wants to reduce the high mortality rates throughout the continent and also reduce the high number of maternal deaths.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1207772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ukeme","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748418,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735301,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614234,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-02T00:53:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479458,"name":"Chidubem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chidubem is a 17-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nChidubem was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nChidubem is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nChidubem comes from Abuja, Nigeria and is one of a family of six.\n\nAt school in Suleja, Nigeria, Chidubem\u2019s natural ability to lead others was recognized by his extensive involvement in a number of clubs and societies as well as the numerous leadership positions he held.

In Senegal, Bakary co-founded a club to raise awareness about AIDS and malaria in the village of Bango. As part of this effort, the club distributed much-needed mosquito netting and provided HIV testing. As credit to his ability to take initiative, he was nominated by the religious leader of his community to lead the youth in a community cleaning campaign. A testament to his strong leadership capabilities, Bakary was also elected as prefect of his junior high school. \n\nBakary also has a natural flair for language. He won first prize in three Scrabble competitions before forming the Scrabble club at his school. He also won first prize for a writing competition. \n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1207776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T19:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T19:00:19Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748421,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735304,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614237,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-02T00:26:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479462,"name":"Mame Oulimata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mame is a 17-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nMame was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nMame is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nMame comes from Dakar, Senegal and is one of a family of five.\n\nA young leader committed to serving her community, Mame is passionate about the environment and has participated in many cleaning campaigns organized by the youth in her area. \n\nShe also has a keen interest in public health and wants to become a doctor and create an NGO like the Red Cross that will specifically target Africa and provide efficient healthcare.

At school in Johannesburg, Thato noticed the high number of students at her school from impoverished backgrounds who came to school without any food, and she sought to find a way to support her peers without revealing anyone's socioeconomic status. Thato launched a feeding scheme together with her Life Orientation teacher. This program included planting seeds for vegetables that could be grown on a sustainable basis. Thato ran the project by raising money for equipment, seeds, and other required resources. She also managed to get sponsors and volunteers to help maintain the garden.\n\nThato\u2019s track record of involvement in community outreach is extensive.

She has been selling milk and baby calves to the locals and has been making a small income which is enough to live. Now she wants to expand by buying another milk cow with a calf.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan for the first time, hoping that lenders will grant her request.\r\n\r\nZina is confident that she will do well, and her promise to lenders is that she will pay them back on time.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1069.7,"image":{"id":1199563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

He has taken care of them for three years in the house in the community.\r\n\r\nThe job this exemplary son does is raise sheep of the Jun\u00edn breed, which is his main specialty because he learned how to take care of them and breed them.  He has rancher customers who buy his sheep for their herds, especially males for breeding.  \"This job is my main entertainment,\" he says.\r\n\r\nHe also studied computer engineering, and now he's working in that field in a Peruvian state hospital.  He receives a monthly salary that allows him to support his family's financial stability because he helps his mother with the household expenses.  One of his plans is to continue studying and open a solid business that will allow him to support his expenses over the long term.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to Hacienda Communal Bank and this is his fourth loan with MFP, where he's happy because he receives everybody's help, which allows him to continue in his business.  He also promises to make his payments punctually because his bank is made up of responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nJhossy will invest the requested money in buying sheep of a good breed to energize his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1196029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhossy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529127,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-18T00:38:35Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":473282,"name":"Hernan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Hernan es una persona muy trabajadora indican varias personas de su zona, el esta separado hace mas de seis a\u00f1os de su pareja, actualmente vive solo, hace dos a\u00f1os que \u00e9l trabaja en la localidad de puerto villarroel, se dedica a la pesca, cuenta con un peque\u00f1o barquito de pesca con un motor fuera de borda que se compro de segunda mano, \u00e9l se levanta a muy tempranas horas por la ma\u00f1ana para ir a rio arriba y as\u00ed poder pescar los mejores peces y poder comercializarlos en el pueblo, vive con sus dos hijos, cabe se\u00f1alar que sus hijos son personas casadas e independientes, \u00e9l es muy feliz alado de sus nietos pero \u00e9l se esmera para tratar de llevar una vida mejor junto a su familia, el necesita mejorar sus herramientas de trabajo y as\u00ed mejorar su desempe\u00f1o en la pesca","en":"Various people who live near Hernan said he is a very hard working person.

Lacking of water supply is the main challenge for her rice paddy-field.\r\n\r\nChhy has been with VisionFund for six cycles and has fully paid back the past loans while the other members of this group are just with VisionFund this cycle. The past loans have helped her better support her family\u2019s living. Now she is leading her group of three to seek a loan. Chhy will use her portion to buy fertilizer and rice seeds for her farmland and use a portion of it to spend on buying more grocery items for resale. With this loan she hopes to grow her rice more healthfully and timely so as to make her family's living better.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1200130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":" To buy
