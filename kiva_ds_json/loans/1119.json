It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nNeslie hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams that her children will finish their studies.

They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and resell them to foundries, factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPrescilla hopes that her business will expand and dreams of having a better life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1349434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for recyclable materials needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-05-14T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-13T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Precilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6785.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894968,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5332.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5427.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381670007,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5333.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5427.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534537,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2714.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399783933,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-14T19:37:48Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:53:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559199,"name":"Campesinos De Tzunun\u00e1 1 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Felix  es el l\u00edder del Grupo Campesino 1 (de camisa celeste, segundo de derecha a izquierda primera fila en la fotograf\u00eda) es un se\u00f1or  de 41 a\u00f1os de edad quien  tiene 5 hijos,  quienes viven en la aldea Tzunun\u00e1,  departamento de Solol\u00e1.\nEl es caficultor, la siembra, mantenimiento y producci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9  lo realiza en su parcela, eligi\u00f3 esta actividad por su rentabilidad y lleva 20  a\u00f1os dedic\u00e1ndose a esta labor que heredo de su padre, de esta manera obtiene la mayor parte de sus ingresos para el sostenimiento familiar.\nEl est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de fertilizante para el mantenimiento de su caf\u00e9.\nSue\u00f1a con brindarle una mejor calidad de vida a su familia.\n","en":"Felix is the leader of the \"Campesino 1\" Group (in the light blue shirt, second from the right in the first row in the photograph).

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community, and she earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan to help her continue the operations of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMa. Flora hopes that her business will continue to grow, and dreams that her children will finish their studies.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and she draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Simeon owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

is a permanent resident of Rwenkuba of the Bushenyi district. He is married with 5 children and lives with 2 of his sisters' children, as she is unable to pay for their fees, so he is giving her a hand. He did not go far in his studies and hence started to fend for himself and the family when he was still young. Being pushed by the need to survive, he started banana farming on a small scale on his family's land that his parents allowed him to cultivate on. Because he is hard working, he has used his small savings to buy even more land where he is constructing a house.

He has ten years of experience in the snow cone business. He learned about this business from a young age because his mother made a living selling snow cones. She taught him to prepare the syrup and make good snow cones. He did not have the opportunity to study because they live in poverty. Therefore, he decided to start his own business, as his mother taught him, in order to have a means of subsistence. He leaves his house every day at 6:00 a.m. to buy ice and ingredients to make the syrup, among other products which he needs. The journey takes about twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nHe has applied for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy a motorcycle, which he will use to sell the snow cones and expand his business. He has to travel great distances to the area's schools to sell snow cones to the children. Therefore, he needs another motorcycle and he will employ another person to help him.

Not different from his neighborhood, he also does rice cultivation on a 1.5 hectare area. He is able to earn up to 33,000 KHR (Cambodian riels) per day from the current business that he has been with for five years. \r\n\r\nBuntheourn, a seven-time borrower, formed a group of two with a second-time borrower in order to apply for a new loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

His harvest is just as good as that from flat fields.\r\n\r\nWhen An\u00edbal needs to buy supplies for his farm, he travels 30 minutes by bus from his hillside community.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is seeking from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy six bags of fertilizer, a gallon of herbicide, 50 pounds of corn seed, and other supplies for his 14,000 m2 land. The money will help him obtain the necessary supplies in time and in sufficient quantities to ensure a good harvest. He will also be able to build a brick house so that his children can live more comfortably.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1349936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy fertilizer, herbicide, seeds etc for his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-05-15T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-14T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"An\u00edbal Isa\u00ed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T08:28:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":550758,"name":"Sargis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sargis has been involved in agriculture for 16 years.

He has been in the business for the last 20 years and says his main aim is to boost his income and send his six children to school. He has purposely applied for this loan to buy dairy cows and buy veterinary drugs to treat local breeds.   \nHe hopes to use this facility to buy Freisian bulls for cross breeding for better yields. He will then be able to pay for further studies for his six children.\nDaudah confesses that his main challenge dealing with cattle and livestock is diseases like foot and mouth disease, as well as droughts that have run on for over eight months. However he is happy to have acquired six hectares of land which is now an extension of his grazing land. \nIn the photograph is Daudah at his homestead.

He sells the animals at a profit after fattening them for a period of six to 12 months. His clients are different people from the neighborhood who buy the  animals for slaughter. His dream is to buy plots in the nearby trading center and build rental houses which will help him pay university fees for his children without any difficulty.He would like to use the loan proceeds for buying some calves for fattening. His main challenge is that sometimes animals overstay in the farm and when that happens, he loses money. Hillary is a very hardworking and committed gentleman who respects his loan repayment dates.

business.  About a year ago, she began renting a small stall at a local market where she sells her goods such as socks, children's clothing.  In the beginning, Olga was afraid of starting her own business since everyone was talking about the financial crisis.  Now, she doesn't doesn't regret it and is glad she took that step.  She requires a loan of 5,000 hryvnia in order to replenish her inventory at her stall and to buy a new batch of children's socks, pants and shirts.  She plans to improve her business.  Not long ago, she found a better space at the market and hopes, with time, to move and begin selling there once she saves up the money."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":416,"image":{"id":1348650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to replenish goods at her store and buy a batch of children's socks, pants and shirts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Khoost","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-05-15T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-14T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":424}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372947144,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-02T09:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726695,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-27T08:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589846,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-23T08:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399834218,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410109622,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874499,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429523046,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440005987,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T17:26:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":558452,"name":"Judith Gyadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La clienta Judith vive en Guayaquil.

Aminata needs a loan in order to buy more textiles for clothing. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 400,000.

She will use this loan to restock her charcoal supply again. She dreams to expand her businesses more. \r\n\r\nMaua will share this loan with her loan group Salasala, which totals 10 members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.
