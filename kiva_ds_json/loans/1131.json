Doreen has requested a loan of $800 to buy feed and vaccines which are crucial to the perfect growth of the chickens and also to egg production.

Mangala Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" In the Balangir district of Odisha, India, Baijayanti Pada is one of the slum areas of Balangir Municipality which hails from Ward No.12. There is a special identity of this slum area which is that it is inhabited by the Mahar community (Weavers of Bamboo). Most of the inhabitants of this community are very poor and far away from the basic necessities of life like shelter and education. They reside in small huts and their children get rarely get good education. \r\n\r\nThe main business of this community is making hand fans of bamboo and selling them in the market, railway station and bus stop and in nearby villages.The income they get from their business is spent hand to mouth for them. To overcome this situation, in the year 2010 six women of this community formed a Joint Liability Group named Maa Mangala with the objective of accessing a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the overall development of their family, to improve their existing businesses. Archana, aged about 35, is the featured member, sitting on the extreme left with raised hand. She is married and resides in a small hut with her four-member family, comprised of her husband and two daughters aged 8 & 4.  \r\n\r\nThe business of Archana (making of bamboo hand fans) is a traditional business of their community. Archana and her husband jointly do the processing work and make hand fans. To procure raw materials, they have to go 100 kilometer away by train and bring back the raw bamboo. Both the wife and husband sell their products in the town market, railway station & bus station. They also supply their products to traders. \r\n\r\nArchana earns a monthly income of Rs.3000 from her business. This small income never meets the minimum needs of the family.

They reside in small huts and their children rarely get good education. \r\n\r\nThe main business of this community is making hand fans out of bamboo and selling them in the market, railway station and bus stations and nearby villages. The income they get from this is used hand-to-mouth for them.

Both the wife and husband sell the finished products in the town market, railway & bus station. Apart from the making of hand fans, Lata also procures finished products from the neighbors and sells them in bulk to traders from other places. \r\n\r\nLata earns a monthly income of 5000 INR from this business. According to Lata, this small income is not at all sufficient to meet the requirements of her family. So she wants to raise her production for more income.

The special identity of this slum area is that it is inhabited by the Mahar community (Weavers of Bamboo).The inhabitants of this community are very poor and far away from the basic necessities of life like shelter and education. They reside in small huts and their children can rarely get a good education. \r\n\r\nThe main business of this community is making hand fans of bamboo and selling them in the market, railway station and bus stand and nearby villages. The income they get from this is hand-to-mouth for them. To overcome this  situation, in the year 2010 six women of this community formed a Joint Liability Group named Mirabai to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to add some extra income for their family so as to improve their existing status. Bisaya, aged about 41, is one of them. The lady sitting second from right with raised hand in the photograph is Bisaya. She lives with her husband, one son of 25 years and two daughters of 20 and 18 in a small house. \r\n\r\nBisaya is doing her traditional business of bamboo crafts (making bamboo hand fans).All Bisaya's family members do the processing work and make hand fans. Bisaya procures the raw materials from a distant place, 100 kilometer away. Bisaya sells the finished products in the town, railway station and bus stand. She earns a monthly income of 5000 INR from her business. This small income is barely enough for Bisaya to manage her family expenses. So to meet the expenses smoothly, Bisaya wants to increase the income of her family. From the present loan she is planning to purchase raw bamboo and coloring for making more hand fans. She believes that this will help her to increase her income level to some extent. Bisaya dreams of repairing her house and constructing another room for her family.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Gulapi (running a rice business along with tailoring) and Labani, Rabi, Gita and Sonia doing the same business of bamboo hand fan weaving. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1359864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To pay for purchasing bamboo and coloring","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Gulapi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Labani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bisaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":76000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":76000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T22:08:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565336,"name":"Natividad De Maria Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Natividad de Maria est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 1\u00ba del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres est\u00e1n aprendiendo a trabajar juntas y tienen como meta crecer y ayudar a sus familias por medio del trabajo en conjunto.\nFlora, una de las miembros, se dedica a la venta ambulante de frutas, ella es una persona muy trabajadora, que vio como una gran oportunidad la de formar parte de este grupo, ya que podr\u00e1 mejorar su econom\u00eda y tambi\u00e9n recibir capacitaciones para poder crecer como persona.\nLa Sra.

This will help her to get more output in less time and generate more time to work. \r\n\r\nFrom the present loan Simanchlam is planning to purchase an ornament-designing machine and some goldsmith accessories.

She began her business because she needs to create income to support her family. She works at the business every day from morning to night. She says that the main challenges to her business are lack of finances to operate her business and transportation problems.\r\n\r\nMarie requires a loan in order to purchase more gallons of palm oil for resale.

She is not married and lives with her parents. A year ago, in order to support her family she began her own business selling women's clothing and fabric. At first she worked as a seamstress of women's clothing, but she did not make a good income so she switched to selling instead. Her brother helps run the business. She sells goods at the local market, and she tries to provide clients with high quality. She is planning to buy goods for the next season, but does not have enough funds so she is asking for a 7500 somoni loan to buy new merchandise.

He lives far from the city, but has had a wonderful idea, to expand his business. His name is Rustam, and he is 43 years old, married, and the father of four children. The climate in his area is great for growing crops, as well as raising livestock. For the past three years he has been raising animals, primarily small livestock, though he does have one cow. He has a large garden where he grows hay for the animals. He sells the animals after he has raised them for a number of months. He has many customers at the market. Rustam would like to expand his business but he doesn't have the necessary capital. He is asking for a 3000 somoni loan to buy 6 head of small livestock. With the income he earns from the expansion he wants to provide his children with a good education and modern technology. He is grateful for your generosity. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":351.83,"image":{"id":1359504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle for developing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rustam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":204.8},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":224.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":223.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":241.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":244.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":251.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":260.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":265.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":277.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":284.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":292.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.58,"local_amount":205.75,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":212.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693596,"comment":null},{"amount":49.17,"local_amount":226.94,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":233.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556422,"comment":null},{"amount":48.67,"local_amount":224.63,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":231.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550256,"comment":null},{"amount":49.44,"local_amount":228.17,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":235.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410959222,"comment":null},{"amount":52.75,"local_amount":243.48,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":250.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075383,"comment":null},{"amount":52.62,"local_amount":242.84,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":250.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228057,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":251.98,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":259.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989026,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T18:43:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565383,"name":"Kadiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 29-year-old Kadiatu from Moriba town in Sierra Leone.

He was born in 1965. He has extensive experience in animal husbandry. His father raised livestock and Atamjon helped him from a young age. Now it is his livelihood; he has grown up and followed in his father's footsteps. He began his business with five head of sheep. It wasn't easy at first, especially in winter. But with years of experience he came into his own and found his way to methods and decisions to improve his work. Today he has over five head of cattle, and recently bought a female cow. His wife and five children also help. In addition to animal husbandry Atamjon also works as a contract laborer to earn more money for his children's education and daily expenses. Because of the season he cannot currently sell his animals, as the price has fallen. Atamjon needs additional capital for further feeding and to purchase new animals. With this goal he came to Arvand for a loan. He is planning to use the loan to buy livestock and feed. He is grateful to Arvand for their support and the huge role they play in his life.

Despite his age he is a very diligent entrepreneur and has extensive experience with raising cattle. He buys bull calves, feeds them for four or five months, and sells them to butchers. Gulom is a very goal oriented person. In 2010 he decided to buy and sell cattle feed. He buys the feed from a distant region, transports it, and sells it.

The lady standing in front in the photograph with her hand raised is Jyotshnarani. She is 24 years old and lives with her husband and seven-month-old daughter. Jyotshnarani\u2019s husband has been running a multifarious business that includes a photocopy center, stationary store, thread wholesaling and a cloth center for the last 12 years. After marriage, Jyotshnarani has been helping her husband. All these trades are running under one roof. Jyotshnarani gets a monthly income of 7,000 INR from the business. Out of this income, she is barely able to manage her household expenses along with her business expenses. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. From the present loan, Jyotshnarani wants to purchase more stock of cold drinks, stationary, thread and blouse pieces. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she has to replenish her stock frequently. Jyotshnarani hopes to save enough to start a kid\u2019s readymade garment shop and give a better education to her only girl child.

Mahbuba is a homemaker, but she was advised by her relatives to get started in raising livestock.  She liked this suggestion very much and she has now been involved in raising and selling sheep and goats for eight years.  Mahbuba also raises cattle at her home and she has a great amount of experience in this area - it brings in some extra money for the family budget.  For Mahbuba, raising animals is not just her work, it is a pleasure.  At the moment, she wants to buy cattle to raise, but she doesn't have enough money for this and she has turned to Arvand.

She comes from a family of civil servants; her parents are teachers and after finishing high school, Mahbuba followed in her parents footsteps and enrolled in the pedagogical institute in 1994.  On graduating from the institute, she started working in a high school in the Spitamen region.  Mahbuba's husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation.  Since the salaries in the school system are very low, she had to quit her profession and start working in a shop.  For more than six years, Mahbuba has been selling women's shoes in a local market.  She is a very responsible and conscientious woman with strong willpower.  She needs money to increase her trade, so she has turned to Arvand for help.  Mahbuba wants to expand her business and she will use this loan to buy a new assortment of women's shoes.  She thanks Arvand for their great

She lives with her partner and is the mother of five children who are still dependent.  The family live in their own home.  Digna completed her primary education thanks to the efforts and determination of her parents who wanted her to have a basic education.  However, she was not able to continue her education as her family did not have enough money.  Digna has a lot of farming experience as she has been growing bananas, coffee, plantains, beans, corn etc. for 20 years.  Her customers are different buyers who come to her area, as well as neighbors and friends who know that she grows good quality produce.  Digna and her partner own the lands that they sow as they worked hard for many years to buy them.  They are located 500 meters from their home and they travel there on foot.  \r\n\r\nDigna is currently requesting help to buy manure and fertilizers with which to maintain her crops.  This support will enable her to protect her coffee plants as it will help to keep them safer from pests and other problems.\r\n\r\nDigna's dream is to keep improving her crops so that she can improve her harvests a little more in terms of both variety and quality.  She would also like to make some improvements to her home.

After graduating from high school, he did not go to college because it was not possible for him. Husan is married and has five children. His wife is a homemaker, but she helps him feed the cattle and sell dairy products to people in their neighborhood. Since Husan is the provider for the family, he started to get involved in retail sales. At first his business was very small. He dreamed of expanding his business, but he didn't have enough money to do this. In 2005 he turned to Arvand. Over the next eight years, with Arvand's cooperation, he improved his business, and thanks to a loan opened a new retail location for selling food products. In considering the demand for products, Husan would like increase his assortment of merchandise, but does not have enough money and has once again turned to Arvand. Husan is a very responsible and punctual person. He thanks MDO Arvand in advance."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1352006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T12:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T12:50:01Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Husan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":247},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":251.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":256.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":262.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":267.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":272.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":278.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":283.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":289.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":295.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":295.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565575,"name":"William","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"William is a 55-year-old married man with seven children, living in Kyenjojo, Uganda.

Therefore, for the past 7 years, with the profession of security guard he also drives a taxi at night. But currently he is not able to generate any income from the taxi, as its engine is not working properly and needs to be repaired. \r\n\r\nMahvish, as a member of a three-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to meet the amount of repairing the engine of her husband's taxi. With the profit, her husband wants to open a new auto mechanic shop in the future. Mahvish desires to provide quality education to all her children, and she prays for the good health of her family and for the growth of her husband's business. She is very much thankful to Kiva and BRAC.

","en":"Inomchon lives in a rural village, not far from the city. He lives together with his mother. His father died a long time ago, when Inomchon was 8, leaving them alone. His mother raised the children by herself, which was very difficult. So now he is all grown up, and is already 36. He is married and has three children. He built his family on his own. Because of his circumstances, he could not go to college; his mother needed his help at home. But he graduated successfully from high school. He has worked on a collective farm since he was young, and has always loved animals. When he was still a young boy, he used to feed the cattle together with his father. Now whenever he feeds the cattle, he is reminded of his father. Right now Inomchon works at the collective farm and is also raising cattle. His capital has decreased because of family difficulties. Now it is his busy season, and he wants to increase his number of animals. For this he has turned to Arvand for a loan. Incomchon plans to use the loan to buy a cow and expand his business, which is very profitable."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":549.89,"image":{"id":1349567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inomjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":74.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":78.47},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":84.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.1,"local_amount":73.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":73.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752036,"comment":null},{"amount":74.85,"local_amount":74.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":74.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616123,"comment":null},{"amount":76.64,"local_amount":76.64,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":76.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859993,"comment":null},{"amount":78.47,"local_amount":78.47,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":78.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136738,"comment":null},{"amount":80.34,"local_amount":80.34,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":80.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900933,"comment":null},{"amount":82.26,"local_amount":82.26,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":82.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550116,"comment":null},{"amount":84.23,"local_amount":84.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774341,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-27T07:20:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565591,"name":"Samina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samina is a 32-year-old responsible and hardworking housewife.

However, due to the lack of funds, he finds it difficult. Therefore, Walayat as a member of a 3-person lending group has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase the needful things for her husband's shop. \r\n\r\nHer husband's work depends upon electricity because he has to grind the spices for sale and there is a huge loadshedding issue (regular power outages) in the area. Walayat prays that this issue will soon resolve so that her husband can continue his work efficiently.

is a 23-year-old single young man living in rural southern Albania who is seeking lenders' attention. He wants to add some more goats of a good breed to his family\u2019s existing goat herd. Klodjan\u2019s parents have been in the animal husbandry activity since the collapse of the regime.

Her group is called Moralito and she says that they named the group after the neighborhood where they meet once a week to make their loan repayments.  Elena has participated in several loan cycles with Visi\u00f3n Fund and she says that she likes belonging to this financial institution because it is serious and respects its clients.  \r\n\r\nElena grew up helping her parents on their stall selling strawberries and cream, fries, fried pork rinds, pancakes, prepared plantains, different flavors of filled churros, etc.  They would set up their stall wherever there were open air markets or public celebrations in surrounding communities and also in their own town.  She says that eight years ago she decided to set up her own business so that she could provide for her family.  She has two children who are currently in elementary school.  Her husband is an employee but sometimes helps her out in her business selling fried food and snacks.  \r\n\r\nElena is requesting a loan to buy the supplies she needs to make her snacks.  She says that she will buy flour, sugar, cream, plantains, condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, caramel, different flavors of jam, chocolate, strawberries, gas, potatoes, oil and other products.  She says that her dream is to increase the size of her stall a little because sometimes she is unable to fit in everything that she sells.  She would also like to buy a slightly larger refrigerator to put her products in so that they don't go off.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are called Juana Guadalupe, Rosa Isela, Mar\u00eda Felicitas, Oliva, Ana Laura, Mar\u00eda Virginia, Ana Lilia, Beatriz, Pablo and Mar\u00eda Isabel.

","en":"Mavzuna was born in Kanibadam.  She enrolled in university after finishing school and finished with good marks.  She got married afterwards, but her jealous husband would not allow her to work.  Mavzuna resigned herself to the fact that family is more important than a career.  They were happy, but her husband had to leave for Russia to find work, as he wasn't able to find good work with a decent salary at home.  Mavzuna was left with two children, the youngest of whom was only a year old, and she had to work at home herself and also find money on which to live.  She began to bake pastries, buns and all kinds of sweets at home to sell to local shops, and in return bought flour and other ingredients.  In this way, she increased the income of her business.  Now Mavzuna is already a professional baker.  She has opened her own stall at the local market to sell her sweets, and now she needs to buy a big oven so improve the quality of her buns.  She has turned to Arvand for this.  Mavzuna is very happy that, with the help of a loan from Arvand, she is able to have a decent income and improve her living

He spent a year selling dried fruits in Russia, and now he wants to work in his own country and start his own business there.  He is asking for a loan to construct a shop near where he lives.  Aziz already has part of the building materials (sand, cement), but he plans to use the loan to hire construction workers and to buy the building materials and shop fittings he is missing.  He has some savings that he started from his work abroad, and he plans to use that to buy furnishings for the shop - a refrigerator, shelves, etc, as well as products to sell.  The village where Aziz lives does not have a market other than kiosks and shops with a small assortment of goods at high prices.  This gives him a good advantage, as there is less competition.  Aziz's wife will help him in the shop.  He is counting on your support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1360538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy building materials for a shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aziz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":837}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565638,"name":"Shareefan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shareefan, 45, is a married woman.

is a 28-year-old married man. He lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia with his wife and parents. His parents have a retirement pension. George requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGeorge has a Donner fast food in the capital city. This is his only source of income. George requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. George has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit George will purchase a special apparatus for beer, which will be placed in his fast food and George will offer his clients an additional product.

She sells pads, malarial drugs, and tabs and injections. She has been running this business for five years. She works at the business, six days per week and twelve hours per day. She says, at present, her business is doing well. Out of the profit, she is able to have her source of living.\r\n\r\nComfort has requested a loan in order to purchase more medical drugs, including pads, malarial drugs, and tabs and injections, to expand her enterprise. The extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her children's school fees and change her status of living. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to open a big clinic, so that she can help her community from illness.

Nubia says that a girlfriend invited her to join the group because she knew she wouldn\u2019t disappoint them and that\u2019s why she invited her.\r\n\r\nShe works selling second-hand clothes and shoes at a street market in her town and outside her house.  She stocks up on clothes in other street markets where she buys them more inexpensively and then she resells them outside her house to earn a little profit.  She says she sells clothes for women, men and children.  She relates that she started the business because she didn\u2019t have a stable job and started selling her own clothes that she didn\u2019t wear anymore and seeing that it sold quickly she decided she\u2019d better go into selling second-hand clothes full-time.\r\n\r\nAt present she\u2019s asking for a loan to stock up because the months of May and June are of high demand due to Mother\u2019s Day and the end of the school year.  She puts a lot of effort into her work because she wants her daughter to have a better quality of life and want for nothing.  Nubia\u2019s dream is to build a locale at home where her business is better established so that she can be protected from weather inclemency and her clothes and shoes that she sells won\u2019t be damaged.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are called Cristina, Rosa, Mariana, Jorge, Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, Adriana, Teresa, Jaime and Norma.  They will invest in their businesses: to buy shoes and clothes by catalog, to buy supplies to make artisanal clothing, to buy bread baking ingredients, to buy supplies to make crafts to sell, to buy ingredients and corn on the cob to then sell cooked and to buy clothes for women and men to resell.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7275,"image":{"id":1359764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

All of her children are studying in school. \r\n\r\nRukhsana and her husband have owned a fast food business for five years, which is the only source of income for their family. Now, for the further growth of their business, Rukhsana has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase some crockery and chairs for the restaurant. \r\n\r\nSince their family expenditures are much higher, as compared to the monthly income and savings, she wants to open a new shop for her husband with the profit. As a result, they can increase their monthly income as well as their savings. Rukhsana dreams for the higher education of her children. She is very much thankful to Kiva for such great help and kindness.\r\n\r\nNOTE: In the picture, Rukhsana is raising her

is a married man aged 44 years with 5 children. He lives in Bigavu-kyango village with his family. Lolensi also takes care of three other children who are orphans. Four of his children are still attending secondary school in Rakai.\r\n\r\nHe is a farmer who deals in agriculture, specifically coffee growing. He has been in coffee growing since 2008 and he concentrated on coffee growing due to availability of enough land for cultivation, and because he also had experience in coffee growing from his father who used to grow it.

He owns a general store, which is the only source of income for the family. His monthly income is inadequate to meet the household's needs. Presently, he is in need of purchasing a variety of products, like flour, wheat, pulses, eggs, soap, detergent, sugar, and rice, for the store. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Shazia has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase the necessary things for her husband's business. She hopes that the loan will be helpful to her husband. \r\n\r\nShazia wants to provide a quality education to her children. She hopes that she can prove herself to be a successful mother.

is a 38 year old man. He lives in Lahore, Pakistan. He is a father of 6 children. He owns a furniture shop in the market which is the only source of income for the family. He sells chairs, tables, and beds in his shop. \n\nPresently he is interested in offering more variety to his customers. This will help him increase his net income and savings as well.

The members of this Communal Bank engage in various businesses such as selling used clothing, selling empanadas, making potato pancakes, managing a bazaar, operating a parcel service, making desserts, and producing woven items.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarmen Gloria started her business of selling used clothing four years ago.  With the help of her friends, she was able to overcome her shyness so that she could begin selling products on the street.  Thanks to her efforts, she and her friends have been able to rent a small vending stall at the fair.  She is very pleased that she has had more success with her business since the extra money means that she can provide a bit more support for her household.  The loan she is requesting will be used to buy bundles of used clothing so that she can improve the inventory of merchandise that she offers to her customers.  For this reason, Carmen Gloria is very pleased and is confident that she will do well during this period.

llamado Quetzal, los cuales piden cr\u00e9ditos para mejorar sus negocios. Conchita, como de cari\u00f1o le dicen, se dedica desde hace 3 a\u00f1os a la elaboraci\u00f3n de tortillas hechas a mano ya que no ten\u00eda trabajo estable porque ella no tiene estudios y se le hace dif\u00edcil conseguir un trabajo porque no sabe leer ni escribir, ella no fue a la escuela porque a sus pap\u00e1s no les alcazaba para los gastos de sus \u00fatiles escolares. Es por eso que Concepci\u00f3n decidi\u00f3 poner su propio negocio y con la ayuda de su esposo logr\u00f3 comprar un comal y poner un puesto de tortillas en su casa, las cuales hace a diario y vende por docenas, dice ella \u201clas m\u00e1s ricas y baratas del lugar\u201d, y tambi\u00e9n puso el negocio para ayudar a su esposo con los gastos de sus hijos ya que lo que \u00e9l gana como empleado no le alcanzaba. Platica que al principio s\u00ed le era dif\u00edcil conseguir clientes ya que hay mas personas que venden tortillas pero ahorita tiene ya sus propias clientes ya que ella elabora sus productos 100% de ma\u00edz y eso le gusta a las personas porque las tortillas duran un poco m\u00e1s y tienen mejor sabor. A diario, ella se levanta a muy temprana hora a poner el nixtamal y lo lleva a moler  para obtener la masa con la cual hace las tortillas, ella usa un comal de barro y le\u00f1a porque dice que as\u00ed obtienen un mejor sabor las tortillas. Platica que est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de ma\u00edz, le\u00f1a, cal y otro comal ya que nada m\u00e1s le dura 3 meses de tanto uso y es que este material tambi\u00e9n es m\u00e1s delicado. La meta de Conchita es  tener m\u00e1s clientes y hacerse de un puesto en la central de abastos de una poblaci\u00f3n cercana a la de ella para obtener m\u00e1s ganancias. Los dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo se llaman Anastasia, Gonzalo, Maribel, Ma. del Pueblito, Noheli Alejandra, Maricela, Virginia, Martha Isabel y Norma Edith, ellas invertir\u00e1n en sus negocios en la compra de insumos para elaborar antojitos mexicanos como tacos, pambazos, quesadillas, etc, para la compra de insumos para elaborar pan para vender, compra de insumos para vender en tienda de abarrotes, para dar mantenimiento a un veh\u00edculo de fletes y mudanzas, para la compra de material para la elaboraci\u00f3n de bisuter\u00eda, para la compra de material para elaborar servilletas bordadas y para la compra y venta de frutas y legumbres de temporada.","en":"Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n, 38, says that a girlfriend invited her some months ago to become part of a group called \u201cQuetzal\u201d that asks for loans to improve their businesses.  Conchita, like she\u2019s affectionately called, has worked for the last three years making hand-made tortillas since she had no job because she never went to school and it\u2019s hard for her to get a job since she doesn\u2019t know how to read or write.  She never attended school because her parents didn\u2019t have enough to pay for school supplies.  This is why Concepci\u00f3n decided to open her own business to help her husband with their children\u2019s expenses since what he earns as an employee isn\u2019t enough.   She relates that at first it was difficult to get customers because there are other people who sell tortillas but now she has her own customers because she makes tortillas 100% of corn and people like that because the tortillas last a little longer and taste better.  \r\n\r\nShe rises very early every day to start the \u2018nixtamal\u2019 [maize boiled in lime water] and then take it to be ground into dough to make tortillas.  She uses a clay griddle and firewood because she says the tortillas taste better that way.  She relates that she\u2019s asking for this loan to buy corn, firewood, lime powder and another griddle because they only last three months because of all the use they get and this material is also more delicate.  Conchita\u2019s goal is to have more customers and to get a stand in the wholesale food market in a town nearby so she can earn higher profits.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are called Anastasia, Maribel, Mar\u00eda del Pueblito, Nohel\u00ed Alejandra, Maricela, Virginia, Martha Isabel and Norma Edith.  They will invest in their businesses which are: Mexican fast-food snacks like tacos, \u2018pambazos\u2019 [bread filled with chorizo and potatoes and dipped in red chili sauce], quesadillas [flour tortilla filled with cheese and other ingredients], and others, grocery store, moving and storage vehicle repair, costume jewelry making, materials and supplies to make embroidered napkins and seasonal fruit and vegetable sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7600,"image":{"id":1351519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is 30 years old, married and responsible for 2 children, the older of whom is in kindergarten. She completed her primary education as she was able to study thanks to her parents' efforts. She is a housewife part-time and she works part-time in agriculture, supporting her husband with the various activities that are done to cultivate coffee. The land that she works on together with her husband was acquired thanks to a family inheritance, and their other piece of land was acquired with great care and sacrifice over a long period of hard work, even though it's located 20 minutes from their home.

","en":"Mavzuna is a young and happy woman, who is 34 years old.  She is married and has three beautiful children.  Mavzuna and her family live in a village far away from a city.  This is a little bit difficult for her children because they attend a city school, located fairly far from the village.  But Mavzuna and her husband do everything possible to make sure that their children are not in need and develop just like other children, and attend a good school.  They have to work a lot for this in order to satisfy all needs and desires of their family.  This is why they are involved in their own business.  Mavzuna buys food products in the city and brings them to her village for sale.  She owns a small store, where she can sell the products.  Also, her husband brings in an additional income home.  He is involved in farming.  He works in the field every day.  Mavzuna also has a younger brother.  He lives with his parents, who are retired.  He wants to get married next year, but now needs to earn money for this event.  Mavzuna decided to send her brother to work in Russia because he would be able to earn more money there than if he worked here.  This is why Mavzuna wants to obtain a loan from Arvand and purchase a ticket for her brother's trip to Russia.  She wants to help her brother very much and thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1358117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to purchase a ticket for her brother to travel to Russia for work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavzuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":152.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":157.51},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":163.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":168.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":174.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":180.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":187.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":193.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":200.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":207.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":214.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.34,"local_amount":152.18,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":153.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616126,"comment":null},{"amount":392.66,"local_amount":1847.82,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1867.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859996,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T12:15:12Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565730,"name":"Jumwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jumwa is a widow.

is 39 years old. He lives in a small village of Terjola District with his parents. His parents are provided with a retirement pension. Aleksi requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. Besides, they have a vineyard, with 500 grapevines. They sell the harvested products and cheese at local markets. Alongside the agricultural activities, Aleksi serves local people as a taxi driver with his car. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAleksi requested a loan from Credo to start-up family business. Aleksi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Aleksi will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built, he will be able to sow the seeds of vegetables and sell the harvested vegetables at a good price. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Presently, he needs to purchase iron rods, welding rods, and soldering rods for manufacturing iron doors and windows. However, due to the lack of income, he finds it difficult. Therefore, Musarat as a member of a two-person group has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase the needed items for her husband's business.

His monthly income is inadequate to meet the household needs. \r\n\r\nPresently, Ghazala's husband is in need of purchasing chickens to sell.

Therefore, Ghazala, as a member of two-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband to purchase products for his shop.

is 45 years old and married with three children. He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his wife and children in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He is a Fuzuli refugee.  \r\n\r\nFor past ten years, he has been raising sheep because mutton is in high demand in this region. Kazim is a retired person with an income of 100 AZN monthly from this business. This is a very profitable business and Kazim is doing it together with his wife.\r\n\r\nHe is keeping a flock of sheep in his own yard. He fattens them and takes their meat to the central bazaar, where butchers and customers purchase from him.

She began her business because she needs to generate income to take care of herself and her family. She works at the business every day, from morning to night.  She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation.\r\n\r\nAgness requires a loan in order to purchase palm oil, gari and general stock.

is a 53 years old and the mother of four children. She is an IDP (internally displaced person) from Jabrayil and lives with her husband and children in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. She is a hardworking person who takes care of her family by doing business in animal sales. Alfunur raises cattle to sell the meat. She has been in this business for 12 years. Her husband supports her in the business. The business takes a lot of effort, but together they run it successfully. Alfunur sells the meat in the central bazaar, where the demand for meat is high.
