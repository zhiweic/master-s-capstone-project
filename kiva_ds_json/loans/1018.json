He is single and lives with his father in the \"Luz de America\" parish in Santo Domingo - one of the newest towns in Ecuador; it  was built where the mountainous and coastal regions of the country meet. It is a very special place, non only because of its rich ethnic diversity, but also because of the unusual landscapes one can find from the moment one enters this beautiful town. Santo Domingo de los Colorados is part of the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, which has only recently ben formed.\r\nSanto Domingo's main fair attracts many visitors and allows for cultural and commercial exchanges. The fair takes place at the Ranchers' Association's facilities, where the best examples of a variety of breeds and crossbreeds raised by the region's ranchers compete. Manuel and his father have been working in farming for 15 years and this activity is their livelihood. Manuel has done well which has allowed him to lead a modest life. He learnt to work in farming from his family, who comes from an ethnic culture where farming is the main source of work. Manuel needs a loan to purchase fertilizer as well as other supplies so he can take care of his crops and avoid losses. He dreams that one day he may be able to build his own house and car. He would also like to meet a woman with whom he could start a good family. And this is his life's goal, which he believes to be more important than his economic goal. He is grateful to Fundacion Alternativa who helps those in the rural sector and believes in entrepreneurs who want to grow their businesses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1128.19,"image":{"id":1255343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She lives in a small city together with her family. She has three children who go to high school. Her husband has gone to the Russian Federation in order to find suitable work. \r\n\r\nNajobat works as an accountant at an organization and has many years of experience. In addition she works with processing apricots. She spends her salary and the income from processing apricots on purchasing food products, clothing and the children's education. She can hardly cope with the expenses as her husband sends little money. \r\n\r\nNajobat and her family lives in an old house, where it is necessary to carry out maintenance.

She has been working as an English teacher at a school for 14 years.  Her salary is not enough for living and this is why she was accepted to the third year of the finance and credit department of the Tajikistan State Commerce University this year with a goal of obtaining a second degree and finding a suitable job with a high salary in the future in order to have enough to provide for her three children.  Her husband is a doctor and his salary is not enough to help his wife to pay for the education contract.  Farhunda came to our organization to obtain a loan.

She is married and has 2 children aged  16 and 3 years. In 2006, she established her drinks and cosmetics business, which she began because she wants to develop herself and her family. Her business is located in the outskirts of town and her main customers are women and men. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about SLL 700,000 every month. Titty requires a loan of SLL 3,000,000 in order to purchase soft drinks, pure drinking water, perming cream, and weaving hair for resale.

","en":"Almakul is 51 years old and a mother of four children.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in selling food products in her At-Bashy village since 1992, having started this business with a sum of 1,000 som.  Thanks to Almakul's hard work, her business yields about 25,000 som per month, which serves as the foundation for covering expenses for food and consumer needs of the family.  Thanks to the fact that Almakul is a very communicative and kind woman, her store customers love her very much and have very positive feedback about her.  The income from the business allowed Almakul to provide education for her children.  In order to further develop her business, Almakul requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase goods turnover at the store.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing her business further and use some of the income to save for her children's education.

She is raising one child. The primary business of Aigul's family is the fattening up and resale of cattle. Beginning in 2003 with the initial amount of 20,000 Kyrgyz Som, her agricultural business now brings in about 3,000 Kyrgyz Som per month. Currently, Aigul has one milk cow, three sheep and five goats in her stock. For the future expansion of her herd, Aigul turned to the Company \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" to request a loan in the amount of 80,000 Kyrgyz Som for the purchase of additional livestock. This would allow her to expand her agricultural business and increase her number of livestock. In her opinion, doing this is the very best kind of investment.

Oktyabr has a higher education and has very good feedback from her neighbors.  They say that she is a kind and hardworking woman.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 2000, having started this business with a sum of 8,000 KGS.  Thanks to Oktyabr's hard work, her business contains four cows, 20 sheep, 20 goats and one horse, and yields about 12,000 KGS per month from sales of milk and dairy products, which serves as the foundation for covering expenses for food and consumer needs of the family.  Besides selling milk, she is involved in feeding and reselling livestock.  The income from the business allowed Oktyabr to marry off and provide for her children.  In order to further develop her business, Oktyabr requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls and sheep because livestock prices are very low.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further expanding her business and wants to make housing repairs at home.

Throughout the period of getting the loan, she showed herself as a responsible, decent, conscientious and entrepreneurial person with a sense of duty and knowing how to correctly direct and invest monetary means to the needed purpose.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, Kayragul has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 1992, having started this business with a sum of 100,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, her business yields about 15,000 KGS per month, which serves as the foundation for covering expenses for food and consumer needs of the family.  Kayragul also works on 1.80 hectares of land with wheat, beans, vegetables and perennial herbs.  At this time, she has a very developed business that contains six cows, 25 sheep and 55 goats.  The income from the business allowed Kayragul to provide education for her children.  In order to further develop her business, Kayragul requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls and sheep.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further growing her business and to save some of the income for her son's education in Bishkek and dreams of buying a house for her son in Bishkek."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":1255522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

","en":"Aigul was born into a family of shepherds in the village of Kyzyl-Tuu. Her whole childhood was connected with raising livestock, as her parents grazed 500-600 head of sheep and goats each grazing season. When Aigul became an adult, she took a course for salespeople in the capital city and began to work as a salesclerk. In 2009, she got married, and she and her husband returned to her home village in 2010. For the first years after the family's move, Aigul experienced difficulties, there was no opportunity to expand the farm or to find employment, but in time they rented 1 hectare of land and began to grow potatoes. Later, as a means of expanding the business, Aigul got involved in animal husbandry, buying cows and selling milk. Today, her profit from milk sales is approximately 5,000 Som (KGS.) For the purpose of developing her business, Aigul has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 Som (KGS) to buy 2 cows. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to increase her livestock herd, and to get a large farm in the future.

is 36 years old, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines, and married to Rafael. She is a vendor and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages her household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJonalyn operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only the usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of time and money to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than buying raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She is also into a direct-selling business for additional income. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of Php20000. She will be using the loan to buy greater quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJonalyn hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of giving her children a high-quality education. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work; this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Thanks to the hard work of Gulmayram and her family, the farm now has three cows and a herd of sheep and goats.  The sale of their milk and dairy products brings about 15,000 som (KGS) per month.  With the goal of developing her business further, Gulmayram has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy three dairy cows.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\nAgustina operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Aside from this she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php1000 in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20, 000 loan.

Two of her four children, a well as their grandfather, have become farmers and help in the family business.  Since 1994, Kantayim's family have been successful in raising livestock and selling their products at the market.  Beginning with a starting sum of 5,000 som (KGS), Kantayim has increased her farm's monthly income to 7,000 som.  To further increase the size of her herd, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 20,000 som (KGS) to buy some more livestock to raise.  She plans on using her increased income to build a new barn so she can improve the living conditions of her cattle and to marry off her son in the

Her sewing workshop is located at the Sikasso Grand Market, where she already has 4 sewing machines, 2 of which are embroidery machines and 2 of which are simple sewing machines. Matogoma is much in demand by her client\u00e8le because of the quality of her services.\r\n\r\nIn order to better satisfy her growing client\u00e8le, Matogoma decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution.

She is married, has two children, and lives with her husband in Hamdallaye, Sikasso.  Korotoumou set up her business buying and selling fruit, veg and tubers more than twenty years ago.  She sells her produce from her stall in the market and she has a lot of demand from customers owing to the good quality of her goods.  In order to satisfy her ever-growing customer base, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution approximately one year ago.  Having paid back her previous individual loan on time and in full, she is now requesting her second loan which will allow her to increase her working capital and buy half a pick-up truck load of plantains and 10 sacks of potatoes.\r\n\r\nKorotoumou buys her produce directly from farmers who come from surrounding villages.  She then re-sells the produce at the new M\u00e9dine fruit and veg market.  Most of her customers are itinerant merchants and they come from all over.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Korotoumou plans to make a monthly profit of 170,000 francs.  She will use this money to increase her working capital, cover family expenses and pay the interest on her loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1257500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy plantains and potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T15:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T15:20:14Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":137131.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922785,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":137131.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819374,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":133333.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":137131.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207267,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-17T16:48:04Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T19:17:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508384,"name":"Goysam","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Goysam est une jeune femme de 23 ans.

is from Kharagauli District, West Georgia. He is 29 years old and lives with his wife, parents, and three children. He works as a joiner locally and gets a small monthly income. The family is involved in the agricultural business. Specifically, they have a small dairy farm consisting of a calf and four milk cows, whose milk is used for cheese production. In addition, they grow different kinds of vegetables on the family-owned land. Part of the harvested production is sold at the local open market, and the rest is used for family needs. He runs an animal husbandry business as well and has 5 pigs. Lasha works hard, but the family still doesn\u2019t have enough income for some savings and to improve their living conditions. According to government estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category and they get monthly social assistance.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lasha will purchase pigs. He will place the pigs in a shed located in their yard, raise them, and after several months the family will be able to have piglets. This will increase the family's animal husbandry business and their income as well. With the increased income, Lasha will improve their living

He is 53 years old and is married to a wonderful woman with whom he has lived for many years.  His wife is a high school teacher and earns a small salary.  With the goal of providing for his family's needs, Ahmat started a business eight years ago in which he provides a taxi service.  He works hard to give the best service so he can attract more clients.  His eldest children also work, but Ahmat is the family's main breadwinner.  His salary is barely enough to live on and he has not been able to make repairs on his home for a few years, as he has no savings.  His home is very old, dirty and has no normal living conveniences.  His clever wife suggested that he ask for a loan to make the repairs.  This idea was the reason why Ahmat came to our organization to ask for a loan of 600 US dollars to buy building materials like cement and wood.  He is a repeat client and promised to repay his loan on time.  This loan helps a low-income family improve their living conditions.  Ahmat awaits your kindness and is counting on you alone."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1255645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy building materials like cement and wood for repairing his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Yavan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.313056 69.043056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahmat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":42.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":57.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.79,"local_amount":42.79,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":42.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740933,"comment":null},{"amount":44.89,"local_amount":44.89,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":44.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056234,"comment":null},{"amount":46.74,"local_amount":46.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":46.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801932,"comment":null},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":45.82,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":45.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510178,"comment":null},{"amount":419.76,"local_amount":419.76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":419.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915463,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-31T22:17:39Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":507590,"name":"Rahim","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0418\u0441\u0444\u0430\u0440\u044b. \u0415\u043c\u0443 63 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e 1 \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a. \u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c 40 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043e\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u0441 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044b.","en":"Rahim lives in the city of Isfara.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 23,000-PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCrisanta hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
