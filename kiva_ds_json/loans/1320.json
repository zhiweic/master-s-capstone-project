He realizes income from selling the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of the family's income. \r\n\r\nKarapet's wife helps him greatly in his everyday activities. However, the income is so insignificant, compared with the needs of family, that they live under the poverty level and get 250 GEL social assistance from the local government.

El terreno que su esposo trabaja es propio el cual est\u00e1 ubicado a 500 metros de distancia desde su casa de habitaci\u00f3n al cual se traslada caminando.\nActualmente ella ha solicitado financiamiento a la cooperativa COMIXMUL pata la compra de abono, formula cafetalera, fertilizantes, foliares entre otros para dar asistencia y protecci\u00f3n a sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 con los cuales planea sacar una buena cosecha y un grano atractivo para sus clientes.\nSus planes son mejorar y abonar la tierra que ellos cultivan para que sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 mantengan el follaje y el grano sano ya que de esta forma ellos podr\u00e1n contar con una cosecha segura. Su sue\u00f1o es como el de toda madre apoyar a su hijo en sus estudios y lograr enviarlo a la universidad para que \u00e9l pueda graduarse de una carrera universitaria y que no pase por la misma situaci\u00f3n que ellos en su juventud.\n","en":"Amelia, 22, is a young married woman and the mother of a little one-year-old and of her second child, because she's three months pregnant.  She completed elementary school thanks to her parents, who supported her financially as well as morally.  It was her parents who taught her to grow coffee.\r\n\r\nCurrently Amelia's a homemaker: she can't help her partner with the various farming tasks because of her pregnancy, but she can help in the home.  Her partner also works in construction but only when there are opportunities, because growing coffee is his priority.  The land her husband works is her own; it's located 500 meters from their home and he walks there.\r\n\r\nCurrently she has requested a loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative to buy soil amendments, coffee formula, fertilizer, foliars, and other inputs to take care of and protect her coffee crops.  This way she'll get a good harvest and an attractive bean for her customers.\r\n\r\nAmelia's plans are to improve and fertilize the land she cultivates so her coffee crops maintain their foliage and healthy bean and they'll be able to have a healthy crop.  Her dream is that of very mother--to support her son in his studies and send him to college so he can graduate and not go through the same situation they did in their childhood.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1503243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural inputs for her coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-31T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia Yamileth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T15:25:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":652686,"name":"Ana Yanira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana  tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad y habita en condiciones muy humildes junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus cuatro hijos de 19 a\u00f1os, 16 a\u00f1os, 14 a\u00f1os y 12 a\u00f1os de edad.

Muhamed works as a lumberjack, cutting wood and selling it to others in the community in order to provide heat during the cold weather. He started working in this field a long time ago; however he has now managed to become independent and work for himself. He needs a loan in order to repair  his saw from all of the wear and tear damage it has sustained over time, and he also would like to renovate his workshop where he keeps his saw and cuts his wood. \r\n\r\nThe loan will help his work become more effective and efficient and therefore improve his services, which will continue to help his family and give them everything they need.

Mar\u00eda is applying for a loan from FUSAI in order to invest in building a septic tank, for which she needs to buy cement, bricks, sand, iron and pipes.  Mar\u00eda hopes to be able to count on this loan as it is the only way she can improve her and her family's living conditions. Mar\u00eda believes that, with her earnings from her fruit and vegetable business, she will be able to make the monthly repayments for this loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1503320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy cement, bricks, sand, iron and pipes in order to build a septic tank.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-12-31T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":21.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":21.81},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":22.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":23.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":24},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":24.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":26.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":30.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":32.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":32.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T19:19:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":652859,"name":"Ny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ny is 50 years old.

He will also buy stock of frozen food and distribute the products to the local groceries.\r\n\r\nThe family income will significantly increase, and they will be able to improve their standard of living in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1503790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to change the fuel system of his car from petrol to natural gas and start frozen food distribution ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Velistsikhe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-12-31T14:50:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T14:50:28Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gocha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1370},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":799.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":652864,"name":"Faton","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faton is in his early 30s and married.

She is a housewife and lives in a free union relationship. She is the mother of a son who is a minor, and only the three of them live in their home. Their economic income depends on agriculture, plantings of basic foodstuffs such as corn, beans, and coffee. She has four years of experience working with her partner, whom she helps in the field every day, but it was her parents who taught her to work the land at a very early age, since by family tradition they have depended on farm work for generations. The land that they work is their own, and it is located very close to their home, so they walk there to give the needed care so that their crops of basic foods are at 100% for the harvest.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to modernize their plantings of basic foods using a system of drip irrigation, further expand their plantings by purchasing more land, and being able to plant a variety to offer her customers.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, she is now applying for a loan to buy agricultural supplies and use them in maintaining her plantings, which includes fertilizing, weeding, and labor. With the supplies that she will obtain through this loan, Bessy expects to have good production, an excellent bottom line, and in the end, better income for the sustenance of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1503408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies and pay for labor to help care for her plantings of basic foods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-31T17:50:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T17:50:32Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bessy Marleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":22000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T21:52:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653018,"name":"Elsie S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsie S. is 37 years old and live in the Airport area.

They all live in a three-bedroom apartment in Bamenda in the Northwest Region of Cameroon. She has faced so many challenges in life, including inadequate capital to finance a business of her own or cater to her family's needs, sickness, and, worst of all, the death of her family members.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan she will buy groundnut, corn, and farm seedling. She holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has been doing this business for a long time and has regular customers who buy from her.

She has six children.  Two minor children currently live with her, so she stopped working outside the home and started her own business three years ago to be able to take care of them as well as support the household financially.  Her husband works as a day laborer on a nearby farm.  \r\n\r\nBecause of her enterprising spirit she has trained to raise chickens to fatten.  She has enough room on her plot of land, so she's proposing the project to start raising poultry and grow in her micro-enterprise.  Another job is selling cheese, which she buys from a supplier in a neighboring community.  She has managed to diversify her business and help her children with their education.\r\n\r\nEsperanza started with savings and a liquidation from her previous job.  She bought small quantities of cheese and now sells about 40 kilos a week.  She managed to buy a refrigerator for storage and began to train in managing chickens for fattening.  She wants to diversify her business by requesting this loan to invest in this job.

He learned this skill while he was in high school.  Francisco currently is in a relationship and lives with his life companion and their newborn daughter.  <br \/><br \/>Francisco\u2019s work involves making French bread and then selling it in the cantons that are closest to where he lives.  He has been in this business for approximately three years and it has allowed him to earn income for his family.  Francisco learned to make bread thanks to the help of a friend who has a bakery.  In his free time, Francisco would sell bread after school by traveling on his bicycle.  Eventually he learned to make bread, which led to his decision to start his own business.  It was difficult at first because he had no customers.  When he made bread by himself for the first time, he was afraid of burning the bread or some other problem.  Francisco was able to overcome his fear and now this is the only activity to which he devotes his time.  He makes the bread with the help of a brother and then distributes it by traveling in his car and going house to house.  Each day he travels approximately 15 kilometers in order to sell French bread.   <br \/><br \/>The money from the loan will be used to buy supplies for making bread, including eight bags of flour, a case of shortening, and a bag of yeast.  These items are essential for making delicious French bread.  <br \/><br \/>Francisco is a hardworking and responsible person who hopes to improve in the future the premises where his bakery is located.  He also wants to grow his business even more, purchase more supplies, and provide better conditions for his family and his daughter."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1503473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy flour, shortening, and yeast.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-01T08:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-02T08:10:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":17.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":19.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":19.07},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":19.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":21.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":23.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T01:49:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643435,"name":"Sarubala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarubala is a 47-year-old housewife who is illiterate and can only sign her name.
