All the members are known to be happy, friendly, and hard-working. They live in a community where there is a beautiful river with blue pearly water and many of its inhabitants are dedicated to collecting rubber, planting trees, and caring for their farm lands.\r\n\r\nEmeranda is a member of this group. She is 29 years old, studied until the 3rd year of secondary school, and is single. She tells us that a little over 10 years ago, with her parents help, she opened a small grocery store, hoping to earn a little extra money and to avoid having to leave her community to look for work. Emeranda says that when she started out, it was a bit difficult to find customers but, now, she has enough client\u00e8le to cover costs. \r\n\r\nShe always likes to have a good assortment of merchandise in her store so that her customers always find what they are looking for, making it worthwhile to return. Emeranda has expanded her store little by little and will use this loan to purchase crackers, oil, rice, beans, creams, canned chiles, coffee, candles, matches, toilet paper, toothpaste, soap, clorox, soft drinks, and sweets to restock her store. She wants this investment to encourage business growth and to attract more customers.\r\n\r\nThe remaining members of the group are:\r\nRoque who sells groceries\r\nFiliberto who sells groceries\r\nAdrian who sells bread\r\nEsperanza who sells groceries\r\nJulian who sell groceries\r\nDaniela who sells groceries\r\nGuadalupe who is a dressmaker\r\nLuz Elena who sells groceries\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":984431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"buy cooking oil, rice, beans, creams, canned chiles, coffee, candles, matches, toilet paper, toothpaste, soap, clorox, soft drinks, and sweets to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-01-22T20:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roque ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emeranda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filiberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adrian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Luz Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4527.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193944,"comment":null},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6791.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330302,"comment":null},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4527.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044320,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2263.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656512,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T04:51:30Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382676,"name":"Gotitas De Oro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cGOTITAS DE ORO\u201d iniciar\u00e1 su primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del centro focal Los Andes, est\u00e1 compuesta por siete integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva encabezada por la se\u00f1ora Ruth.

The main water run-off system in this area is the Reventazon River, which starts up in the Cueric\u00ed mountain.  Because of the fertility of its land, due to its volcanoes and floodplains, Cartago is a town where agriculture and livestock production are the main economic activities.\r\n\r\nRosibel has been selling clothing for a number of years.  She started out as an intermediary selling merchandise from others, and gradually she has been making her own garments.  But at this time, she lacks the money to make her business expand, which would benefit the neighbors in her community.  So Rosibel is requesting a small loan of 600,000 Costa Rican colones to invest in her business and buy more clothing, since the demand is strong.  Her goal is to have a store in the future that she could fill with merchandise. This would allow Rosibel and her family to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRosibel is a member of the \"Fuente Agricola\" communal bank, one of the 150 such organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan, and with it she hopes to continue to grow, both at the personal and economic level.  In addition, she expects to participate actively in the credit organization in her

Some years ago, she graduated in dressmaking from an academy in the city.\r\n\r\nAna has a sewing workshop in her home, and makes all kinds of clothing; though what she likes best is making children's clothing. She works every day from 8:00am to 8:00pm, but sometimes she stays working until much later, when she has a lot of work to do. \r\n\r\nShe has been in this occupation for more than 12 years, and fortunately has no lack of work.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy fabric, thread, buttons, and other sewing materials.  \r\n\r\nShe has been in the communal bank for four years, and likes it because of the the help and benefits that the institution offers her. Her dream is to have a larger and more mechanized sewing workshop.

They have four adult children. For more than five years Ruperta has worked selling and raising sheep in her town. She began this business to help her husband because his earnings as a day laborer were not enough to cover their household expenses. She will use the loan to purchase five sheep and the animal feed needed to keep them healthy.

She fights every day because she wants her children to move ahead and to be better-off than her.\r\n\r\nDoris currently works as a wine salesperson.  She spends 9 hours working per day, and she can help up to 10 customers each day.  She believes that her business is doing well because she is very kind to her customers and offers them a quality product.  Also, she has the most valuable thing that a person can have: her children.\r\n\r\nDoris is very happy and thankful for the Kiva loaners since thanks to their help, she will be able to buy more merchandise (wine) to be able to have a better inventory and also have more variety in her products.  With this improvement, she will be able to have more income, a better quality of life, and continue saving to fulfill her biggest dream: giving an occupation to her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":985721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"buy more merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-23T02:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":226.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":238.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":244.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":254.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":263.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":273.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.68,"local_amount":226.12,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271227,"comment":null},{"amount":91.26,"local_amount":238.08,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":245.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993875,"comment":null},{"amount":93.56,"local_amount":244.06,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":251.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601781,"comment":null},{"amount":97.56,"local_amount":254.5,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":262.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090898,"comment":null},{"amount":100.95,"local_amount":263.35,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":271.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287221979,"comment":null},{"amount":104.99,"local_amount":273.89,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":282.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298057,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T01:15:15Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382731,"name":"Fidelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n     La se\u00f1ora  Fidelina   vive en una localidad peque\u00f1a  en donde siempre hay  una temperatura calorosa, ella en viudo hace tres meses en la que ya no tiene hijos a su responsabilidad.\n \n    Ella solcito el pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en la compra de  mercanc\u00eda para surtir su  negocio  de abarrotes,  en donde lleva trabajando  dos a\u00f1os seis meses en la que comenta que le va bien.\n\n    Ella inicio esta actividad ya que tambi\u00e9n quiere  apoyar   con los ingresos de la casa y mejorar cada d\u00eda  sus ingresos para su hogar.\n \n     Lo que ella desea es que con esta actividad pueda seguir adelante   a hora que ya est\u00e1 sola  solo con el apoyo de sus   hijos.\n","en":"Fidelina lives in a small town where the temperature is always hot.

His faithful ally in his business is his accordion, with which he plays countless melodies. He works around six hours daily, depending on the number of people who come to the cemetery. \r\n\r\nThe reason he does it, he tells us, is that it is very moving to see people burying their family members, or remembering the year of their passing. But he feels that with his music he can aleviate in part, the pain and sadness that they feel. Sometimes he has cried while he was playing his music, but life goes on, and one has to move forward. \r\n\r\nHe thinks that because of the sensitivity he has, it is going well for him in his business; he understands the pain and suffering that his customers are going through, and that is why he has work. \r\n\r\nEusebio is very happy, and very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to their help he will be able to undetake the paperwork necessary to obtain his certification as a music teacher.

Her husband is Francis, a seaman.  She manages their household while operating the business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to meet their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nImelda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small quantities in the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHPs-worth of cooking oil or a single egg.  Imelda earns money by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community.  She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 9,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a increase in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nImelda hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.  She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and\/or clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":986800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3264.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146170,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":652.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275393,"comment":null},{"amount":135,"local_amount":5400,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5876.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095774,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-20T02:50:26Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:17:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382752,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanita is 53 years old and lives in Talairon, Oroquieta City.

After finishing high school, Yura went to the Kapan technical college and graduated with a diploma in construction. So far Yura is single and lives together with his parents.\r\nYura\u2019s whole family has been doing farm work for seven years. On his own land plot, Yura grows apples for sale. Since his own  plot is small, he also leases [additional] land for growing potatoes for sale, using the rest  as grazing land for his livestock.

is 59 years old and lives with his wife in a ger (Mongolian yurt) in Arhangai province, Mongolia.  His wife helps with his business.  He started his meat and dairy products retailing business in 2003.  He travels across countryside to buy fresh and organic supplies from herders and he sells it to his customers at the market. \r\n\r\nHe is a trusted supplier to many.

She is a hardworking and kind woman.  She started her business with great difficulties.  Previously, Khonbi did not have livestock and had no means to support her family well.

He is married to a trader, and has 4 children aged 12, 9, 6 years and a 10 months old baby, two are school-going children. He has one additional dependent, who lives with him because he helps in the business. In 2005, Osman established his electronics business.  He began his business because of the rebel war that broke in his country of Sierra Leone. Osman says, \"I was in form three (school grade 9 in the U.S) when the rebels attacked us in our village called Sanda twenty miles off from Makeni. Then we fled to Makeni and started working for people for our survival. During that time, I started raising funds until I got a substantial amount to start my business.\" Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,796,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000 . Osman has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan and now needs a new loan in order to buy tape (6 batteries) - 8 pieces @ Lr125,000, radio - 10 pieces @ Le45,000, radio with memory card - 5 pieces @ Le75,000, tape (4 batteries) - 8 pieces @ Le65,000 and electronic lanterns - 1 carton @ Le1,000,000.  The balance will be used for transport. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 269,000. In the future, Osman plans to open a shop. He felt good about taking out this loan as it helps him to boost his business.  He wants his children to have a good education. The loan will help greatly because he will be able to make a profit out of it.  Increases in the cost of goods affects him greatly because as costs change, he has to change his selling prices which affects his customers' buying pattern.  He offers quality products.  Osman serves at least 20 people per day around the city.  His business is popular because he treats his customers fairly and with respect.  He is assisted by family members. He buys his goods in Conakry twice per month and in Freetown once every week.  He saves some of his profit, some he uses to add to his working capital. He plans to expand if he is given subsequent loans that will enable him to accomplish his dreams.

She is a widow and has 1 child aged 24 years. She has 2 additional dependents. In 1980, Isatu established her essential drugs (tablets, syrups, pain killers) business. She began her business because she dropped out of school when she became pregnant by her late husband. Her parents asked her to marry him as they thought it was the best decision.  Since her dreams of going to medical school were shattered, she was given some amount of money after given birth, which she used to start selling medication. Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, she earns about Le 3,585,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. Isatu has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy the following medication: Panadol - 1 carton @ Le440,000, ORS - 1 carton @ Le340,000, hot rubs - 4 bundles @ Le150,000, cold rubs - 2 cartons @ Le150,000, dexoranges - 4 carton @ Le220,000 and haemporte - 2 carton @ Le220,000. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 538,000. In the future, Isatu plans to complete her unfinished building. She felt good as this loan is helping her to improve her business.  She is nervous about the future. She hopes for her adopted children to have a good education.  The loan will serve as another source of income.  \r\n\r\nChanges in government policies such as increases in taxes are her problem, but in terms of competition, it is moderate as she only has one competitor in that area.  She serves patients from the nearby hospital and retailers, about 50 people per day.  Her business is popular because she has good customer care and offers a legal business.  Isatu usually buys her drugs in Freetown twice per month using public transport.  She uses some of her profit for the construction of her house and the rest as additional capital for her business.  She is honest and hardworking. Her business is improving and she hopes to acquire more loans to develop her business.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":987455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"to buy medication for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-01-21T05:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":510416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505738,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":510416.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974843,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":510416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815408,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":510416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444462,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":510416.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537175,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":510416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284645,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T07:24:43Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":383094,"name":"Odette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Odette is 28 years old and single.

She also has a small, home-based store with basic household staples.\r\n\r\nShe asked Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy 200 chicks, 4 quintals of start-up concentrate, 16 quintals of last-stage concentrate and vaccines; to improve the coops and to buy more products for her store.\r\n\r\nShe will buy all of this in a city in the east of the country that\u2019s four and a half kilometers from home.  With this investment she\u2019ll have a better farm and she\u2019ll strengthen her store which will lead to better income.  She will save part of it because she wants to give her family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nLater on, Blanca plans to buy pigs to fatten up and sell, to do some home improvements, to have much more money saved, to meet her community\u2019s needs with her store and the farm because in her areas hers is the only one.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":987492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

She is separated from her husband but lives with her three children in her father's house.  The work she does is selling fast food such as \"salchipollos\" [potatoes, sausage, and fried chicken], roast chicken, and fried wings, as well as a menu and breakfasts to feed the workers in a mechanic shop near her house.\r\n\r\nShe sets up her sales stall in the fa\u00e7ade of her house, from where she has been waiting on her customers very pleasantly for five years.  She also has the help of her sister in food preparation and waiting on the public, and pays her daily for her help.\r\n\r\nShe likes her job because it allows her to have income to pay for the household expenses.  In the past she had an accident that made it impossible for her to work in a company.  When she recovered, seeing the need to have a trade she decided to get started in this business.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling empanadas (a fried treat usually made of meat or cheese encased in fried dough). She will be purchasing cooking oil, flour, meat, cheese, ham, eggs and vegetables. This is a popular food, specially for a snack, breakfast or dinner. She will use the profits to buy school supplies for her children and for saving to one day own her own home. Ana thanks you for your support.

Her dream is to be able to one day have a large business where she makes chipas, so that she can become a distributor and be able to give work to other people. \r\n\r\nHilaria requests a loan to buy starch, lard, eggs, salt and other ingredients to be able to make the chipas that she sells. \r\n\r\nEveryone in the group is very thankful to Kiva and to Fundaci\u00f3n for the opportunity they have received. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":987566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy starch, lard, eggs, salt and other ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Carapegua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.8 -57.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2012-01-23T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blasida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Severiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5072124,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":845354}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257191341,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263327617,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270041628,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276653714,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283143272,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286877554,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T12:56:25Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:13:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":383153,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is 32 years old and lives in Congo Town.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fuamoli joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Fuamoli's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":987810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is forty-seven years of age and is married with three children.\r\n\r\nSesilia owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting taro for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business. Sesilia needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be WST 350 or US $146 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Sesilia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.

is thirty-five years of age and is married with four children.\r\n\r\nTolotea owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting taro for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business.  Tolotea needs a loan of WST 1,400 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 650 talas or US $271 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Tolotea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.

She lives in a simple structure with her three children. She says that her most difficult challenge was to get capital to start a business and to build her house. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying attending church.\r\n\r\nLorenza is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business, where she sells jewelry, by purchasing rings, bracelets, necklaces, and other women's accessories.  She will start her business with this loan, and she is exciting to work and develop her business.
