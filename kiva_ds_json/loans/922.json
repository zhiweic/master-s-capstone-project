She has two milking cows and sells milk in nearby villages. The total average monthly income of the family is 800 Lari.\r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan for purchasing an additional dairy cow and feed. She will purchase hay, which will be used for feeding the cows during the fall and winter seasons. Hay is cheap now and the price increases by 30-40% in the fall months. Irma saves significantly on the costs of feeding the cattle. Since the cows will be fed properly in winter, they will give a planned amount of milk to the family.

The total average monthly income of the family is 300 Laris, which is hardly enough for food for a three members of the family.  \r\n\r\nMadlena requested a loan for purchasing piglets and feed for them.

Her husband is a merchant.

She works three days a week for two to three hours daily. \r\n\r\nShe has to take her young son when she goes selling because she doesn't have any place where to leave him. It's a little uncomfortable but she still does it because what her husband earns is not enough to cover the household expenses. She leaves her products on credit and charges every eight days. She has been doing it for over three years and is doing very well, what she sells more are cosmetics, because they are very good. \r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy clothes, perfumes, creams, and cosmetics.

In 2010, he renovated his mini truck and he plans to continue his business normally in the future. There are four people in his family: he lives with his wife and his two children, a boy and a girl. His wife works as a teacher in the kindergarten and her salary is low. \r\n\r\nSince last year, Batsaikhan has been rebuilding his house and there is still some work to be done to finish it completely. Due to a shortage of money, he has not been replaced the floor, window sills, or wall paper, etc. The main thing he wants to install to his house is electric heating panels to save on the cost of coal and reduce the harmful effects of coal usage. Before, his family used to use a coal-fired stove to warm their home in wintertime.\r\n \r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F), even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems, as well as to buy cars that run on natural gas.  The loan Batsaikhan is taking will be dedicated to covering the cost of electric heating panels and some missing building materials for rebuilding his family house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1870.51,"image":{"id":1164300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Huy has been in this occupation for almost 30 years.\r\n\r\nHuy would like to borrow some funds from lenders to invest in purchasing a large number of cashew nuts, and then she will sell them to other traders for a profit.

With the business she manages, she is in need of additional capital of P8,000, which will be used to buy a variety of merchandise to re-stock her store. She is applying for a loan because her capital intended for her store was used for her hog raising business due to the high price of hog feed and vaccines. She hopes for approval of her requested loan amount.

She is wearing dark brown pants and a brown jacket with orange collar; her purse strap crosses her jacket; and her brown hair is worn down. For 15 years, she has been selling many kinds of new clothing. She works from her house from Monday to Friday, and Saturday and Sunday she manages a vendor stall. Her schedule depends on her availability. She must buy her merchandise in Santiago from stores that offer prices low enough to make her business viable. She will use the loan to buy clothing and accessories such as necklaces, rings, and other items.\r\n\r\nOne of Elsa's goals is to open a boutique in the center of the city where she lives and generate more income to improve her circumstances. She lives with her parents and her 3-year-old son and hopes to open her boutique as soon as possible so that she can help her family financially. She is pleased and grateful for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza because it allows her to invest in her business. She has great confidence in and respect for her communal bank; through her training, she has learned accounting practices and new selling strategies.\r\n\r\nTalca is part of the Maule region located in center of the country. It is the region's administrative, economic, and cultural center and the most important city in Chile's Central Valley. There is an interesting Chilean phrase, \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\" [Talca, Paris, London], which some say comes from  misstating an English phrase \"Talca looks like London,\" referring to fog

They have two children, one of whom lives with them in the home that they purchased 37 years ago.\r\n\r\nTrinidad's parents were artisans, and from a very young age she learned to work with looms, combine colors and weave intricate designs and borders in fabric. \"My father would win craft contests; he was one of the best,\" she says. When Trinidad started her own family, she was working as a farmer. With her income from farming, she bought three looms that she still uses, and began weaving blankets, as well as costumes for folk singers and other events. Her biggest sale days of the year come during the time of the festival to honor the animals and carnivals. During this period of time, Trinidad is constantly taking orders from clients for woven items, and she has to double her efforts to keep up with demand. \r\n\r\nPresently, she wants to open up a juice bar to generate additional income. She is a member of the solidarity group, \"Santiago de Chauca,\" and this is her third loan with MFP. Over the past years she has benefited greatly from loans, as they have helped her to improve her business and learn from her fellow group members, who are like brothers and sisters to her. She promises to continue her history of prompt loan payments.

She has struggled to make a living through farming rice on five hectares of farmland for several years. Besides helping her grow paddy rice, her husband also works as motorcycle repairer locally to earn additional income.

This is the first microloan for Voeurn with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. She is applying for a loan of KHR 2,500,000 to buy fertilizer for her farmland and will use a portion of it to pay for labor costs in transplanting rice.

He used to work in construction but due to health reasons had to leave this type of work and seek a new source of income.  This is how he started to sell fruit and has been earning household income this way for three years.  Despite the fact that this business does not provide the level of economic stability he used to have, his work does allow him to be in good health so he continues working hard to make it grow so that his income will grow too.  Because his customers have been asking him to, Gregorio is looking for a loan to buy an assortment of candy to diversify his sales.  His dream is that the business will allow him to provide his two children with access to a good quality education so that they can get ahead in the future.   He also dreams that his health will allow him to continue working and moving his family

Adem\u00e1s, Pedro sue\u00f1a con que sus hijos tengan una educaci\u00f3n de buena calidad y aspira a que su negocio les pueda pagar esta educaci\u00f3n.\n","en":"Pedro is a very hardworking person with a strong desire to get ahead and provide for his family. He operates a workshop and makes shoes, using the income he generates to support his family. He opened his workshop 20 years ago, and is well known for his high quality work and products. He learned the shoe-making craft from one of his friends who taught him many skills, and, after a time working with and for his friend, he was able to save up some money to purchase basic machinery and open his own shop. His workshop is the source of income for his family, and their hope for a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRecently, he has received many customer orders for shoes, but he does not have the raw materials necessary to fulfill those orders. Therefore, Pedro is requesting this loan, and he plans to use the support from the loan to purchase raw materials for making shoes. He hopes this will help to keep up with client demand and all his present orders.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to expand and grow his business, and to provide for his family and improve their quality of life. Pedro also dreams of giving his children a high quality education, and hopes his business will help them realize their dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1159287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Drought is still the main challenge for her business.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Sokhan with Kiva partner VisionFund. The first loan has helped her relieve family burden and support her childrens' educations. Now she is requesting a loan of 1,000 USD to buy fertilizer for her farmland. She will also use a portion of it to buy a plot of farmland for expanding her rice growing business. She hopes to make more crop yields so as to improve her lifestyle and keep her children in school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":714,"image":{"id":1164474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She has faced many challenges in her life such as the lack of financing to start her business and a low income which makes it difficult to take care of basic needs. Lilian dropped out of school due to the lack of school fees and her mother's death further compounded the situation. She joined GHAPE in 2006 and has seen a light in the horizon due to resources such as cheap and affordable business financing, long loan repayment durations, and life skills and business and marketing training. \r\n\r\nLilian is requesting a loan to buy thread and cloth to use in her dressmaking workshop. She will also use part of her loan to pay for farm labor and buy seedlings, manure, and fertilizer. Lilian thinks that her dress making business will succeed because of her longevity as a seamstress and high demand. Her business will help the community because dresses will be available at cheap prices. There will also be more food items on her farm. Lilian will use the profit from her loan to provide medical care for her family, pay school fees, and expand her dressmaking

She is separated, 45 years old, and has two children who are in school. Due to her separation, she alone is responsible for household expenses. For this reason, she decided to start working with her cousin who had a tire repair business. Despite it being hard work, she performs it in the best way. With time, her cousin left her the business. Little by little, she was buying her own tools until she had a complete workshop where she offers tire service, patches, and second tires. Currently, she has an employee in her charge who helps her with the heavy labor.

He is a very hard-working man who has always been known as honest, responsible, and very happy. He is a man who does everything to make his and his wife\u2019s life better. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 works as a mason and spends most of his time building houses but he also owns a small plot of land. There, he cultivates necessities in the form of staple grains such as beans and rice. He does all this to have a bit of extra salary and to be able to always bring home the daily bread. Besides he also raises livestock which he sells in turn. \r\n\r\nThis way he has some means from where to continue improving his cultivating. But ultimately, he saw the necessity to ask for a loan from INTEGRAL because he has been having problems with the harvest. He needs to buy agricultural ingredients such as insecticides, pesticides and manure among others. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 trusts in God that his harvest will improve.
