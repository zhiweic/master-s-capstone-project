She considers her business profitable because the earnings have helped her through many predicaments, and besides that she is always preparing something for her family, and so avoids food household expenses. \r\n\r\nShe started her business with the desire of having her own earnings and not to depend only on her partner, but to support him with the expenses and to bring a better quality of life to her family. Now she is saving because in the future she wants to open a grocery store at home, in order to be closer to her children during the day. This will be her fourth loan through MFP. She is grateful and happy knowing she has financial support to reach her plans, and she agrees to comply with the payment plan as she did with her previous loans. She also likes the communal bank because of the support they give each other.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested of 1000 soles, she will buy the necessary ingredients in order to make her dishes such as rice, sugar, oil, and more. She will search for low prices in order to have better earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1287461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, sugar, oil and more","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-02T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-04T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":153.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":158.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":164.03},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":176.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.5,"local_amount":153.76,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-19T08:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":157.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123036,"comment":null},{"amount":63.26,"local_amount":158.15,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":162.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868858,"comment":null},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":164.03,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":168.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577698,"comment":null},{"amount":66.07,"local_amount":165.18,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":169.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529929,"comment":null},{"amount":70.53,"local_amount":176.32,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":180.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974959,"comment":null},{"amount":73.02,"local_amount":182.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":187.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996224,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-14T15:23:43Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523768,"name":"Maranatha 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bienvenue, age 50, is married and has two children, 17 and 25 years old.

She is pictured with 10 One Acre Fund farmers, 9 women and 1 man. Margaret is standing on the right with her hand raised. She is receiving an input loan for \u00bd acre of maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. Margaret first enrolled with One Acre Fund during the 2009 Long Rains and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. Margaret joined One Acre Fund in order to access and grow enough food for her family.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Margaret was only able to harvest 1.5 bags of maize per \u00bd acre, but after participating with the One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, she was able to harvest 6 bags per \u00bd acre! She plans on using future profits from the harvest to save for the future and perhaps buy a cow. For the 2013 Long Rains season, Margaret's group members will take input loans of \u00bd acre each. In total, this group will receive input loans for use on 5 acres of land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1287789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bungoma South","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-02-02T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-04T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roseline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Billiha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Priscila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Topista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":55000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":57005.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602615,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-04T21:36:30Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:21:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523824,"name":"Annet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annet is a 40-year-old single mother with three children living in Kasese, Uganda.

He loves his family, which is his main motivation to fight everyday and generate the support to survive. Although he didn't have the resources to start his own business, this did not stop him from achieving his dream of becoming a businessman. With a little money lent to him by a friend, this man started selling fruit and fish at a table that he set up outside his house, with posters to promote his products.

She buys and sells fruits and vegetables: strawberries, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, onions, and chiles, among others. She has had the business for several years, and that has given her a lot of experience, which allows her to obtain the best earnings. The place where she sells is very busy with people and she already has a large clientele who prefer her because her product is fresh, of good quality, and sold at a good price with excellent service. Alba is an entrepreneurial woman, dedicated to her work, with a lot of desire to move ahead, always looking for alternatives that will allow her to achieve success. In recent weeks demand has increased, and she wants to take advantage of it to make a new investment, but she does not have sufficient capital. That is why she is asking Integral for a loan that will allow her to buy wholesale fruit and vegetables. Alba Luz has good payment references and she assures us she will be able to pay off the loan. At the same time she is confident that she will give her family a better

El origen del nombre de la comuna viene del mapudungun (lengua mapuche): \"kila\", que significa \u201ctres\u201d y \"kura\" que significa \u201cpiedra\u201d, por lo que se deduce que el nombre de Quilicura equivale a \"tres piedras\", como  el nombre que le dieron los primeros habitantes de este valle en referencia a los tres cerros que son perfectamente visibles y que delimitan la comuna. \n","en":"This group is called \u201cLos Perseverantes VIP\u201d and is made up of 15 entrepreneurs who have businesses including clothing, cosmetics, and food sales.

This will allow him to prepare orders quickly.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a restaurant and personally provide financially for his family.  What motivates him the most to keep this business is to buy a home of his own because they live at his in-laws\u2019 house.  He is proud to say that his oldest son has a scholarship.\r\n\r\nDaniel is very grateful to the assistance from Fondo Esperanza.  He tells us that they have made it easy for him to grow his small business and grow as a small businessman.  He receives support and has learned important values, and has matured as a person.\r\n\r\nQuilicura is a community that is part of Santiago, the capital of Chile, located in the extreme northeast of the metropolitan region.  The origin of the name comes from Mapudungun (Mapuche language): \u201ckila\u201d means \u201cthree\u201d and \u201ckura\u201d means \u201crock,\u201d from where the name Quilicura is derived.

She lives in the Gurjaani District with her husband and 25-year-old son. \r\n\r\nLeila requested loans from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural start-up business, without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time due to low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only sources of income for the family are the retirement pensions of Leila and her husband and a seasonal income from the family-owned vineyard. It is hardly enough to feed a three-member family. \r\n\r\nAccording to Credo estimates, the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category. Leila requested a loan from Credo to start up a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides for business start-ups, and re-startups.

As he watched his parents run their business, he learned how to properly run a business.  And he helped numerous family and friends with their business plans.\r\n\r\nToday, Emmanuel\u2019s online business, Basket Box, has undergone many transformations. He knew with a broad business name, he could fill gift baskets with almost anything. His latest goal is to sell globally.\r\n\r\n\u201cI began Basket Box in 2004 and the concept then was still with the boxes but incorporated entertainment:  CDs, DVDs and games that would be included with a snack,\u201d he says. That business was strong but not strong enough to keep up with the burdensome prices of media.  He closed in three months.   \r\n\r\nEmmanuel then launched an online job search engine, but over the years, the Basket Box concept continued to interest him.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel conjured different concepts for his business, juggling ideas such as selling fresh fruits and artificial flowers, but the hassle of shipping and handling led him to sell nuts and dried fruits instead. He eventually returned to the concept of offering snacks in a reusable box, which act as bowls. Currently, he sells dried fruit: apples, apricots, peaches, strawberries and bananas, 16 types of nuts, some salted, unsalted and even chocolate-covered.  All are available separately from the boxes and customers may purchase a mix of dried fruit and nuts. \r\n\r\nRecently, Emmanuel introduced an auto delivery subscription for gourmet nuts \u2013 a service through which subscribers receive the same kind of nut every month. Also new to his business, Emmanuel carries bowls and scoops, the sale of which comes with a free small sample of dried fruit. \r\n\r\nWorking in the corporate world for 14 years, Emmanuel got tired of that life and being trapped in the same position. \u201cI\u2019m used to being independent while being at work,\u201d he says. But he\u2019s currently trying to expand his business and become a full-time vendor.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad Accion Texas Inc. is here,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 2004, an absence of capital killed the vision of Basket Box.  Small businesses are typically locked out of banks.\u201d A returning client, Emmanuel learned about Accion through a flier. \u201cI\u2019m dedicating those proceeds to marketing. If I use it wisely, we\u2019ll increase revenue.\u201d He purchased an online radio ad that will air on stations such as Pandora and a list of other similar online radio stations. \r\n\r\n\u201cThis is my third loan. Accion always stayed with me. I\u2019m familiar with the staff, which is easy to work with,\u201d he says, adding that he hopes to hire employees as his business grows.\r\n\r\nFeel free to check out his website:

She says that her business is going quite well and that she is getting more practice now. She does not have much experience and she has been in this business for 3 years, but there are people who have plenty of faith in her. She laughs, \"There are women who tell me I have a good hand for haircuts because their hair grows very quickly, and that makes me more famous.\" She will buy dye, good-quality scissors, peroxide, tubes, and an iron to straighten her clients' hair. She says that she runs her business in her home, but she would love to have a salon with furniture in order to give her clientele a good-quality service. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Mar\u00eda Balbina, Yolanda, Elodia, Rosa, Mar\u00eda Isabel, Mar\u00eda Santos, Jos\u00e9 David, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Diana, and Mar\u00eda Eufemia. They will invest in their businesses, such as a clothing store, raising chickens for sale, a home-style restaurant, selling shoes from a catalog, a grocery store, and the sale of fruits and vegetables, mobile phone accessories, fantasy jewelry, and turkeys."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5500,"image":{"id":1287642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

She also sells winter clothing which she makes herself, such as sweaters, scarves, gloves, hats, and slippers sewn using a hook and needle. \r\n\r\nShe says that she sells clothing depending on the season. When it is hot outside, she sells caps, T-shirts, sandals, and straw hats. She buys some of her merchandise in Mexico City and she makes some herself. She has one daughter, who is studying in primary school. She is very proud of her daughter because she is an above average girl. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan because she would like to stock her business with sewing materials. In the afternoons, she also sells bread on one of the busiest streets in her town, which is called the \"calle de hambre\" (\"street of hunger\") because vendors sell food from their stalls all day long, from six in the morning until one in the morning. \r\n\r\nOne of Clarita's dreams is to have a larger stall, because she cannot fit in everything that she sells and she has to take some things out. The other members of the group are Mariana, Eva de los Milagros, Jos\u00e9 Antonio, Mar\u00eda del Carmen, Eva, Maricela, Marcelino, Lucila, and Esmeralda.

Agustina will invest in feed for her calves, Leocadia, Sara, and Dolores will invest in lambs, Socorro in clothing sales, Rosa and Elena will invest in pigs, and finally Carmen will invest in sweets for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":1287617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed and corn for 10 pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dolores Hidalgo, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-02-03T15:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-05T15:30:01Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leocadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":51000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":12750,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":12752.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199295,"comment":null},{"amount":666.67,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8501.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596088,"comment":null},{"amount":666.66,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8501.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663516,"comment":null},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":12750,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":12752.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048931,"comment":null},{"amount":666.67,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8501.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840101,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T00:23:01Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523908,"name":"Abejitas Trabajadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jaime tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad es originario de una poblaci\u00f3n llena en riqueza hist\u00f3rica llamada Heroica Zitacuaro ya que tres veces fue quemada y volvi\u00f3 a poblarse despu\u00e9s de quemada.

He decided to sell clothing to his friends and acquaintances on credit to help his parents with the household expenses.  He says he goes to the community of Morole\u00f3n because there are clothing factories there and it's more economical, so he can earn some profits.\r\n\r\nHe's requesting a loan to buy clothing for the new spring and summer seasons.

","en":"Mahbuba is married and has 4 children. She earns her living by raising cattle. She has been involved in this business since her early childhood, as her parents' livelihood was fattening cattle. Mahbuba has several head of cattle, and she also has 2 dairy cows. Every morning she sells her neighbours and her acquaintances milk and dairy products such as kefir and cottage cheese that she makes herself. Her son helps her to raise the cattle. Because they live in a rural area, the cows graze in a pasture where her son watches them and leads them home in the evening. Now it is winter and there is practically no grass for the cows to graze on, so Mahbuba has approached Kiva for a loan to buy feed for her livestock. She wants to buy the feed before spring, fatten the cows, and sell them at a good price come spring. She plans to use the loan to buy feed, and she thanks Kiva in advance for the financial support.  \r\n\r\n\r\n

Gulbarchyn plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business and in the children's education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1365,"image":{"id":1286964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase three cows ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Cholok-Kayin village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-02-03T22:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-05T22:00:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulbarchyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":840},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":735}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":25090.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495479,"comment":null},{"amount":840,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":40144.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426784,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T20:41:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523248,"name":"Shahnoza","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0428\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0425\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438. \u0415\u0439 23 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0428\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0428\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b, \u0431\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442.

He did not have the opportunity to get an education and has been involved in animal husbandry since his youth.  When he was growing up, his family had financial difficulties, which is why he has only been raising livestock.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nCyril hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams of having a good and happy family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week.  There, she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1288541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for vegetables and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-02-04T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-06T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cyril","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037282,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781800,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2705.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488690,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1083,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894325,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-04T12:54:40Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":524004,"name":"Alinia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alinia, 44 years old, is widowed and has four children.

He also does landscaping projects.\r\n\r\nHe would like to apply for another loan of 14,000 PHP to buy raw ingredients such as rice, pork, chicken, vegetables and other products needed in his business. The profits from the business will definitely help him to sustain his family's daily needs and his children's educational expenses.

She has been in this business for three years now, and it continues to grow. She is working hard to provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 14,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) loan for her to buy fabric, cloth, thread, and other materials needed in her business. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and her children\u2019s education. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nAnita dreams to have a good and prosperous life and hopes that her business will grow even more. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their lives and businesses every week. It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1288570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To

They have three school-aged children.  Esther and Rogelio have a small sewing shop where they make all kinds of clothing, such as coats, pants, jackets, etc.  They have been in business for ten years and, apparently, the business comes from Esther's side of the family.  But when they married they decided to open their own business.  They take the clothing they produce to Mexico City where they sell it at a good price.

She is 42 and has a son and a daughter, who are both being sent to a private boarding school for a better education. The school is located some 40 kms from her native village. Her husband, who is a peon by profession, works at the village water supply office. His monthly wage (salary) is just enough to manage their children\u2019s boarding school costs. In order to supplement the family income, Jahonghoi has taken up the business of buying and selling firewood. She buys firewood wholesale from one place and sells it retail to different places. Though the business can be expanded, she has to stick to her capacity because she cannot afford it financially. With some profit she earns, she is helping her husband in keeping the family going. This was how she tried to earn income before she accessed loans.\n\nWith some part of her first loan in 2011, she was able to expand her firewood business to some extent. With the remaining part of the loan, she managed to add some more activities to her business like selling vegetables and bananas as she found favorable with time and place. Adding more activities was also quite helpful as they could be done on a daily basis. She still wants to expand her business based on a daily, weekly and monthly basis because she finds that her income flow was better and it also helps her in repaying her loan. In order to keep her business running, she has requested another loan.\n\nThe other group members are engaged with growing and selling spring onions. They have successfully utilized the first loan and have earned benefits financially which help them in generating income to support themselves and their respective families.

Her monthly profit from selling foods is 400 AZN and it increased after obtaining a loan from AqroInvest.  She is a very successful entrepreneur because of a good location in the central bazaar of her home city.  \r\n\r\nThe profit she gains is not enough to reinvest into the business and being able to cover customers' demand is suffering for this reason. Being the main source of income, her profit is used for family needs. Antiqa would like to increase her sales and invest additional capital. For this purpose, she applied for 1,600 AZN.

They have an average age of 45 and, on average, 5 children and all live in the village of Cinzana Gare, the main town of a rural commune in the S\u00e9gou region (4th administrative region of Mali). They got to know each other thanks to neighbourly relationships and their revenue-generating activities. They buy and sell condiments (tomatoes, boxes of tomato concentrate, onions, etc.), cereals, wax cloth pagnes (highly colourful and decorative West African clothing), bed sheets, fruits and vegetables. The members of the group decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso in order to increase their business and are on their 5th group loan cycle.\r\n\r\nKadiatou, commonly called Youma, (the woman sitting on the left in the picture) is a large seller of all sorts of condiments in the village of Cinzare Gare. She plans to use her loan to buy 6 boxes of tomato concentrate, wholesale, at the Bamako Grand Market. She makes her sales for cash or credit from her home and at the village market to a customer base composed mainly of women. Youma hopes to make an average monthly profit of 42 000 francs with the help of this loan, which will be reinvested in her business and used to take care of the household's condiment needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1288666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Uranchimeg, 37 years old, lives with her husband and four children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Her husband had the profession of teacher and now runs a clothing sales business. The clothes he sells are imported from China at a reasonable price, and even though the business has been running just for seven months, it has attracted quite a number of customers. She herself is a senior teacher of linguistics at the university. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair, so she is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to purchase construction materials such as paint, planks and bricks, etc. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable and warm place. More importantly, during winter time, the house will enable the family to use less coal for heating, and that very process contributes to the efforts against air pollution. Also, at this time of year in Mongolia, the price of construction materials is at its lowest, so buying now will spare a considerable amount of money for the family, and this money can be invested in important expenses such as education, food and entertainment.

Here formal economic activities are focused on including work in malls and stores while informal activities occur around them. The local state has relocated them to a commercial plaza where they are now concentrated. Here with their owners, educational action is being taken to formalize their work and improve their productiveness. \r\n\r\nVanessa works here, who since she was very young at 17 years old, began selling goods. Her father strengthened her impetus and gave her seed capital for it. Here she received the encouragement of two friends who made her dream of what has today become her business, where she sells footwear in formal and informal styles. She makes her sales in cash and on a daily basis from 9 am to 9 pm. She makes her purchases in warehouses located in the center of the city and on credit. \r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which she willl buy with cash and in large volume attractive footwear for one of the most important parties of the city. The Barranquilla Carnival comes with an extravagance of color and masks that reflect the ways of the Caribbean people. This is one of the most commercial times of the year in the department of Atl\u00e1ntico. Her goals are to strengthen their business by purchasing in cash and in high volume. This is just the reason why she is applying for a Kiva loan, with which she will buy sandals and flip flops with designs for the happiest time of the year in the city and Colombian Caribbean. Her greatest challenge is to have enough working capital to have sufficient inventory that will help her impress her clientele and selll much more.

His eldest daughter works as a saleswoman in a supermarket, the second-eldest daughter studies at university, and the two youngest children attend high school. His wife, age 53, is a homemaker. \r\n \r\nThe house the family lives in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. Also, since the children are growing each day, the house has reached its capacity in terms of space. For this reason, Mr. Jargalsaikhan is requesting a loan in the amount of 1,500,000 MNT, which he will use to purchase construction materials such as planks, bricks, cement, and dry boards. He will utilize these materials to repair the house and to build a barn. As a result, the family will be able to live in a more comfortable and spacious place. Most importantly, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.\r\n \r\nAt this time of year, the price of construction materials is usually at its lowest, so purchasing them now will save a considerable amount of money for the family.  \r\n \r\nMr. Jargalsaikhan is a very hard-working individual who would like to see all his children successfully employed in the future.

Shamshad is 29 years old, a married woman, running a business of milk sales with the support of her husband. The man shown in the photo is Shamshad\u2019s husband. They have 12 years of experience in the field. They have two buffaloes in milk and sell their milk to many of their neighbors, along with butter and cheese that they make from the milk.  Shamshad looks after the buffaloes and performs the task of collecting milk from them while her husband sells it to different places on daily basis.

Nyamjav, 24 years old, lives with his mother and two brothers in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia.  The brothers have specialized in the construction field and in summertime they render house repair services to local people.\r\n\r\n Since 2012, Mr. Nyamjav has been renting a basement at an apartment and operating billiard and table tennis games there.  He is requesting a loan of 550,000 MNT to pay three months' rental fee in advance. As a result, he can operate his business without worrying about the rental fee.

In search of a source of financing, Marhamat in 2006 began her own business raising livestock, starting with the purchase of a dairy cow. Through hard work, Marhamat's homestead can pull in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Thanks to income from her business, Marhamat today has two heads of cattle and ten heads of sheep. In order to further develop her business, Marhamat appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle. \r\n\r\nMarhamat plans to invest revenue from the loan to further increase the number of domestic animals and to improve the welfare of the family.

She has been in the field for almost 10 years, and up to now she has planned to go out on her own and open her own ice-cream making and soda-fountain business in a space she recently managed to rent.\r\n\r\nTo achieve her goal, she's applying to her financial institution to have the corresponding support.  In the future she hopes to make her business profitable and continue with opening other places in various parts of the region, which she considers difficult but not impossible.  As she says, with work and effort it's possible to move mountains. \r\n\r\nCurrently she wants to have 3,000 nuevos soles [PEN] to supplement her capital and buy decorations, tables, and other things so she can open her own ice cream shop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1288884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is 35 years old and lives in the town of Matuga, in the Luwero region of Uganda. She is married and has two children who are currently in school. For the past ten years, Naku has been working hard to manage her restaurant, which sells cooked food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Naku has requested a loan of UGX 2,000,000 (Ugandan Shillings) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock food and buy tables for the restaurant and will help Naku to generate greater profits and improve on the economic status of her family. Naku hopes that, in the future, she will be able to open up another restaurant. \r\n\r\nNaku is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like Naku, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, like the majority of the people from her village, she was left alone with the problems from that era and she received a parcel of land.\n\nIn search of a source of income, she and her family started their own animal husbandry and field crop farming business in 1993.  Thanks to her hard work, the family's business now consists of two dairy cows, 10 sheep, one calf, three working horses and a parcel of land where they grow potatoes and wheat.\n\nIn order to further develop her business, Bubuazipa has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy some young bulls.  \n\nShe plans to invest part of the proceeds from this loan to feed her livestock while the rest will be used to repair her house.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1286978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

","en":"Hudoyberdi is a 43-year-old man. He is married and has four children. Hudoyberdi is a teacher and works in a school, while his wife stays home and takes care of the children and the household. In addition to his regular job, Hudoyberdi raises livestock. He has been doing this at his home for over 20 years. His teacher's salary is, not surprisingly, insufficient, but the family earns a good income from livestock, which is why Hudoyberdi tries to develop his business.

However, Mamuka\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program provides business start-ups with credit.  The program extends soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products.  They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.  \n\nWith this loan, Mamuka will cover the costs of renovating the store where he will set up a grocery.  He will purchase basic groceries and sell them from his store. Mamuka hopes his business will be profitable and attract many customers from the local community. He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.  Mamuka will work hard and he will be able to improve the living conditions for his family.

He is married and has two children. He and his family live in a village. The whole family works with crop production, and also with livestock breeding. They mainly grow onions, wheat and potatoes. However, Askar's main source of income is from fattening livestock. Every morning his wife milks the cow, which gives up to 10 liters of milk, which she sells to her neighbors and acquaintances. His wife also produces dairy products like yoghurt, cottage cheese and sour cream. \r\n\r\nDuring the season, Askar gets a good harvest and income from growing crops, but currently it is the season for fattening livestock and for income from this type of activity.

It consists of four married women who know one another through family and neighborhood ties.  On average, these women are 30 years old and have three children each.  They run various businesses such as buying and selling condiments and preparing meals, as is the case of Kodie.  In the photo, Kodie is the first person standing from the left.  The group's four women live in large traditional families in the Cercle of Kati (Koulioro region, Republic of Mali).  They have been involved in small retail business for several years and their services are in high demand.\r\n\r\nEager to meet their customers' increasing needs, the members of the group decided to join Soro Yiriwaso's loan program four years ago.  They are now on their sixth solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nKodie, the group's leader, is quite well-known in Ti\u00e9l\u00e9 and she excels at preparing meals.  She intends to use her loan to buy a few bags of rice and various food products and seasonings (pepper, tomatoes, onions, cabbage etc.).  She buys her supplies from wholesalers, locally and in Bamako, and she resells her goods in Ti\u00e9l\u00e9, for cash or on credit, to a retail customer base consisting of men and women.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to make a monthly profit of 25,000 CFA francs, a sum which will allow her to repay her loan and to reinvest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1288739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food supplies for the preparation of meals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Tiele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-02-05T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-07T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kodie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84223.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347180080,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":84223.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922889,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84223.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636435,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":84223.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029920,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84223.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819437,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84223.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678333,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-12T17:35:45Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":524226,"name":"Alba Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Alba Luz tiene 30 a\u00f1os de laborar como docente de la clase de ingles, su esposo es conductor en una empresa de transporte as\u00ed ellos se ayudan para sacar a delante a sus hijos quienes dos ya son independientes solamente uno esta  cargo de ellos quien padece de retraso mental lo cual ha sido dif\u00edcil el cuido y las terapias pero gracias a dios cuenta con el apoyo de un programa que ayudan a personas con capacidades diferentes, do\u00f1a Alba anhela mejorar su vivienda por lo que solicita el cr\u00e9dito para levantar y cambiar el techo de su casa comprando laminas de zinc, perlines y pagara la mano de obra para que su hogar se vea bonito y presentable.

She is the mother of 2 lovely girls, Nicoll who is 4 and Britney who is 2. Her companion is Cesar who is 25 years old. Both of them are dedicated to the family. They live in a home built of wood that they bought a few months ago.\r\n\r\nBecause of the inconveniences of their plots of land they decided to delay their productive activity for later and move together to the city and for Cesar to subsequently work as a motorcycle taxi driver. It\u2019s been a year and she is dedicated to watching over the girls wellbeing while Cesar traverses the various roadways of the city offering the popular service. She is pleased she has a hardworking husband and she is waiting for the time to accumulate enough capital to open a grocery store and thus contribute considerably to the family income. \r\n\r\nWhen the rainy season arrives they hope to buy the above mentioned vehicle and stop renting it and increase their income waiting to fulfill their long term goals.

From a motorcycle taxi stand, he usually seeks for people to provide his service to, and he is also contacted by his frequent customers via phone. Apart from his hardship, he is fortunate to earn approximately 5 USD per day. Hoeun is very delighted that his wife helps him in generating income by raising pigs at home.\r\n\r\nHoeun would like to borrow this amount to buy piglets and feed for the good nutrition of pigs. Hoeun and his wife hope to distribute their pigs into the markets for a higher price when they mature. They will use the profit they will gain from the pigs to reinvest into the pig-raising business and to make some home improvements. Moreover, Hoeun will never forget about the education of his
