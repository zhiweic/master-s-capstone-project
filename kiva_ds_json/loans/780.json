is 25 years old and her husband, Sophea, is 32 years old. They live in a village near the Mekong River about 20 kilometers from Phnom Penh City. They have one young son. Kanha and her husband are farmers; they grow rice and vegetables on their farmland in the village where they live. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Kanha\u2019s husband has motorized hand tiller which he rents out to his neighbors to plow farmland or move things or goods, and gets paid with fees. Unfortunately, the motorized hand tiller is old and breaks (pictured behind Kanha). So Kanha decided to apply for a loan in the amount of 500 USD in order to make the repairs. She will also use a part of the loan to buy an electric saw.
