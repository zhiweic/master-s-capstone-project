She is in a common-law relationship with Juan, who is in the construction business.  They have four children.  Ana lives with her partner and two of her children:  Percy (age 30) and Juan (age 28).  They live in their own home, which they purchased with great effort.  Ana has a business of selling groceries, fresh fish, and bananas.  Every morning, Ana starts early by setting everything out on a table in front of her home.  She attends to her customers, who are mostly neighbors.  Ana started her business 20 years ago with her own capital, but she eventually kept growing as a result of the loans from MFP.  She manages her business with the help of her husband when he has free time and on his days off.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna considers her business to be profitable because her customers buy everything that she offers.  She enjoys her business because it enables her to generate an income to cover her expenses.  Ana has made the effort to travel to other places and meet new people, which will help grow her business.  She does not like the constant rains because they make it difficult for people to reach her house.  Her sales suffer as a result.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her 13th loan with the MFP organization.  Ana hopes to receive assistance so that she can continue with her goals.  She also feels comfortable working with her Communal Bank because she considers her group to be unified and supportive of all its members.  The amount of 1,000 PEN that she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of groceries at a wholesale price so that she can earn more income.  She will also buy fish and bananas to help generate more revenue since the prices of those products are also rising.

However, she\u2019s had the strength to continue forward striving to make progress.  A few years ago she went abroad in search of better economic opportunities but due to the crisis that arose the last few years in European countries she was forced to return to her country and start once more to look for economic progress.  \r\n\r\nThis was how she started a business selling dressmaking supplies; she sells basic supplies like needles and thread among others.  With this business which she opened a short time ago she is able to generate income needed to support herself and to be able to contribute towards her mother\u2019s having a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nBecause she set the business up with very little capital, Luz Maryori is seeking a loan to buy supplies like needles and thread among others for her business so that she can offer her customers a wider variety of products.\r\n\r\nIn this way her business will be more attractive to customers and her sales will increase considerably.  In addition, she will be able to continue having a good quality of life and her family will have access to better economic opportunities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1064421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

Claudia is requesting a loan to repair the roof of her house in order to offer a better quality service and have peace of mind on the job.  \r\nThis way, she will have a safer home to care for the children and provide the parents with peace of mind. \r\n\r\nAlso, this is a way to make her kindergarten more attractive to clients and she\u2019ll be able to continue having this source of income for the maintenance of her household expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1066800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","use":"repair the roof of her house in order to offer a better quality service and have peace of mind on the job.  \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-05-02T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-01T19:00:08Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":56993},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58593},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":60237},{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":61927},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63665},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":65451},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":67288},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":69176},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":71117},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":73113},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75165},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":77275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.52,"local_amount":61512,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":64645.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283327048,"comment":null},{"amount":104.64,"local_amount":176232,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":185208.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378463,"comment":null},{"amount":37.81,"local_amount":63671,"processed_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":66914.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433101,"comment":null},{"amount":90.17,"local_amount":151871,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":159606.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640469,"comment":null},{"amount":29.71,"local_amount":50044,"processed_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":52593.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029556,"comment":null},{"amount":176.15,"local_amount":296670,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":311781.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165663,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-03T00:52:08Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":414009,"name":"Norma Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norma tiene 30 a\u00f1os.

She is also cheerful and friendly.  Martha is in a common-law relationship with Adolfo, who works independently as an electrician and is the father of their three children:  Betsy (age 18), Mariel (age 15), and Fredy (age 6).  They live together in their own home which they purchased with great effort.  Martha's business involves selling different styles of secondhand clothing for women, men, and children.  She acquires her inventory in large amounts thanks to the help of her friend who buys the merchandise and then ships it to her.  Martha sells to her friends and neighbors.  She offers friendly service, thus allowing her to gain customer loyalty.  Martha has been in this business for more than four years and, to this day, her partner helps with finding new customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because the clothes that she buys at very low prices help to generate good earnings.  Martha enjoys her business because she can earn an income and have a career.  She also gets to stay at home and devotes her free time to looking after her children.  Martha wants to increase her inventory so that she can grow her business.  She says that she also knows how to cook, so she plans to start another business in which she sells food.  This will help to generate more income.  \r\n<p>\r\nMartha is receiving her eighth loan from the MFP organization.  She is very pleased to know that she has financial support in order to advance her business.  In addition, she is comfortable working with her Communal Bank because the members are a unified and supportive group.  The amount of 1,500 PEN that she requested will be invested in a large number of secondhand garments so that she will have available stock to sell.  She hopes to get a lower price by purchasing in volume.

She is in a common-law relationship with Isa\u00edas, who is a farmer and the father of their four children: Lu\u00eds (age 23), Paola (age 21), Isamar (age 18), and Anita (age 12).  Paquita lives with her partner and children in their own home.  She sells bananas during the day from a table that is set up in front of her house.  Paquita provides friendly and cordial service to her customers, most of whom are neighbors.  She also sells prepared food such as stews, \"juanes\" (chicken and rice wrapped in a banana leaf), pasta, and other dishes at night in front of her home.  Paquita started her business more than two years ago with a loan from MFP.  With the help of her partner, she has been able to make her business grow.  She considers her business to be profitable because of the good revenue that has been generated.  In order to gain regular customers, Paquita knows that she must invest time into managing her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe enjoys her business because it has enabled her to get out of financial trouble.  Because of their financial needs, Paquita decided that she would help her partner with the household expenses.  However, she dislikes the times when she is not able to sell all of her products due to spoilage, but these moments do not discourage her.  She has done a better job of calculating her purchases and acquiring only what she needs to avoid waste.  Paquita also has plans to grow her business and increase her sales.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her eighth loan with the MFP organization.  Lately she feels that the financial support will help her follow through with her plans.  Paquita is comfortable working with her Communal Bank because she considers her group to be unified and supportive.

In this way she can continue expanding her business and offer her clientele good service. \r\n\r\nAlso, Gloria hopes that her son has the opportunity to have a better education and she wants to provide him with a stable economic future."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1072262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy personal care products in order to meet the large orders that her clients have made","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Retiro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-05-03T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-02T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":65148},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66981},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68866},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70803},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":72795},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":74843},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":76949},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":79114},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":81340},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83628},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":85981},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":88400},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90887},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":93445},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96074},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98777},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":101556},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":104413}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":418042,"name":"Norma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norma raises hogs in the village of Disimuray.

For this reason he always looks for better income and better opportunities for progress for his wife and their four children.  Previously Arbey worked as an employee on a farm where they raised some crops.  From there he began to learn the activity of agriculture; later he studied some agricultural techniques and that is how he began to cultivate sporadically from his home some vegetable crops.

His wife does household tasks and cares for the children. Carlos has been a coffee farmer and seller for 12 years. He learned the job from his father with whom he worked since he was a child. He enjoys the business and now owns his own plantation. His work schedule is from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m., however during coffee harvest season, he works full time and does not follow a particular schedule since there is so much work to do. \r\n\r\nCarlos is applying for this loan in order to purchase fertilizer because he needs it to improve his land so that it will yield a good harvest. The loan would help greatly since previously he had to pledge his coffee to intermediaries beforehand, who paid him a lower price and took advantage of his need for money before the harvest. One of his dreams is to produce more coffee and thus generate higher sales. This is his first loan with FAMA and he expects to make all of his payments on time.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1072466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Patuca, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-05-03T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-02T01:10:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":416078,"name":"Florcita Judith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Florcita tiene 40 a\u00f1os, naci\u00f3 en Jipijapa recinto de Manab\u00ed.

She is married to Manuel Loor and has two children ages 5 and 8.  Since her husband is a factory worker and lives in Guayaquil she left her native land.  8 years ago they began construction of their house, which they have not been able to complete for lack of economic means.  She decided to begin her business out of necessity since she did not have work.  At the beginning she sold candy, snacks and sodas, but over the years her business prospered.  Today she no longer sells from the living room of her home.  She has a shop, purchased a copier and started her bazaar.  She tells us that she has a schedule from 6am to 10pm, and that she is tired but it allows her to be with her children who attend school.  As her husband is a factory worker she works alone.  This worries her since she has become vulnerable to delinquency.  The loan will be used to purchase products for the store, like stationary and candies to increase business.

She loves doing this type of business since she is a low-educated woman who only finished primary school level. She, together with her husband, has committed to work hard because they want to provide a good education to their children. Presently, five of them are married and have independent lives, living separately around the province, while the remaining one is still a student.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of a vehicle for home use, Hul is experiencing difficulties in using other transportation services.

After some time he was able to become independent and began to cultivate his own plantation. The work schedule is varied. During the harvest season one works hard without rest. \r\n\r\nTo date, the difficulties that Marlon has faced are the scarcity of manual labor for the coffee harvest, since everyone is doing the same work at the same time. Another inconvenience is the transferral of the coffee to the point of sale, since due to the bad state of the roads\u2014a product of the winter rains\u2014it is difficult to transport the product. \r\n\r\nMarlon intends to use the loan he is requesting to buy fertilizers and pay the workers who maintain the plantation. The loan would help him considerably, since before he had to pledge the crop to intermediaries who would take advantage of him to pay a low price for the coffee. One of Marlon's goals is to introduce modern technology to his plantation and to have the proper tools to expedite the work.

Two of her children work: one works in the construction industry and her daughter does domestic work.  Thanks to God, they do not have any health problems but they do have financial problems as Marlen would like to have a nice, painted house made from blocks (her house is currently made from planks of wood).  She would also like to have better financial solvency so that she can help her children with their studies and offer them a better future.  Twelve years ago, Marlen started working with a small grocery store.  Then, a family member helped her to acquire premises so that she could start a business selling fruit and vegetables.  She currently works in this business.  She works together with one of her daughters who helps her to serve in the business.  Her opening hours are 8.00am to 6.00pm.  One of her advantages she has is that she has a lot of customers but sometimes her produce spoils and she loses her investment.  \r\n\r\nMarlen needs the loan that she is requesting to buy fruit and vegetables such as watermelons, grapes, mangoes, bananas, avocados, melons, chilis, onions, tomatoes, peppers, cabbage, lettuce, etc.  With the support of this loan, Marlen will be able to stock her business and continue having a source of income with which to support her children.

About one year ago, Catalina opened a store selling natural health products, such as capsules made from plants and roots.

A pesar de eso ellos desean incrementar ese margen de ganancias, ya que no pueden comprar como antes debido a que no cuentan con el dinero para hacerlo.\n\nElla compra los productos en los cantones cercanos al lugar donde vive a distintas personas, pero como el precio de venta no es el mismo, ella tiene que comprar as\u00ed y despu\u00e9s venderlo a un precio considerable en el cual ella no pierda a la hora de venderlo.

However, since the sale price is not the same, she has to buy in this way and later sell as a considerable price so she will not make a loss at the time of the sale. To buy her dairy products, she goes on foot to the vendors, since there is no public transportation in this place. At time she has to walk for kilometers to reach their homes, and later she comes back carrying the products herself. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in buying greater quantities of cheese, curds and cream. Currently, she can only buy 75 pounds of cheese, 30 pounds of curds and 50 bottles of cream per week, and Arcadia would like to buy the double amount of each product, because she has a lot of customers and she is not able to stock up because of a lack of funds. With this investment, she will improve her income and her sales will increase, because her customers will be satisfied since they will always find fresh products at her home. \r\n\r\nArcadia wants to have a better quality of life, with the sale of dairy products to help her husband cover all of the expenses of their household. Both are at an advanced age, but they still have a determined spirit to keep working. Because agricultural work is very heavy, the sale of dairy products is easier for her, and they also benefit from the help of the municipal authorities, who have given them a shop where they can sell their products.

They are blessed with two children, who are Roshellin \u2013 29 years old and a commerce graduate, and Caren Joy \u2013 20 years old and currently a high school freshman. With a good relationship in the family, Merlita is really inspired in pursuing the business she started because she wants to finance her youngest daughter's college education. They live in the Ilagan municipality. Merlita shared also that the village where they live is a faraway rural place and mountainous.\r\n\r\nMerlita wants to request loan assistance for her rice vending business, amounting to PHP 35,000, that will be very helpful to her business. According to her, the loan will be used to purchase sacks of rice and animal feed for her business since they are in demand.

The advantage Jos\u00e9 enjoys is that coffee growing gives him good income, which is what he uses to support his family. The problem he faces is that there is no access for vehicles, since he lives on a mountain, and it is difficult to transport his products. Jos\u00e9 is requesting the loan to buy compost and fertilizer and to pay for labor during the coffee harvest season. These loans have helped him greatly, since he bought a machine to grind coffee, and this has brought substantial benefits to his family. His dreams include expanding his coffee production, having his house in better condition, and seeing his children become professionals.
