","en":"Nilufar is 22 years old and married, but she and her husband don't have children.  Thanks to her parents, she went to a medical college and she now is working as a nurse in the local hospital.  She loves her job very much and performs it with pleasure.  \r\n\r\nShe married in February of this year.  Her husband is a very good man, but he doesn't have stable work.  Nilufar earns a modest salary and it is very difficult for her to cover all their expenses by herself.

He lives in a small village in Martvili District with his two children and two grandchildren. Tariel requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows and a calf. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land with 100 nut trees. They sell the dairy products and harvested nuts at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTariel requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Tariel has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Tariel will rent an auto workshop and will work as an artisan to repair cars. He will purchase equipment and pay the rent. He will work hard to increase the monthly income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":316.95,"image":{"id":1334782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to rent an auto workshop and purchase equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Khuntsi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-21T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-21T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tariel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":72.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.26,"local_amount":66.01,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":68.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969182,"comment":null},{"amount":36.05,"local_amount":57.68,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":59.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749602,"comment":null},{"amount":37.45,"local_amount":59.93,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":62.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613508,"comment":null},{"amount":38.13,"local_amount":61,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857225,"comment":null},{"amount":39.2,"local_amount":62.72,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":64.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133878,"comment":null},{"amount":40.59,"local_amount":64.94,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107465,"comment":null},{"amount":41.45,"local_amount":66.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":68.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255014,"comment":null},{"amount":42.82,"local_amount":68.52,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":70.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019165,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-22T06:16:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":550099,"name":"Poli Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Poli is a 45-year-old responsible housewife.

At the time of his diagnosis, drug options were very limited and he began looking for other medical alternatives. When he discovered acupuncture, Rob was enamored by the healing qualities of the treatment. But when his insurance coverage ran out and he could no longer receive treatment, he arrived at two conclusions: first, that he wanted to return to school to study acupuncture; and second, that he was going to develop a business model that would offer affordable acupuncture treatment to individuals who don\u2019t have health insurance.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rob began his own business, <i>City Acupuncture<\/i>. In addition to offering acupuncture treatments, his company also offers massages and sells herbal teas and remedies.

However, located in the Wall Street area of New York City, Rob\u2019s business lost power when Hurricane Sandy hit in October 2012. Rob was forced to close his business until the electricity was restored and, even after reopening, many of Rob\u2019s clients were unable to afford or attend their appointments during the aftermath of the storm. After Sandy, Rob realized the importance of offering acupuncture insurance to his clients.

She is married to Delfin, a purchaser, and mother to their children. She and her husband manage their household while operating a business. They are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nJonalyn maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nJonalyn hopes to have more customers and dreams to have their own house and lot. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week.

In Lebanon, taxi drivers suffer from a very bad financial situation, since fuel is very expensive and the government is not supporting them or setting special rules for exceeding the number of taxi drivers in the region, which results in low income work for them.\r\n\r\nAhmad is applying for his fifth loan cycle from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua. His previous loans were invested in doing necessary maintenance on his car and answering most of his family's needs. Today, unfortunately, his loan will be to pay for his wife's medication. He puts in so much effort to cover everything she might need.\r\n\r\nAhmad is so pleased that he found Al Majmoua to stand by his side and meet his needs, since no one lends to the working sector in Lebanon. He hopes to buy a new developed car in the future.

is 41 years old and lives in the town of Masidi in the Hoima region of Uganda. She is married and has 8 children, 4 of whom are currently in school. For the past 8 years, Ruth has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soap, sugar, milk and bread. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Ruth has requested a loan of 2000000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more items such as rice, maize flour and soda to sell, and will help Ruth to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Ruth hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nRuth is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

All the hopes and aspirations which she dreamt of with her husband were shattered and tumbled. In spite of all the hardships she faces, Hatshi manages to take care of all her kids by running small income-generating activities like selling rice from door-to-door, selling vegetables and by working in someone else's paddy fields to earn a daily wage.\r\n\r\nThe group is named after Hoikhotin because she was a well known lady in the surrounding areas for her hard work and endurance while she was serving as the only female chief in the village. A member of the group says that she is their inspiration and they look up to her for success. They are proud to call themselves Hoikhotin Group.\r\n\r\nHatshi works really hard to manage the family affairs. Besides selling rice, vegetables and earning a daily wage by working in paddy fields, she also weaves to supplement her income. She taught her second daughter weaving, and now she and her daughter co-operate and weave different traditional woven products. She is able to make a good profit now, but it is never sufficient to make savings. She has to repay the loan amount monthly and also her kids' needs are to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, Hatshi is planning to get sufficient yarns from the market to use for weaving. She has decided to buy the better quality yarns, which she could not afford before, and weave the most expensive traditional wrap skirts for women to sell for a good profit. She wishes to continue her weaving business because she can carry it out irrespective of the weather. Her other activities are affected when there is a bandh [strike] in the area or when it rains heavily. Her dream is to provide her youngest daughter with the best education and support her in all possible ways to let her become an IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officer, which is considered the highest civil service in India.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are engaged in poultry, a piggery, a grocery and vegetable vending. Hatshi thanks Kiva and WSDS for the help and wishes to continue working with WSDS and Kiva. She says, \u201cGod will help and guide you and will never leave you. God bless Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1334683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to

is a 30-year-old single woman who lives in poor conditions in Taiz, Yemen.

The intention behind this institute is not only to get money, but to help youth who like to learn develop their skills. She is the breadwinner for her family where she strives to provide household expenses. She intends to furnish her institute but unfortunately, the amount she saved is insufficient to buy what she needs.

Duajhar is a rural village in the Nuapada district of Odisha, India. The group was formed in the year 2009 and consists of four women members who belong to the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category.  Dalimba, sitting second from left with her hand raised in the photograph, is one of the members. She is 32 years old and lives with her husband, one son of 13 years and one daughter of 9 years who are studying in standard 8th and 5th, respectively, in the school in her village.\n\nDalimba has been running a photography and video shooting center in a small rented cabin in her village for the last 11 years with the help of her husband. Apart from this business, her husband is also running a photocopy center in another location. Presently, Dalimba has a computer system, three small digital cameras and two normal video cameras for her business. In the absence of her husband, Dalimba also manages the photo studio. Apart from indoor service, her husband attends outside calls from various social festivals, government programmes and other functions for photography and video shooting. Dalimba earns 6,000 \u2013 7,000 INR per month. This is the fourth loan for Dalimba from Mahashakti Foundation. With the previous three loans, she has added some new assets to help her business. Dalimba says with the first loan, she purchased a screen and a focus light and decorated her studio. With the second loan, she purchased a video camera and with the third loan, her husband purchased a bike to help him in his mobility for outdoor video shooting. This gradual development helped her to increase her income. Presently, Dalimba is earning a monthly income of 6,000 to 7000 INR per month. But this amount is also not sufficient to meet her expenses like house rent, the educational expenses of her children and payment of the workers. So she is planning to increase her income by adding some more assets to her business. With the present loan, Dalimba is planning to purchase another computer and a video camera for expansion of her business. Dalimba's location has a great potential for her business but, due to the shortage of space, she is not able to expand it the way she wants. Dalimba dreams of constructing a photo studio of her own in a central place and giving a better education to her children. \n\nThe other three members of her group are Bhagya, Padmini and Sumati who are doing a fruits and daily need business, a puffed rice business and a general grocery shop with fruits shop and paddy business.\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1332031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a computer and a video camera","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Duajhar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:01Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhagya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dalimba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":96000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":96000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-23T06:18:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":548617,"name":"Majd","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Majd is a 32-year-old married man and has two children.

","en":"Gayratjon is a young, energetic guy, 26 years of age.  He's not yet married and lives with his parents.  Gayratjon lives by the principle of not marrying until he himself has not saved up enough money for his own wedding.  He's a very hardworking and hospitable person.  \n\nFor nine years he has bought and sold nuts with his mother.

","en":"Ayora is an intelligent and hard-working woman. She is 24 years old, single, and lives with her parents. After graduating from high school, Ayora entered the Tajik State University. Following graduation as a software programmer with excellent marks, she stayed at the university and has now worked there as a programmer for over 7 months.

She lives in the Khashuri District with her husband, three children and her parents-in-law. Her mother-in-law is provided with a retirement pension. Natia has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a small monthly salary earned by Natia\u2019s husband, working as a driver at a private company. It is hardly enough to pay for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNatia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this loan Natia will begin a trade selling used clothing. She plans to purchase used clothing from the wholesalers and then resell at a higher price. This will increase the income of the family.

Two years ago, Eloisa got the idea of going into sales and she opened her own business selling various items like cosmetics (powder, blush, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick), stationery supplies (construction paper, printer paper, folders and other school supplies) and some personal use items (hair bands and hair clips) and a wide variety of items including even table games like Parcheesi.  She sells in small amounts because she does not have much space or much capital to keep a large inventory.  Because of this, Eloisa is requesting a 5,300 pesos loan because with such an investment she\u2019ll have more merchandise to sell which will result in higher income.

is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband Marwan appears in her Kiva profile photo, with the picture inside the furniture store.\r\n\r\nRanda is a 31-year-old young married woman and a mother to two sons and one daughter. Randa's husband is employed and gets a low salary, which is the only source of income for the family and not quite enough to cover all their needs.\r\n\r\nRanda is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing new bedroom furniture in order to improve the living conditions of her children in her house. Taking this loan will offer Randa's children comfortable and suitable furniture so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband, Mohammad, appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nLubna is a 30-year-old, married, young woman and a mother to two sons and two daughters. Lubna's husband is employed and gets a low salary that is not enough to cover all the family's needs.\r\n\r\nLubna is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from Palestine for Credit & Development (FATEN) to help her cover the cost of purchasing new living room furniture in order to improve the living conditions of her family in the house. Taking this loan will offer to Lubna's family comfortable furniture, so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see in fund-raising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

This is his first loan with FUDECOSUR, and he has never taken out other loans with state banks. It is easier for him to get a loan with FUDECOSUR and the interest rate is much lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1.75,"image":{"id":1337836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy supplies for coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Bello Oriente, Agua Buena, Coto Brus","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2013-04-22T17:50:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-22T17:50:25Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arcadio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1.16,"local_amount":551.81,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":577.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813412,"comment":null},{"amount":0.59,"local_amount":281.8,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T10:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":295.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059280,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-24T00:00:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":551888,"name":"Asuncion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Asunci\u00f3n, de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casado y tiene dos hijos de 17 y 9 a\u00f1os, vive en el terreno de su madre.El trabajo de Asunci\u00f3n consiste en la venta de ropas como polos, pantalones, blusas y diversos cosm\u00e9ticos como perfumes, cremas faciales y corporales.

He is married and has one daughter and one son. His wife is a homemaker. Baba breeds cattle to sell to local butchers and raises cows for their milk and milk products. In this business his wife also helps him. His work is the only financial income for his family.\r\n\r\nBaba has ten years of experience with livestock, thanks to his father who taught him the best way to look after his animals. He usually buys young cattle, raises and fattens them for five to six months and then sells them at a profit in the local livestock bazaar. He also sells milk and yoghurt to his neighbors. All together, these activities bring in 180 AZN a month but are not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children.
