En un principio contaba con muy peque\u00f1os ahorros y por eso compr\u00f3 una res muy peque\u00f1a, pero poco a poco fue sacando el negocio adelante y ahora puede tener mejores ingresos. Como tiene 2 clientes que le est\u00e1n haciendo un pedido, pero no tiene el capital suficiente, Henoc busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar 2 caballos y responder a los pedidos de sus clientes.\n\nHenoc espera seguir mejorando el negocio poco a poco y seguir ofreciendo en su hogar una mejor calidad de vida. Su sue\u00f1o es que los ingresos que recibe le permitan terminar de construir su casa que la tiene en obra negra, y as\u00ed ofrecer a su esposa y sus hijos un buen hogar. \n","en":"Approximately ten years ago, Henoc began his business selling animals, which he learned empirically.  This is how he has been able to take care of his family.  In the beginning, he could save very little, and this is why he bought a very small cow.  But little by little, he got ahead with his business, and now he has better income.  He has two customers that have given him orders, but he doesn't have enough capital.  Henoc is looking for a loan to buy two horses to respond to his customers' orders.  He hopes to keep improving his business little by little and to keep offering a better quality of life in his home.  His dream is that the income he receives lets him finish building his house, which is under construction, so he can offer his wife and children a good home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":681.22,"image":{"id":1204949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

For the past 15 years, Aisha has been working hard to manage her clothes and garment shop, which sells blankets, bedcovers, and towels. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Aisha has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more items like towels, bedcovers, sweaters, and blankets and will help Aisha to generate greater profits and increase the family's income and standard of living. Aisha hopes that in the future she will be able to keep growing the business. \r\n\r\nAisha is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

existing resources. Saodat is one such person who is trying to improve her living standard and jump-start the economic situation of her family. She is divorced and has two children at home. Her husband is now re-married to another woman and has left to live in the Russian Federation. Saodat used to bake pies which her children sold at the bazaar, but her income from this business was small so she learned how to sew \"kurpacha,\" or traditional national blankets. She also took a course entitled \"To Get Ahead\" that was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate. Now Saodat is fully capable of organizing her own business and becoming successful at it. She wants to set up a business sewing and selling national blankets.

Mert resides in a rural area of the Ratanak Mondul district of Battambang province in Cambodia and makes a living by growing corn on a three-hectare area of farmland. Having been in this business for eight years, she is able to earn about 20,000 KHR per day and save about 10,000 KHR each day after offsetting daily expenses. Drought is the main challenge for her corn business.\r\n\r\nMert has been with VisionFund for one cycle and completely paid back the past loan. The other group members are first-cycle clients with VisionFund. Mert's first loan has helped her to relieve her family\u2019s burden and improve their livelihood.

She is not married, but she lived many years with a man that she loved, with whom she had 12 children.  When they separated Blanca worked hard to keep her family moving forward on her own.  Today her children are adults and independent.  She lives in her own house with one of her children and a grandson and granddaughter.  Blanca runs a grocery store from her house, from which she attends to her clients, most of whom are her neighbors, in a friendly and cordial way.  She sells important household products such as rice, bread, milk, eggs, vegetables, etc.  Since most of the products are perishable she renews her inventory every week and spends about 100 to 150 soles each time.  She has been running this business for about 3 years by herself.  She also sells various medicinal drinks made from the roots and bark of trees from the Amazon, which she has been doing for 5 years.  She likes her business because it allows her to be in her house and at ease because of the income, she is also able to employ people to work in her home.  She does not like it when her clients want to run a tab in her store because in the past she has had bad experiences with people not paying.  However, after seeing the good results from her experiences she is planning to expand her business.  She also wants to acquire a mototaxi in order to rent it out and make more money.  This is her 9th loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has the support from them so she can continue working worry free.  For her part, she will continue to make punctual payments as she has always done.  She feels comfortable belonging to a community bank because all of the members are responsible and caring.  With the 1000 soles that she is asking for she will buy more merchandise to continue selling.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1207024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase important household products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":155.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":151.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":164.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":170.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":173.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":183.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.4,"local_amount":155.99,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":162.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447671,"comment":null},{"amount":60.43,"local_amount":151.09,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":157.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053569,"comment":null},{"amount":65.9,"local_amount":164.74,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":171.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188507,"comment":null},{"amount":68.35,"local_amount":170.89,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":177.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572422,"comment":null},{"amount":69.55,"local_amount":173.86,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":180.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122084,"comment":null},{"amount":73.37,"local_amount":183.43,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":190.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867903,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-16T09:24:53Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":477878,"name":"Gertrude","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gertrude lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She lives with her husband, Arturo, and three of their five children: Patricia, Teresa, and Piero, whom she cares for in the house that she inherited 27 years ago. She has 18 years of experience in raising animals and in growing potatoes, carrots, corn, and alfalfa, which serve to increase her earnings. All her family participates actively in these activities, which are considered family businesses. It is for this reason that in the mornings she goes out to take her animals to graze in the fields, and at her house she also feeds them the alfalfa that she gets from her cultivated land. After a number of months she sells her animals, the majority of which are bulls, either alive or butchered, from which she gets more earnings. Another way she has to generate income is renting out her bulls for plowing. It is for this reason that she aspires in the future to have more head of cattle. For now she is concentrating on planting, since she already has orders to send to the capital of the country. She belongs to the communal bank \"Sicaya 2000,\" and this is her 10th loan from MFP. She feels happy since during this time she succeeded in obtaining good earnings, all thanks to the economic help that they offered her. For this reason she promises to make her payments. In addition, she likes to work in her association, where the members are united and hard-working people.

Her business is located in a strategic place, because it is in a main street of the community and this makes it very busy.\r\n\r\nLesbia needs the loan to buy: corn, meat, dairy, poultry, soft drinks, sugar, oil, butter, soap, eggs, bread, etc. The expected impact of the credit is an increase of sales, because she will buy a great variety of products, thus meeting the needs of each of her customers.\r\n\r\nThe future plans for Lesbia are to keep growing her business, as well as to generate good income, and to give a good education to her daughter and a better quality of life.

The organization works to offer reliable, efficient, and affordable technologies to households to improve their livelihoods. \n\nWork in this sector began at SOSAI in 2010. The organisation had existed as a fully commercial company before this, but now we operate as a social enterprise. \n\nSOSAI was set up by Habiba, who is a founder, and who had worked for Developmental Association for Renewable Energies (DARE), where she had got the opportunity to carry out exhibitions and workshops for people in rural areas and urban slums highlighting the benefits of renewable energies. Because DARE is an NGO sales were limited by DARE, so Habiba decided to branch out to revive SOSAI. With benefitting people at the forefront, running this organisation as a social enterprise was paramount. \n\nThe idea behind the project of creating micro-enterprise by providing solar lighting is to empower small entrepreneurs who can penetrate more communities by giving them the opportunity to buy products and pay for them in installments, with an agreed upon plan and model. This will develop micro-enterprise, especially for women, while ensuring that a large number of people get all-important lighting into their homes, at the same time empowering more by giving them a means of livelihood. With the high number of households not connected to the grid--despite its rich energy resources--Nigeria is a fertile ground to grow this business as in the past 10 years (in spite of the government's promises) the power sector has only worsened with more power cuts and fewer people being connected to the grid. \n\nAccording to the WHO 1.6 million deaths occur yearly from indoor air pollution; this project will in the long run reduce green-house gas emissions while improving maternal health and ensuring basic education as longer study hours will be ensured. \n\nBenefits accruable to using Solar Home Systems as provided by Barefoot Power are immense, but the most important reason for SOSAI undertaking this comes from a personal experience Habiba has had with kerosene lamps while assisting her mother who owned a \"Bukka,\" a term used to describe a small eatery, where they worked till late at night using kerosene lamps. Her mother currently has an eye problem because of the exposure to indoor air pollution and Habiba herself wears glasses. What better drive to promote a cleaner source of lighting than personal experience? \n\nThe business model will be fully developed to include training for the business owners and training of technical staff that will ensure the warranty Barefoot Power prides itself in. \n\nThis loan will enable SOSAI to better promote this sales model and move deeper into the rural areas especially to give the organization the strength to be able to fall back and take on the steam at any time. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":22975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1249366,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2769,"youtubeId":"8sx18jjZOCQ","title":"Kiva Borrower Habiba from Nigeria","thumbnailImageId":1249366},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To sell solar lighting to people who don't have electricity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T09:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T09:00:07Z","loan_amount":22975,"lender_count":710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Habiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":22975,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":22975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6975},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6975},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10000,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":10000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419778967,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-08T20:49:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":480424,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel works for NRG Solution, a Barefoot Power distributor in Cambodia. \n\nThis is his story: \n\nI came to Cambodia three years ago and saw the desperate need for basic access to electricity. With 80% of the population not having access to any kind of distributed electricity there was a lot of potential to improve people's lives by giving them access to basic electricity. Most people depend on car batteries and kerosene lights, which is inadequate, inefficient, labor intensive, and unsafe. \n\nNRG Solutions was established with the goal of providing sustainable, appropriate, and affordable solar energy solutions to Cambodia and S.E. Asia. Our team began working under the name Yejj Solar, as part of a larger NGO. This experience helped us learn about the local and regional market. We tested different models and approaches to the distribution of solar energy into remote areas. Earlier this year we decided to transition out of the NGO model into a social enterprise model, in order to improve sustainability as we saw the need to scale up. Our approach has two fundamental pillars: quality and service. We have slowly introduced Barefoot Power products in order to build the brand and trust in the products. By building a network of entrepreneurs to which we offer constant training and support we are pushing this emphasis of quality and service down to the end customer. This has quickly allowed us to differentiate ourselves from distributors of cheaper products with no after-sales service. \n\nYour contributions will help us bring much needed stock in order to meet the large demand and grow the business. This stock will then be given to local entrepreneurs we have trained to sell these products in very remote areas of the country, where they are most needed. This loan will help us in that final push to establish our business and the Barefoot Power products into a known and trusted brand. The largest challenge with solar energy in Cambodia is the lack of trust due to the availability of very cheap, low quality products, and no after-sales service support. Barefoot Power provides the best quality and easiest-to-service products in the market. \n\nOur efforts and patience in building trust in our brand have recently and quickly translated into larger and larger demand. We are currently not able to meet demand due to lack of funds to place larger orders, which can be solved with initial financing. We envision a network of entrepreneurs all over the country reaching the most remote and needed families, in order to make a significant difference in their lives with reliable, adequate, modern, and green energy. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":16000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1202547,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2753,"youtubeId":"pu4Rg5qgc6k","title":"Kiva Borrower Daniel from Cambodia","thumbnailImageId":1202547},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To sell renewable solar lighting ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Phnom Penh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.55 104.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T09:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T09:10:01Z","loan_amount":16000,"lender_count":501,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":16000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":11200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419778966,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-10T16:42:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":480828,"name":"Dossou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr Dossou est un jeune commer\u00e7ant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 29ans.

He has been living together with his mom in her home for the past 10 years.  Armando owns two plots of farmland where he grows a number of different crops such as potatoes, barley, oats, hay and red clover.  Over the years, he gained a lot of buyers which led to him not being able to produce enough to meet demand.  For this reason, he started renting additional land so that he could produce more.  He has 20 years experience not only in farming but also in cattle farming as he buys and sells cattle.  He has two cows and one bull.  On market days he travels to the cities of Chupaca and Jauja to sell his animals.  \"If I sell my animals in the village my profits are minimal so I travel to the cities because I make more money there.  It's the same with my crops which I sell in the capital.  I hire a truck and I do the journey myself\", he says.\r\n\r\nThis is Armando's fourth loan from MFP and he is grateful for the support that he has received over the years as it has helped him to make progress and improve the capital he has available for his business activities.  For this reason, he pledges to be punctual in making his repayments as he was with his previous loans.  Armando will invest the money he has requested in buying 200 sacks of natural fertilizers to spread over his next crop of potatoes.  He will also buy an additional cow so that he can continue making progress in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1205170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 200 sacks of fertilizer and a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":451.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":453.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":473.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":487.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":502.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":529.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":543.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":559.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":174.83,"local_amount":451.18,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":453.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447695,"comment":null},{"amount":175.66,"local_amount":453.32,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":455.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053596,"comment":null},{"amount":183.51,"local_amount":473.56,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":476.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188533,"comment":null},{"amount":188.77,"local_amount":487.14,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":489.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572447,"comment":null},{"amount":194.66,"local_amount":502.37,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":505.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122109,"comment":null},{"amount":205.03,"local_amount":529.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":532.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867926,"comment":null},{"amount":210.75,"local_amount":543.88,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":547.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576834,"comment":null},{"amount":216.79,"local_amount":559.45,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":562.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529178,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-29T21:09:21Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":478124,"name":"Union Y  Esfuerzo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Grupos solidario formado por tres socios microempresarias exitosa que tienen diferentes actividades como do\u00f1a C\u00e1ndida que se dedica a la venta de nacatamales y pan desde hace dos a\u00f1os, adem\u00e1s tiene animales de patio como 20 gallinas, 6 patos, y 6 chompipes.(pavo)\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo utilizara en la compra de cerdo, hojas, arroz, le\u00f1a, especies, sal, papas etc. y compra de alimentos para sus animales de patios.\nDo\u00f1a Mercedes se dedica a la venta de nacatamales desde hace 7 a\u00f1os en su domicilio, do\u00f1a Br\u00edgida hace sopas los fines de semanas, en su domicilio\n \n","en":"This solidarity group is made up of three members, successful microentrepreneurs with different businesses.

She has devoted her entire life to caring for her children whom she loves very much.  \"I am their father and their mother\", she says.  Dorotea's inspiration and hard work are reflected daily in her children's studies.  One of her children is studying at university whilst the other is still in high school.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, Dorotea gets up at the crack of dawn to go and work as a farm laborer, for which she receives a daily wage.  This allows her to meet her daily household expenses.  She makes the most of any free time she has to put her knitting skills to use.  She always carries her knitting needles and yarn in her bag with her so that she can knit hats, scarves and sweaters which she then sells to customers who she has gained through her hard work over the years.

They live together with their 2 children, for whom they want to provide a good future.  Even when he was an adolescent, Francisco was working on his parents' land, and he also used to work as a farmhand on various farms.  With the savings he accumulated, he bought his own land where he has been working independently for 26 years.  He cultivates cocoa and coffee.  His most profitable crop is cocoa, because he can sell it at a good price.  The months of June through August are when he plants all of his crops.  This is the reason why Francisco comes to this financial institution to apply for his loans, taking with him his goal of planting more cocoa plants.  \r\n\r\nWhat Francisco has in mind is to continue to cultivate and also acquire more land so that he can lift himself out of poverty.

His 2 oldest children sell bread from place to place on their bicycles.\r\n\r\nManuel travels by bus to the city to buy fertilizers for his corn crops, and to look for pigs to slaughter.   He will use the loan that he is requesting to buy fertilizers and pesticides for his corn crops, and also to buy pigs to sell.  With this investment in his crops he will get a greater yield, and so he expects to increase his earnings so that he can improve his family's quality of life.  He will also benefit from the part of the loan that will be invested in buying pigs.  With these earnings, he will be able to feed his family well and provide for their good health.  He plans to buy a vehicle to transport the pigs that he acquires from the various markets.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1203053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers and pesticides for his corn crops, and also to buy pigs to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T17:00:44Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T17:00:44Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":30.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":32.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":36.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":36.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":39.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":38.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":41.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":44.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":45.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":47.43},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":47.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":49.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":52.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.43},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":477955,"name":"Shahnaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms Shahnaz is 40 years old, a vigorous married woman.

He is single and lives by himself near a town; all his family members live in the country's mountains. He has his own house, from which he works day after day to create a better quality of life for himself. Gregorio's work consists of farming; he earns his living planting and harvesting two fundamental crops of the region where he lives. He grows oil palms, and that yield is sold to a very big oil-producing company. He also grows cacao, which he sells to various buyers who come from the capital looking for cacao, since the region produces the best of that fruit. Both crops are encouraged as alternatives to growing coca leaves. Gregorio has been working with cacao for six years and oil palm for four years. He does this alone, and when it is planting or harvesting season, he contracts workers who help him fill his orders on time. He considers his business profitable because of the demand and the good earnings he is left with.\r\n\r\nGregorio likes his work because he is in contact with nature and it is an environment in which he feels very comfortable. He loves what he does and it's going well since he is selling his yield at a good price.

This school was founded in 1973. Teachers of the school have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan. They are requesting a loan of 13,700,000 Sierra Leonean Leones for the entire group. With the help of this loan, these teachers will be in a better position to buy or invest in something that their mere salaries cannot let them do.\r\n \r\nMassah is the leader of the group.

She is married to Levfelic, a driver, and has one child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a variety store business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJennifer's business is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She gets supplies at wholesale prices and sells by the piece for a profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Jennifer is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJennifer hopes to give her child a quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and it's where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

He is 38 years old and lives with his wife, Minerva, and three children. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Maximiliano produces conventional coffee and is interested in changing to organic coffee. He is ready to receive technical assistance and follow the instructions from the technicians at the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d (Huatusco Regional Union) in order to make that change. For Jos\u00e9 Maximiliano it is very important to increase and improve his coffee production because it is his main labor activity. Most of his land was inherited from a parent and the rest was bought from his coffee sales. \r\n\r\nHis medium and long term goals are to replace his old plants with new ones and thus increase production. Consequently he is requesting a loan in order to purchase plants to re-sow and for technical work where they help him to stake his land and plant his crop. By increasing production and improving the quality of his coffee he will be able to increase his quality of life. Consequently he will be able to fulfill his greatest dream, which is that his children become professionals, but without ever forgetting work in the fields because the plots of land that he owns today will be their inheritance in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1206148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

of San Miguel, Bohol, has had a rice farming business for 30 years now.

He works in agriculture and in his free time he works around the area as a day laborer with his team of oxen, in order to earn a few centavos and be able to subsist. He suffered climatic problems with his last harvest, as drought and freezing caused the irrigation waters to fall, therefore affecting his production. This disaster meant an economic failure for his family, who relied on the agricultural production. Every year, they principally produce onions, carrots, and corn. Since the corn serves as fodder, it is essential for feeding Pastor's cattle.\r\n\r\nPastor is a very beloved and respected person in the place where he lives. He is requesting this loan to expand his dwelling, in order to improve his family's quality of life. He works on small parcels of land that he and his wife have.

Anarkhan is busy taking care of their new child now, so, her husband is now helping her with the store and the care of their other children. \r\n\r\nThe monthly income from Anarkhan's business is around 10,000 som. With the goal of long-term business development, Anarkhan has requested a 110,000 som loan from \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\". She wants this loan to diversify her product selection. Specifically, she would like to purchase tea, sugar, flour, and consumer goods for the home. Anarkhan plans to use the return from this loan to invest in her business, which will ultimately help her save for her son's university education.

He currently lives about 6 kilometers south of the city of Cochabamba. He rents the home with his wife, with whom he has two children. He plans to use the loan to purchase materials to make the charangos, since he currently does not have sufficient supplies to make and sell them. He has very few products ready for sale, and with the purchase of more materials he will be able to generate more income and one way or another be able to meet the needs of his family.

After many years of working with his brother, he left to go work on his own to try to make things better, and in this way he could earn more income to pay for his education. Thanks to his store currently having strong sales, his family has been able to overcome big financial hurdles, and his parents' health problems have also been improving. Even so, at the moment he is still facing a big problem and does not have enough money to stock his store.
