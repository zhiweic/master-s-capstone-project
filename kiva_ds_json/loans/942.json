She opened a small sewing workshop in her home and makes all kinds of clothing, but only in the evenings and at weekends as during the rest of the week she works as a seamstress in a workshop in the centre of town and receives a weekly wage. Nancy works every day from 6 am to 6 pm in the workshop and then at home  until 9 or 10 o\u2019 clock at night, sometimes even later when she has orders to complete.  She\u2019s been doing this for eight years so she can have money of her own which comes in handy to help with her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used partly to pay for a sewing machine that Nancy bought some time ago, and partly for fabric and other sewing supplies. She is in her third loan cycle with her Community Bank and likes the system because the loans are made quickly and without too much red tape.

Since that time, she has dedicated all of her efforts to providing for her family. She has always been a very cheerful person, hardworking and enthusiastic. She worked from the time she was very young to help her parents. Because of this, she wasn\u2019t able to study a professional career, but she would have liked to do so. In her free time, she likes to see movies and on special occasions she cooks a delicious \u201cpollo saltado\u201d [a Peruvian dish similar to stir-fried chicken] to share with her children.\r\n\r\nWith much effort and enthusiasm, Mercedes started a small business selling rolls. She makes bread by hand. Every day she starts her work in the very early hours of the morning. She works approximately 10 hours per day and she believes that business is going well because her clients recommend her because of her delicious breads and her friendly manner.\r\n\r\nMercedes is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because, due to the support they have provided, she will be able to buy ingredients such as: flour, baking powder, butter, eggs, baking sheets and molds, and other items, and in large quantities. Mercedes will have the necessary ingredients for her bakery, and with this, she hopes to increase her sales and her income, which will serve eventually to help her expand her business. This way she will continue working hard so that she and her family can get ahead.

A courageous woman entrepreneur, she is 38 years old and the mother of six children, who are all in school. Kafeka is a retailer of sundries in front of her home that include rice sugar, Fanta, soaps, salt, spices, etc. Her husband works at a transportation agency.\r\n\r\nKafeka started her business with a Hekima loan when she was informed by her friends of this microcredit program. The profits from her business go toward savings, food, and schooling for her children. However, she just completed seven loan cycles. Over that time, this client saw her business shrink following the crisis and the security problems in the region. Thanks to Hekima loans, she got important home supplies and equipment for her family.\r\n\r\nSo her new loan must serve to supply her with 2 sacks of garlic, 2 containers of Rina oil, and a variety of other goods. In addition, she would like to see her children grow up smoothly. \r\n\r\nThis client thanks Hekima and its partners for their actions in supporting poor women with low incomes to become

Her husband is a welding technician.\r\n\r\nBembeleza started her business with a Hekima loan when she was informed by her friends of this microcredit program. The profits from her business go toward savings, food, and schooling for her children. However, she just completed her fifth loan cycle. Over that time, this client saw her business progress upward, despite the multitude of taxes to which she is subjected. In any case, thanks to Hekima loans, she achieved important home supplies and equipment for her family.\r\n\r\nSo her new loan must serve to supply her with 30 wigs and a variety of other goods. In addition, she would like to see her children grow up smoothly. \r\n\r\nThis client thanks Hekima and its partners for their actions in supporting poor women with low incomes to become autonomous.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1089646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She lives in her mother\u2019s house, where she occupies just one room, and the house is located in the Alto San Pedro area of the city of La Paz.\r\n\r\nVanesa currently works in a sweet stall in a school. She works for more than five hours each day in the evenings, and in the mornings studies graphic design in a school. She therefore has to cover her education and food expenses, as well as paying for basic services for her family.\r\n\r\nVanesa\u2019s dream is to improve her income and become independent, which will give her son a more comfortable life and improve her own quality of life. This is the second time that she has requested a loan from IMPRO, and the first time with Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":720.69,"image":{"id":1180710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She works as a cook in a local school and, as a supplementary source of income for her family, cultivates crops and raises livestock, having started her business 13 years ago with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Kulnasiyna's hard work, her herd presently includes 2 cows with offspring, 15 goats and sheep, as well as 2 horses, while the monthly income from her business amounts to roughly 6,000 som (KGS). Kulnasiyna's business profits have allowed her to pay for her children's education.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Kulnasiyna has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to purchase 2 cows and 8 sheep or goats for fattening and resale. She plans to reinvest her profits from this loan into her business by purchasing a plot of

Eight years ago, Ce\u00edna made a living preparing lunches that she sold, but she got sick and it was medically necessary for her to stop doing it. For that reason, years after regaining her health, she started a service that allowed her to continue generating income and at the same time attend to her children. \r\n\r\nThis was how she ended up investing a small amount of capital in sweet tropical fruits, to be sold from her own home, little by little adding corn chicha beverages, snacks, tropical frozen sodas and cookies made by herself and her mother, which she prepares from a base of unrefined whole cane sugar.\r\n\r\nShe makes her sales in cash and her market is her neighbors.

They have three children, two of whom are already married and one who still lives with them. \r\n\r\nEugenio is personally in charge of his coffee plantations together with his son. Between the two of them, they carry out the tasks of cleaning, sowing and primarily cutting crops while his wife is in charge of the home duties. During the last harvest, Eugenio produced a total of 20 tons of organic coffee, and for the next harvest he is requesting a loan because he needs to prepare his land, clean it, and he wants to re-sow plants since some of them have already completed their life cycles and it is necessary to change them out. In this way he will be able to raise his production in three years. \r\n\r\nEugenio told us that since his two older children are already married, his greatest desire is to be able to offer his youngest son the opportunity to study at a university so that he will have better employment opportunities in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1182704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy coffee plants and prepare his land for sowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-09-10T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-10T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":24000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1775.04,"local_amount":23343.03,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":23442.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936723,"comment":null},{"amount":49.96,"local_amount":656.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":659.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810664,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T18:15:55Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467464,"name":"Duo Xejul Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao Xejul Este grupo est\u00e1 integrado por la se\u00f1ora  Ester, ella es originaria de San Juan Comalapa tiene hijos peque\u00f1os en edad escolar ella se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de g\u00fcipiles t\u00edpicos desde hace varios a\u00f1os y est\u00e1 solicitando este cr\u00e9dito para la compra de materia prima para la confecci\u00f3n de tejidos t\u00edpicos ya que sus clientes han aumentado y necesita capital para seguir trabajando.
