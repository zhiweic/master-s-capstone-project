He is an irresponsible person and does not care about his children. She has to prove herself a responsible and brave mother. During the six years she has attained a regular list of customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income.\r\n\r\nTo cope with the increasing demand of her customers, Samina requested a loan of 30,000 PKR from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, to purchase thread, fancy cloth, sequins, and pearls of various colors. She is representing herself as the group leader and is taking the responsibility for her group members.\r\n\r\nShe does not want to lose heart and wants to afford all household expenses with courage. She hopes that this loan will prove beneficial for her and for her family. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nNote: Samina is raising her hand in the given picture.

Presently, he needs additional capital to purchase a variety of embroidery material for the shop, including thread, embroidered lace, needles and colourful buttons. \r\n\r\nFor that his wife Shakeela has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband. She dreams of higher education for her children. And she is very much thankful to Kiva for such great help and kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":70.9,"image":{"id":1404321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase thread, embroidered lace, needles and colourful buttons.

is 44 years old, widowed and living in the village of Zeghduleti with her retired mother and two children (20 and 8 years old). Tinatin owns an apple garden and sells the fruit seasonally. Besides that, she produces hay for selling. Her young child gets monthly orphanage assistance from the local government (approximately $33 USD).\r\n\r\nAs their existing income is very small and is not enough to cover everyday expenses, Tinatin decided to re-start a clothing sales business, which was stopped due to financial problems. She requested a loan from the local credit providers, but they usually demand some stable income from the borrowers. Tinatin\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she didn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received this credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so-called Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With this loan of 2000 GEL (Georgia Lari) she will purchase clothing and household items at wholesale prices in Turkey and resell them in her community door-to-door.

For the past many days, his rickshaw has not worked properly because of which, he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Rasoolan has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

She is the mother of 5 children: 2 daughters and 3 sons. Her whole family is fully dependent on her husband.  \r\n\r\nHer husband has only a single source of income. Her husband owns a paint workshop in which he provides the services to paint the bodies of auto rickshaws. He paints old and damaged bodies using paint spray guns.  The paint gun works through the air pressure. He has been providing these services for many years and has a good reputation in the market.  A few days ago, his spray gun broke and he is low on his stock of paint. He does not have money to buy spray guns and paint because he already spent his savings on the maintenance of his workshop.  Therefore, Rukhsana requested a loan for her husband so that her husband would be able to buy a new spray gun and paint to carry on his business.\r\n\r\nRukhsana says thank you to all of our field

He works  in agriculture, growing a variety of vegetables including potatoes, manioc and maize on his plot of land located in the town of La Primavera. This is Carlos' first loan with the organisation, and he is going to use it to buy seeds to grow maize,  after first preparing the ground. His reason for requesting the loan is to obtain the resources he needs to grow his crops and make a living. Carlos faces challenges in his business such as bad weather, which often ruins his crops.

She has 26 years experience looking after and grazing cattle to fatten them up.  Ana is married and has three children, who also help to look after the animals.  One of her daughters is in eighth grade.  Ana learned her trade alongside her husband as they have no education and their chances of employment were almost nil.  Ana takes her animals to graze all day and, in the rainy season, grows corn so that she has fodder to feed the cattle in the dry season.  In addition Ana cuts up pigs once a week to sell from door to door in the community - she keeps going until there is no meat left.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy her animals, Ana has to board a lorry to get to the market.  The journey lasts almost an hour and, once there, she has to choose the animals she likes and negotiate the price.  This can take all day.  At the end of the day, she loads the animals into the lorry and makes the journey back home.\r\n\r\nAna is applying to \"Fundaci\u00f3n Campo\" for a loan to buy four heifers to graze and fatten up - each heifer costs $350.  With more heifers, Ana will increase her small herd, helping her sales to be more constant.  With a larger number of animals and continuous sales, Ana will have a more constant income and this will improve her quality of life and she will be able to pay for her daughter's education.\r\n\r\nAna plans to save money so her daughter can study and become a professional - she can then have a better life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":180.89,"image":{"id":1407417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy four heifers to graze and fatten up - each heifer costs $350.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-11T13:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-10T13:50:06Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":39.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":56.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":62.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":66.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":69.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":74.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":77.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":92.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.98},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.62,"local_amount":39.62,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":39.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090857,"comment":null},{"amount":48.63,"local_amount":48.63,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":48.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856854,"comment":null},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":47.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":47.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505124,"comment":null},{"amount":45.06,"local_amount":45.06,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":45.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716204,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T01:21:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591974,"name":"Vandy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vandy is 30 years old.

Her two children study in the sixth grade and her partner works as a labourer in sugar cane plantations earning $4.00 a day.  \r\n\r\nHer business is in her home and she starts work at 7:00 in the morning, cooking corn. She then takes it to be ground up and and 9:00 she starts making the tortillas, finishing at 13:00 in the afternoon. She then begins the whole process again at 15:00 and finishes at 18:30. She works alone and invests her earnings in buying household goods and her children's education. She buys the corn to make her tortillas from a nearby shop, and she buys firewood from people who go around the town selling it from their pick-up. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 5 bags of corn for $40.00 each. Buying this a large amount at once means she can get it for a lower price, and avoid wasting time having to buy more corn every time. Being able to store the corn in her home also means that she can always be sure of having enough for her customers, since when there is a shortage of corn in the shops this creates delays in her business.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to save up so that her children can study to become professionals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1407412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy 5 bags of corn, worth $40.00 each.\r\n.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-11T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-10T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatr\u00edz Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":17.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":17.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":18.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":19.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":19.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":21.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":22.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":23.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.07,"local_amount":19.07,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":19.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090856,"comment":null},{"amount":180.93,"local_amount":180.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":180.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856853,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-11T15:17:28Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":593999,"name":"Barrio Municipal Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cBARRIO MUNICIPAL\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el cuarto ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Collpani, est\u00e1 compuesta por nueve integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Micaela es la Presidenta.

He has spent a large part of his work life as an agricultural day laborer.  He was contracted by hour or by harvest, which caused his finances to be fairly unstable.  Because of this he decided to look for other options so he could generate a more stable income.\r\n\r\nFive months ago he started selling pastry, candy, cigarettes, and cookies as a street vendor and in a small stall he acquired.  This way he has earned income to support himself and his mother on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nPedro's a hardworking and enterprising man who very much wants to move forward.  He's motivated to request a loan to invest in buying stock (pastry, cookies, candy, chocolate, cigarettes, water, and soda) and a portable polystyrene cooler to chill beverages.  This will allow him to offer his customers a wider variety of products to satisfy their tastes and needs.  His sales will increase and he'll have a more stable income.\r\n\r\nPedro dreams of getting recognition for his business, being very well known in the area, increasing his clientele, and having the opportunity to give his mother a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75.83,"image":{"id":1407774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock and a cooler","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Copacabana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-11T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-10T18:40:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Nel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25025},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25712},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":26417},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":27141},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":27885},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":28650},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":29435},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30242},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":31072},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":31924},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":32799},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":33698}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":14.67,"local_amount":25666,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T09:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":27456.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822363,"comment":null},{"amount":15.21,"local_amount":26609,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":28465.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807350,"comment":null},{"amount":14.49,"local_amount":25349,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":27117.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095442,"comment":null},{"amount":15.64,"local_amount":27376,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":29286.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074503,"comment":null},{"amount":15.82,"local_amount":27680,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":29611.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009696,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T02:51:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592044,"name":"Herbert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Herbert, a 34-year-old married father of three living in Fort Portal Uganda, operates a wholesale shop but also grows crops to earn a living.

Cristina began her business of selling pork one year ago. The business is doing quite well, but she would like to expand. She joined the Celestial Trust Bank in order to secure a loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to purchase four pigs to meet current demand. As the construction business is quite slow in the current economic climate in Guatemala, Christina holds the vision that her business will grow and she will become the main breadwinner of the family.\r\n\r\nThe Celestrial Trust Bank expresses gratitude to all Kiva investors. They are so pleased to be able to secure these loans, expand their businesses, and provide additional income for their families. They value the supportive relationships that they have with their fellow Trust Bank members. They all look forward to a brighter future, one in which they have the necessary tools for success!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1711.11,"image":{"id":1403757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase pigs for her pork selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Cantel Quetzaltenango","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-08-11T22:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-10T22:00:01Z","loan_amount":4100,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisa Santiaga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aura Hermelinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Fabiola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Floridalma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid Abigail ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Maria \t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2671},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2619}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":335.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":684.44,"local_amount":5342,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5365.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089121,"comment":null},{"amount":342.23,"local_amount":2671,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2682.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855090,"comment":null},{"amount":342.22,"local_amount":2671,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2682.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503426,"comment":null},{"amount":342.22,"local_amount":2671,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2682.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728410,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T13:59:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592210,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nancy is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a t-shirt printing business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 15000 through NWTF to buy materials for her t-shirt printing business.\r\n\r\nNancy has been in this business for 22 years.

She has been practicing animal husbandry since 2005. The business began with 6,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her incredibly hard and productive work Gulmira has achieved some successes in development of her business. She now earns a monthly profit of 6,000 som (KGS), and today owns three dairy cows, 15 sheep, and a horse. Her husband and children help with the business. Her husband also works as a shepherd. In order to further develop her business, Gulmira came to the microfinance group Bai Tushum and Partners for a 20,000 som (KGS) loan to buy sheep.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, Lila, is located in a neighborhood of the second largest city in Guatemala called Quetzaltenango, in the western highlands. The Trust Bank is composed of eight women who average 43 years of age. Each has an average of four children. These women work in various businesses like animal husbandry, production and sales of tiles, manufacture and sale of shoes, as well as textile sales.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Cecilia, better known as Do\u00f1a Ceci, who is a cheerful, enthusiastic and collaborative lady who is the secretary for the Lila Trust Bank. She enjoys this job very much. She has taken out several loans with Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\n Do\u00f1a Ceci is a 46-year-old married woman with ten children who range in age from 5 to 27. Five of the children are in school. Do\u00f1a Ceci is committed to seeing each of them complete their education and start their careers. With this goal in mind, she created a business from her first loan with Friendship Bridge and began raising animals such as chickens and ducks. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Do\u00f1a Ceci wants to add more animals to her business, so she is requesting a loan to purchase six turkeys, several chickens and two pigs. In addition, she has budgeted some funds from her loan to buy food for the animals in order to fatten them for market. Do\u00f1a Ceci\u2019s dream is to enlarge her business and have as many animals as possible. She is aware that some take a longer time to fatten and sell. In the future, she hopes to sell eggs as well.\r\n\r\nThe earnings that Do\u00f1a Ceci has generated have allowed her to move forward, and she feels empowered! In her own words: \u201cMy group and I appreciate the financial support through Friendship Bridge. It is incredible to know that people from around the world (Kiva investors) are helping us through the Internet.\u201d She giggles about the Internet and adds, \u201cI'm not sure how that works.\u201d She adds, \u201cGod bless them and all their generosity because it really is so important to us to have this opportunity.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1661.07,"image":{"id":1403763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase turkeys, pigs and chickens.

He has been selling fruits and vegetables for 13 years. Vladimir buys produce on the wholesale market and then transports it to small stores. In addition, he sells from his home, and also at the market in a residential neighborhood. He rents a storage facility in that part of the city.  \r\nVladimir's primary sales are of potatoes and cabbage, especially just before the onset of winter.

Right now the family's only source of income is what the oldest son sends home from his work abroad. Those funds don't cover the family's expenses though. Yusupjon decided to start an income generating family business, and he chose animal husbandry. He intends to buy and sell cattle. His wife and children will help. Yusupjon knows how to raise livestock because they already have a family milk cow. Yusupjon's starting capital will be 125 USD, and they also have a 10x4 meter shed in the yard and 100 bundles of hay. With the goal of beginning the business, Yusupjon is asking for a loan to buy 4 bull calves and their feed. He wants to use the income earned to pay for his son's wedding.

","en":"Jose, 41 years old, is married and has three children. He works in the commercial sector, and he has had his own businesses such as a vegetable shop and a distillery. However, due to various external factors, he had to close them. Currently, he works as a public service taxi driver. He has to pay a percentage of the money he earns to the owner of the vehicle, which causes economic instability in his home. But Jose, with his enterprising attitude, drive, determination, and effort, took the initiative to sell Amway products to complement his income.

After getting married at the age of 21, she decided to start her own business, in order to generate income and contribute to the household expenses. So she learned the art of dressmaking and with that knowledge opened her own shop in her home. Initially she sewed for third parties, but three years later started with her own line of articles for the home like sheets, bed clothing, quilts, towels, pillow-cases, etc. Doing this she was able to pay the household expenses and get her children ahead. Working independently she could be flexible and choose her own hours. \r\n\r\nCelina is an enterprising and active woman, dedicated to her family and to her work. For these reasons she is requesting this loan in order to buy supplies at wholesale prices (fabric, thread, needles and synthetic cotton) and pay off an existing loan.

She is currently separated.  Due to a lack of work opportunities and the financial difficulties she went through after her partner left her, Martha decided to start her own business to get the resources she needed on her own.  All of the financial responsibility fell to her, as the head of her household.  She opened a sales stall selling food, sodas and pastries in the neighborhood she lives in.  Since she started the business, it has been going well as there are a lot of people who pass through the area.  Martha has the help of one direct employee, which allows her to stay on top of her daughter's education.  Martha is an enterprising, sensible and active woman, and she is constantly looking for ways to get ahead.  That is why she is requesting a second loan cycle.  She plans to invest it in the purchase of fixed assets (a refrigerator\/freezer) and wholesale stock (pastries, cookies, candies, ice cream, sodas, beer) to offer a greater variety of products and a better service to her customers to satisfy their wants and needs.  Then she will be able to increase her clientele and consequently her income.  And she will be able to keep moving toward making her dream come true- to open a large and comfortable restaurant for her customers.  That would allow Martha to have a favorable financial stability and to give her daughter a better education and a better quality of life.

This way he can increase his profit margin, continue supporting his household finances, and continue investing in his business.

He is the father of 3 children and is in a common-law marriage with his spouse. \r\n\r\nHis working life is spent as a construction worker, but seeing as that is a very unstable and uncertain field, he decided to start his own business, a fast food stall. This is an activity that he alternates with his work in construction.\r\n\r\n He initially started out selling products like hot dogs, hamburgers, and French fries, among others, from a street corner. As every day he had more customers, he decided to rent a small shop where his customers would be more comfortable. In this way, he has been able to obtain enough resources to get his family ahead.  \r\n\r\nGildardo is an enterprising, vigorous, and very hardworking man. His business opens from Wednesday to Sunday at 5 p.m., as this is when he finishes his daily work at his job. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting support from the loan in order to invest in the purchase of supplies (bread, potatoes, cold meat, soft drinks, sauces) and make improvements to his business, as it\u2019s somewhat deteriorated. This will help him to improve his business\u2019s image in order to attract more customers, and to have basic supplies available to fill demand and satisfy his guests\u2019 wishes. \r\n\r\nGildardo hopes to be able to save some money and purchase his building in order to improve his creditworthiness and offer better general welfare, education, and quality of life to his children and his spouse.

She has been a seamstress for twenty years, first in the employ of several clothing companies, and now for a few workshops in her area, where she does embroidery and puts the finishing touches on clothes. Mar\u00eda was fortunate enough to save money and to buy houses, from which she now derives a monthly income, which she needs to pay for household expenses. She is very determined, organised, and full of enterprising spirit. She is also very devoted to both her family and her work, and proudly states that her age does not get in the way of her doing what she likes. Mar\u00eda asks for a loan in order to buy a sewing machine and supplies, so as to keep working and get more orders to fulfill. This will enable her to make her dream of buying more sophisticated sewing machines come true. This way, she would be able to fulfill orders for more workshops. She also wants to learn how to use these machines so as to then give single mothers an employment opportunity and improve her standard of living as well as theirs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":219.01,"image":{"id":1407966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy fixed assets (a sewing machine) and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-12T08:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-11T08:50:01Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":71501},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":73462},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75476},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":77546},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":79672},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":81856},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":84101},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":86407},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":88776},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91211},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93712},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":96280}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.52},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.33,"local_amount":71530,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T09:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":73651.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822367,"comment":null},{"amount":40.34,"local_amount":73350,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":75525.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807360,"comment":null},{"amount":46.28,"local_amount":84150,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":86645.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095452,"comment":null},{"amount":45.01,"local_amount":81833,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84259.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074512,"comment":null},{"amount":48.05,"local_amount":87362,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":89952.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009706,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T19:18:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591568,"name":"Ephata Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Mwambikwa est leader du collectif  d\u2019affaire  \u00ab Ephata\u00bb, jeune entrepreneur exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 36 ans et m\u00e8re de 5 enfants qui \u00e9tudient tous.

She is requesting a loan to pay for her studies. This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Blasina; I was born and raised in the municipality of Hato Viejo, Yamasa, Monte Plata, located in Northeastern Dominican Republic. I am 20 years old. I am a student with limited resources, and due to my family\u2019s economic condition, it is difficult for me to pay for my studies. My parents do not make enough and I am unemployed. I have a large family: eight siblings supported by my father, who is a public-transport driver and makes barely enough to feed a family of eleven.\r\n\r\nMy dream is to become a professional. My community lacks people that are willing to help Hato Viejo to progress. I would like to give a small contribution to these people who have many needs, such as my family. I am currently working as a volunteer in a literacy program in my community, called \u201cQuisqueya aprende contigo\u201d [Quisqueya learns with you], which fills my heart with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI am studying dentistry in UPHEC, a university with well-prepared teachers. However, I need RD$251,000 [DOP] in order to pay for the tuition fee and I do not have them.\r\n\r\nThis loan is important for me, in order to make my dream come true and contribute to my community. Without it, it would be impossible for me to continue with my studies, which can open doors that would otherwise be closed for me and my family. They need my support and I hope to have one or several helping hands that believe in me and in my dream of becoming a dentist. When I become a professional, I will be able to support others as well."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1404683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Up until now, he has been managing to get by without them but it has become a challenge. With books and school supplies, he feels he will be able to get better grades. One of his biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. Unfortunately, Nelson's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, his parents never had the chance to move up. Growing up, finances have always been tight. Nelson currently works 25 hours a week as a security guard to help afford his school and living expenses.\r\n\r\nThis loan is administered by Vittana's partner

She is optimistic about her loan, because in the summer more people consume meat due to the holidays and increased customers in restaurants.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":849.98,"image":{"id":1404878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 12 sheep to sell more meat in the summer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Bilasuvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.5 48.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2013-08-12T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-11T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Safura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":133.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399738488,"comment":null},{"amount":169.99,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":133.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410009058,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":133.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419772304,"comment":null},{"amount":169.99,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":133.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430004725,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":133.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439640973,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T02:30:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592327,"name":"Liberty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Liberty.

He wants to purchase a water tank and water pipes for irrigation purposes, and he has applied for a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, of KES 40,000, to undertake the project. This loan will boost his production, because there will be continuous irrigation, thus making his crops do well. Profit from the increased production will help improve his family's living standard.

is a 33-year-old married man who lives with his wife, 9-year-old daughter, and parents.  The entire family is actively involved in agricultural activities.  In particular, they have 4 milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese products.  They also have a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown.  David works hard to ensure a good harvest.  \n\nHe decided to start his own business because his current income is seasonal and not enough for the family.  All of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, David applied for the credit to MFO Credo.  His request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative, start-up program with Kiva.

He has been growing young tomatoes and peppers on his 20 decares of land since 1998.  His family includes his wife and two children, of whom the youngest is 6 and the eldest 15. They all help manage the farm.    \r\n\r\nAndrey started the business by growing tomatoes in an open field.  It's expensive to hire labor, so he has decided to get a walk-behind tractor to till and cultivate his plot. In the future (not right now), he and his wife plan to get a seed sowing machine for the tractor, plus they plan to plant cucumbers and squash.  \r\n\r\nAndrey's plans for his family include providing his children with a good education and buying a car to take his produce to the market to sell.

In particular, he has a plot of agricultural land where nut trees and mandarin trees are grown.  He sells the harvested products at the local markets. \n\nAs the existing income is seasonal and not enough for a four-member family, Edvard decided to start his own business.  All of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Edvard applied for the credit to MFO Credo.  His request was approved in the framework of a Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva.  This program enables the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  \n\nA loan of $3,000 will help him to purchase a minibus.  Once the minibus is purchased, he will work on the minibus line and increase the family income.  With the increased income, he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family members.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":520.57,"image":{"id":1402101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase a minibus and work on the minibus line.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Jikhanjuri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-12T15:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-11T15:00:13Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edvard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":99.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":101.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":105.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":105.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":108.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":111.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":117.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":115.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":119.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":120.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":123.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":126.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":130.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":131.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":134.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":136.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":139.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":143.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":144.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":147.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":152.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":201.18,"local_amount":201.18,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":201.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134295,"comment":null},{"amount":105.1,"local_amount":105.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":105.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107876,"comment":null},{"amount":105.38,"local_amount":105.38,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":105.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255410,"comment":null},{"amount":108.91,"local_amount":108.91,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":108.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019540,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T22:36:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592320,"name":"Rojita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rojita is 28 years old and married.
