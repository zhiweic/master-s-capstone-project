Thanks to her persistent hard work, her farm now includes 4 dairy cows and brings in monthly earnings of 10,000 Som from the sale of milk and dairy products. For the purpose of developing her business, Kalyiman has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 Som to buy 2 cows.

She has two adult children who are completing higher education outside the city.  Somewhat exhausted by the agricultural work located quite far from her community, she decided to contribute to her family\u2019s economic growth by opening a grocery store two years ago.\r\n\r\nThanks to her business she\u2019s managed to cover the expenses generated by her children\u2019s higher education which makes her feel very motivated by the accomplishments she\u2019s been attaining.  It\u2019s worth mentioning that having her business located on the corner of the square is very beneficial because customer flow is almost constant.  In order to continue with good end-of-year sales she needs to restock the store with panettones and food items in high demand hoping to earn good profits like other local businesses.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to build a brick and cement house that she hopes will be for her children who once they complete their higher education will return home to contribute to their community.  This will be her loan #14 and she feels happy because since she started with MFP she\u2019s been able to maintain good economic stability in her activities.  She comments that she likes working as a team in her communal bank because she\u2019s a very sociable person.  She will use the 500 new soles to add to her capital earmarked to buy panettones and others for the end-of-year sales campaign. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1250305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy panettones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-06T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-05T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saragoza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":54.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":58.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":62.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":67.27},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.88,"local_amount":54.7,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":56.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189018,"comment":null},{"amount":23.32,"local_amount":58.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":60.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572921,"comment":null},{"amount":22.79,"local_amount":56.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":58.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122571,"comment":null},{"amount":24.83,"local_amount":62.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":64.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868398,"comment":null},{"amount":25.66,"local_amount":64.13,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":66.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577226,"comment":null},{"amount":26.49,"local_amount":66.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":68.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529466,"comment":null},{"amount":26.91,"local_amount":67.27,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":69.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974558,"comment":null},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":70.3,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":72.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995978,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-09T03:26:10Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504678,"name":"Foska","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

They have no children yet. They both work in order to achieve their aim, which is to have a stable home.\r\n\r\nDiligent and hardworking, eight years ago Elizabet decided to set up a stall selling vegetables and groceries at her local market. Her mother was very supportive of this. She says that she was very lucky when she set up her stall, because it was the last one available at the market and also she was asked to join as the last member of the communal bank. \r\n\r\nShe really enjoys her work as it is a good way to generate income for her family and to establish herself as a business owner. The factors that motivate her in the business are the solid friendships that she has made over the years, and who have gone on to become loyal customers. However, at times customers ask to purchase goods on credit. This results in a considerable delay in payment which can be problematic.\r\n\r\nThe winter season has started when businesses generally increase their sales. Shops start to purchase panettones (a type of cake eaten at Christmas time) and other seasonal supplies in order to earn good profits. \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue working with the same enthusiasm that she has been noted for up to now, so that in the future she can become the owner of a wholesale grocery business. This is her eighth loan with MFP. She believes in the idea that progress is based on honouring her commitments and responsibility. As a result she has a good credit history. She is very pleased with how the members of the communal bank have achieved good economic growth during the time that they have been receiving support via micro-loans.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1,000 Nuevos Soles she will purchase panettones and other seasonal supplies in order to make the most of the Christmas season, as the other businesses in the area are doing.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1250341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy panettones and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-06T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-05T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":110.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":113.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":119.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":122.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":124.97},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":132.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":135.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":140.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":110.46,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":114.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189021,"comment":null},{"amount":45.32,"local_amount":113.29,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":117.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572924,"comment":null},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":119.29,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":123.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122574,"comment":null},{"amount":49.02,"local_amount":122.57,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":126.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868401,"comment":null},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":124.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":129.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577229,"comment":null},{"amount":53.11,"local_amount":132.78,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:42Z","rounded_local_amount":137.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529469,"comment":null},{"amount":54.4,"local_amount":135.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":140.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974561,"comment":null},{"amount":56.26,"local_amount":140.65,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":145.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995981,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-21T19:04:29Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504711,"name":"Mujeres Unidas Por El Progreso Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Buenos Tardes!!!

He has always tried to provide his children with the necessities of life and a good education, which he considers to be the number one priority. He works very hard in an organization where he is one of the best employees. His wife is a homemaker, so Buzurgmehr is the sole breadwinner of the family. He wants to repair his home because it is not up to housing standards. He must repair all rooms as they are not fit for Tajikistan winters, which can be quite cold. Due to the lack of comfortable conditions, his children always have colds in the wintertime. Buzurgmehr is seeking a loan of 3,500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy building materials to repair his house. He and his children are waiting for kind lenders to help them resolve their housing problems.

She says that previously she wanted to get into pineapple production but she decided to postpone it because the land still had cacao trees in their productive phase and it's feasible to get the maximum profit from them.  To supplement her earnings she harvests some fruits, such as oranges and bananas, and sells them to vendors in the street fair in her town to earn additional profit for her weekly purchases.  She wants to have enough capital to start the cacao-planting season smoothly, so she needs to weed, hire day laborers, and apply organic fertilizer.\r\n\r\nShe's a mother who offers to help with the various commercial activities, so she planned to get started raising pigs using some technology because she thinks the price they get currently is very profitable compared to other barnyard animals.

They have a wonderful, newborn son together. Jumakan's husband helps her with managing her business, mostly with selling the products. In search of a source of income for her family, Jumakan started working with poultry farming three years ago, after having invested 10,000 som (KGS) in this business. Thanks to persistent work, Jumakan currently has a well-developed poultry business, which brings in around 30,000 som (KGS) per month through sales of eggs and chickens.\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Jumakan needs to get new chickens. Because her chickens are old, she only gets around 40 trays of eggs per day, instead of potentially 70-80. Jumakan turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of 200 chickens. By increasing the number of eggs, Jumakan can increase her income. Jumakan plans to invest the income from the loan in developing her business. She plans to open her own sales point for selling eggs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1193.63,"image":{"id":1249773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Rebecca's biggest business challenge is the high price of slippers, coats, and other merchandise. \r\n\r\nRebecca is requesting a 30,000 KES loan to buy coats, slippers, and scarves to sell. This will be her third loan with SMEP DTM and she has successfully repaid her previous loans. Rebecca's business goal is to run a boutique within five years. She hopes that, in the future, she will use her profits to improve her family's living standards\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1250161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

Eyad wants to buy some necessary home appliances such as a refrigerator and a heater to use in this cold winter.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose Eyad took a USD loan from FATEN, which will help the family to cover some of its necessary expenses and live in better home conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:  FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She proved herself to be very reliable with her previous loan, never once violating the terms of credit. Khursan fattens and sells cattle. She also processes milk, using part for her own consumption and selling part to her neighbours. Her husband is a pensioner and helps her on the farm, mainly by looking after the cattle and taking them to market to be sold. Two of her sons have gone to the Russian Federation to earn money. They also help their parents by sending money home. Khursan plans to use this loan to buy cattle to increase her herd. She is thankful to Arvand for the financial support.

They received a house made of wood from their parents with the goal of providing them the facilities to achieve homeownership. With the objective of replacing her work in the field, she opted to work selling vegetables in her local market 2 years ago. \r\n\r\nWith the support of her parents and her partner, she managed to initiate the sale of chicken and groceries. She considers her work to be very relaxed. It is necessary that she be in constant contact with the public, which has enabled her to make many friendships, who are ultimately loyal customers of her business. However, the rainy days are when she has the least sale of her products and some go to waste, given that providing quality is essential for her as a reliable vendor. \r\n\r\nNoticing a small growth in daily sales, she wants to have enough capital to always keep her business well stocked; that is why she wants to have sacks of cereal, canned foods and other goods. \r\n\r\nHer long-term goals are to be a wholesale grocery store owner. It is one of her dreams that she is sure with work and effort she can make a reality. This is her first loan, and she is already thankful for it was always a tool that she wanted to use. She hopes to take care of it with responsible repayments. With the 1000 soles, she will keep her business well stocked for a long period of time by purchasing bags of cereal, canned foods and wholesale chicken. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1250482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"purchase sacks of cereal, canned food and wholesale chicken.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T02:10:06Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"May ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":110.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":113.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":119.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":122.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":124.97},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":132.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":135.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":140.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":110.46,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":114.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189027,"comment":null},{"amount":45.32,"local_amount":113.29,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":117.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572930,"comment":null},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":119.29,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":123.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122580,"comment":null},{"amount":49.02,"local_amount":122.57,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":126.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868407,"comment":null},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":124.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":129.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577235,"comment":null},{"amount":53.11,"local_amount":132.78,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:43Z","rounded_local_amount":137.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529475,"comment":null},{"amount":54.4,"local_amount":135.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":140.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974567,"comment":null},{"amount":56.26,"local_amount":140.65,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995987,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-09T13:27:40Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504764,"name":"Santa Rosa De Lima De Conchacalla Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cSANTA ROSA DE LIMA DE CONCHACALLA\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Anta, perteneciente a la provincia de Anta y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

They all live in a small village on the outskirts of Bishnupur in Manipur State, which is in the northeastern part of India. They came together as a group to avail a loan in order to create income activities for themselves.\r\n\r\nBimota is the group leader pictured with a raised hand. She is 38 years old and is the mother of three daughters and one son. She lives with eight members as a family. Her husband's main lines of income are selling firewood and bamboo. However, this source of income is exhausted by itself and takes time to replenish. Therefore, in order to supplement the family income, she usually weaves traditional garments but could not produce much due to limited capital at her disposal. She initiated and formed the group to fulfill the capital needs for her weaving income activities.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2009, she bought all the requirements for weaving (loom, thread, needs). She started weaving four days a week and was able to produce six traditional wrap rounds of different quality and four shawls in a month and a week\u2019s time. Her husband helped her out with the loan repayments for the initial four months. With the profits, she was able to repay the loan and buy yarn to continue weaving. \r\n\r\nWith her second loan, she was able to produce more by employing one more weaver and channeling her sales by supplying a retailer as well as selling some herself. With her income, she managed to support her children's education better. She was able to pay the children's school fees on time. She is happy that her oldest son can continue his graduation class. She is very happy with all the support that she gets from her husband as well as her children. Her children did well by bringing home their friends to buy the traditional garments that their mother weaves. In this way, people know where to buy when they need one.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to continue with her weaving business. She will use the loan to stock yarn of different colors and textures to weave the traditional wrap round, shawls and vest coats that she has been weaving. She also means to use part of the loan for the children's enrollment fees for the next session.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members also need another loan to upgrade and do better at their respective activities. The group members' activities can be classified as spring onion farming, fishery, piggery and yam cultivation.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1250061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy yarns of varied colors and texture to weave traditional garments.

They live on an island in the lake, which is a tourist center in the department of La Paz, offering local crafts made from reeds and wool. The majority of the inhabitants make a living in fishing and tourism. This is her first loan with this institution, and Maribel plans to use it to purchase a bigger fishing boat and nets. She sells her fish in the city of La Paz, and with this new boat she wants to increase her production and satisfy her customers' demands. Maribel is a person with a desire to move up in life, and she feels happy and grateful for the institution for providing support because her business is her only source of income and she needs to

She was left her with six children, of which 5 go to school.\r\n<p>\r\nSarah is a vendor dealing in the sale of secondhand clothes in various markets, especially in Kamwokya. This is how she is able to earn a living for her family. She started this business in 2003 after her husband passed away. Sarah\u2019s clients are people who visit the markets and a few of her regular customers place orders for different clothes. Her dream is to have a permanent business place where her customers can find her on a regular basis and also to see her children having a bright future.\r\n<p>\r\nHer major obligations are paying school fees, feeding children and paying house rent for the family, among others.\r\n<p>\r\nHer major challenges are lack of enough capital to raise enough returns to meet her major obligations and the weather conditions, especially during rainy seasons since she works in an open place, which slows down the growth of her business.\r\n<p>\r\nSarah is very hardworking, social, and honest. She will use part of the loan to rent a small stall in order to get a permanent working place and the balance will be used to add stock in her business in order to earn enough income to support her family and provide for all basic needs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1250266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to rent a stall to do her trade.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rubaga Road","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hadijja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":616666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":616666.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":617833.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339635426,"comment":null},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":616668.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":617834.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347362410,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":616665.01,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":617831.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589627,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":616664.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":617831.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993588,"comment":null},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":616670,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":617836.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040307,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":616665,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":617831.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381830942,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-17T14:24:51Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:56:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504460,"name":"Loyola Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose, who is in her late 30s, is married and living with her husband with two children of whom one is in school.

She is applying for her sixth loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua in order to start a new business to increase and improve her income to make sure that she will have a stable financial situation especially that she is aging with no one to support her financially.  \r\n\r\nShe will start selling clothes and she hopes that the styles she is going to sell will attract customer's attention.  She is a good standing borrower with an excellent history of paying back her loans.  Her previous loans helped her a lot in increasing her business capital.

These Tribal women live in a small village at the outskirts of Bishnupur town in the state of Manipur located in the North Eastern part of India. Unemployment is a big problem in this part of the country. \r\n\r\nPouphanliu is the member pictured with raised hand. She is happily married and is a mother to two sons and two daughters. She teaches kindergarten in a private school nearby where her husband is the school principal. All her children go to the same school where she teaches. Her salary, put together with her husband's, is not handsome enough to sustain the family especially when the children come of age and require a bigger amount for their education. Keeping this in mind she has been weaving from time to time to save even before accessing a loan. She also cultivated a homestead garden where she grows vegetables for consumption purposes.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2009, she purchased weaving materials and employed two weavers to weave traditional garments such as mufflers, sling bags and wrap-around skirts. Samples of the traditional wrap-arounds, her finished products, can be seen in the photograph. She was able to repay her loan on time and increase her savings. She used the second loan for the same weaving activities and began employing the two weavers full-time. She supplied the finished garments to retailers from the main city, Imphal, for bigger profit and faster sale.\r\n\r\nNow Pouphanliu needs another loan to increase her production by expanding her weaving shed so that she can hire one more weaver. She will buy tin sheets for the roof and do away with the thatch roof.\r\n\r\nPouphanliu plans to open a vocational school starting with weaving and incorporating other activities down the road. She also plans to introduce the handloom method of weaving. She is very happy that through her income activities at least two women are getting employed apart from the retailer. She has also kept her options open to quit her teaching profession once her children are old enough to go to school by themselves and focus on her vocational activities.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too needed another loan to continue with their respective activities. Potato cultivation, ginger plantation, spring onion plantation, rearing cows, farming vegetables such as mustard leaves and cabbage, and yam cultivation are activities that the group members undertake for income earning.

By character, she is a very calm, friendly woman who believes in a bright future for her family and the country as a whole. \r\n\r\nAs a source of income for her family, Kaliyahan in 2010 started to engage in field crops and livestock, beginning this business with the sum of 10,000 KGS. Through hard work, Kaliyahan today has in her farm five dairy cows, and a monthly income from the farm of about 10,000 Som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Kaliyahan appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 Som (KGS) to buy two cows. Kaliyahan plans to use income from the loan to invest in business development by purchasing additional livestock, saving up for her son's wedding next year.

Mazira is a very kind and hard-working woman, but her fate has been a difficult one. When she got married, she and her husband did not have a house, so for several years they lived in a camp in a field. With the help of her parents, 15 years ago Mazira began her own animal husbandry business. She sells cattle that she has spent several months raising, and has many clients at the market. For 5 years, she saved up her earnings from this business to buy a house. Now she owns a cottage that she wants to renovate. She also wants to buy more cattle to develop her business. Mazira is now seeking a loan of 3,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy cattle and to purchase building materials to repair her house. With the income generated by this loan, she plans to provide her children with a good education and modern technology. She is waiting for your kindness. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1249934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Amretdin is 54 years old. He is married and is raising three children. He is a very hardworking and honest person. For more than 30 years, he has been working as a welder at a company. His colleagues very much respect and cherish his friendship, because he is a very loyal friend. \r\n\r\nHis wife is a homemaker and therefore he is the sole breadwinner for the family. His salary is not sufficient to provide the family with all the needed resources. Year after year, his children require more support. He must buy furniture for his home--to have a sofa and chair--as he will soon have guests. At this time he cannot receive visitors. He is asking for a loan of 3,000 Somoni to buy furniture. He promises to repay the loan on time. He is awaiting your kindness.

Even though I have my job as a teacher, the resources I generate at present are to support my family and help pay for my brother\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nKiva would be of great help and encouragement for me to reach my dream of studying for a Master\u2019s in the United Kingdom.

The only guarantee I have is putting all my effort into it and giving the best I have of myself.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1250289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay application fees for a Master's in Economic Development.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1900000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":1900000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1903231.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833624,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-07T19:25:25Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T13:41:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504695,"name":"Gf Wangnime Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe \"GF WANGNIME\" est compos\u00e9 de huit personnes qui sont des amis et appartiennent \u00e0 un m\u00eame groupe de tontine.

","en":"Chynara is 51 years old and is the mother of 2 children. She is a calm and industrious woman by nature. She has a high school education, and has been involved in farming from childhood. From back in Soviet times, Chynara has been working in animal husbandry and growing crops, which is the main source of income for the family. She started this business with a sum of only 5,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Thanks to her persistent hard work, her farm now includes 2 dairy cows and 10 sheep, and brings in monthly earning of around 7,000 Som from the sale of milk and dairy products. For the purpose of further developing her business, Chynara has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 40,000 Som to buy 2 cows. She plans to re-invest the income generated by this loan into her business by purchasing more head of cattle, and in the future she also plans to repair her house. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1249947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase 2 cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Uchkun village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T17:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T17:30:01Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chynara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-09T20:17:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504880,"name":"Mastula's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mastula\u2019s group is composed of two hardworking women.

married, and has 3 children. Her husband is a businessman, but he does not support his wife. Dilshoda always tries to cope with her problems on her own. She is very grateful to her parents for giving her the opportunity to learn how to sew from a seamstress. Now she sews beautiful dresses and has her own clients. For the purpose of providing her family with all the necessities, 3 years ago she started her own business. Prior to that, she had been a migrant worker in the Russian Federation but was unable to find acceptable work. Dilshoda currently works from home sewing dresses, and thanks to her good service, she has a good number of clients. These clients are women of good taste who are very particular and can be difficult to please, but Dilshoda easily manages to satisfy their demands. She has big plans for the future. She wants to open her own sewing studio and work with new designs and styles. She needs a new sewing machine, but her income is not sufficient for her to be able to afford one. Dilshoda is seeking a loan of 2,500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy a new sewing machine. Her hopes are on you and your kindness. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1249953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy sewing machine to develop her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilshoda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":101.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":119.61},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":128.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":134.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":137.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":148.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":156.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":162.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":164.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740885,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-16T04:34:30Z","paid_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504885,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercedes believes that \"a hard-working person will have a bright future\".
