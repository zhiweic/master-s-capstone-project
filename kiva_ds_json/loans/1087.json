Each year she works a 1.64-hectare plot of land where she plants beans and perennial herbs. Thanks to her hard work, her farm brings in monthly earnings of about 15,000 Som. For the purpose of further developing her business, Dilbara has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 Som to purchase bulls and horses for breeding to improve the stock.

Thanks to her hard work, today her farm includes 1 cow and 25 sheep, and brings in monthly earnings of approximately 10,000 Som. For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulmira has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 Som to purchase more cattle to fatten and sell.

Belmira makes her living selling fish.  For this reason, she gets up very early every day to go to the city's fishing port in order to buy the best fish, that are fresh and of good size.  Once she has all of her fish, she sorts them by species and size, so she can determine a fair price for them.  She then arranges them on a table that she has installed in her place in the market.  \r\n\r\nBelmira has worked in this business for more than 40 years and it is her only source of income.  She always works alone and works all morning.  She admits that sometimes she has felt the urge to leave it all behind because of the intense sun that can be stifling in the mornings, but she knows she needs to work in order to support herself.  Now she is considering the possibility of selling plantains because they are the best dietary complement to fish and her customers are asking for them.  For this she only needs to obtain the necessary funds and get to work.  \r\n\r\nThis is Belmira's 5th loan with Kiva, and she is very happy with the great support each loan offers.  She feels that they allow her family, economic and personal progress to emerge in a secure manner.

Currently, she is only responsible for three of them. They are 22, 19, and 16 years old. She lives with them in her own home, which she built with a lot of effort and dedication. She works manufacturing charcoal. She rents some land far from the city that has been set aside for this purpose, and she works there every day. She buys leftover wood from nearby carpenters, and then she sets up ceramic ovens, where she puts all the wood she has collected. She covers it with sawdust and then lights it, and then waits several weeks until the wood is baked enough to be charcoal. She has had this business for three years, and she says that it is very demanding, but very profitable. She has three workers and occasionally works with her son-in-law. She also sells food in her home in the evenings. What she likes about her work is that she can work and feel useful to her family. It makes her feel good to know that she has more to give to others, even if it isn't much. She says that what she likes most is interacting with people. This is why she hopes that her business keeps growing at the same rhythm. This is her fifth Kiva loan. She is very glad for the financial support that she has received, because she feels confident that she can move forward with her work. She promises to make her payments on time. With the amount she is applying for, 1,500 soles, she will buy assorted boxes of discarded wood to use in manufacturing charcoal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1322950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-29T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-28T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.36,"local_amount":228.39,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":236.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578080,"comment":null},{"amount":95.57,"local_amount":238.94,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":247.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530308,"comment":null},{"amount":95.22,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":246.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975335,"comment":null},{"amount":102.69,"local_amount":256.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:01Z","rounded_local_amount":265.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996604,"comment":null},{"amount":106.52,"local_amount":266.3,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":275.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864086,"comment":null},{"amount":108.64,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":281.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352428,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T19:58:57Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":542903,"name":"Fernando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peruvian artisan Fernando specializes in alpaca apparel.

The population of this area works in raising animals and working in agriculture. In addition, many are involved in the fabrication of traditional clothing and crafts. They are known for their embroidering and tailoring skills.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, the Francisquenses Trust Bank was formed by several enthusiastic women. There are currently 16 members of the group. The women are pleased to have four new members. They are most aware that these new members must be responsible in order to uphold the good credit history of the Trust Bank. During the monthly meetings, the women receive training where they discuss topics such as health, family planning, and children\u2019s rights, as well as business topics including budgeting and planning.\r\n\r\nMagdalena is one of the new members of the Trust Bank. She is 31 years of age and has four children, ranging in age from 18 months to 13 years. Three of the children attend school. She has had two years of formal education, which is the average for the women in her Trust Bank.\r\n\r\nMagdalena and her husband are tailors and make pants and jackets. They work for her brother and are paid by the pieces of clothing that they sew. However, Magdalena\u2019s dream is to be independent, to produce more products and increase her income. After learning about Friendship Bridge and its Microcredit Plus program, she joined the Trust Bank and applied for her first loan in order to buy her own sewing machine. In this way, she can produce her own products and contact wholesalers. In addition, she will be better equipped to support her children\u2019s education, so that they will enjoy a better future, perhaps a professional one!\r\n\r\nThe Francisquenses Trust Bank is most grateful to Friendship Bridge and Kiva investors. With the working capital that they provide in the form of loans, the women can become more independent, create or grow their businesses, and move themselves, their families, and community forward into a brighter future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4438.53,"image":{"id":1319705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

Its members sell used clothing, sell breakfasts at open fairs, work in tailoring, and work in fashion, and his business is auto mechanics and pastry making.  He started his business nine years ago after he got into an accident and had to find other ways to earn an income.  He took an auto mechanics course that he could not complete and he worked in bakeries, where he was able to learn how to make cakes and cookies.  He had to face the loss of his wife and family, who left him on his own after the accident that left him crippled, but Javier had the courage to get ahead and take courses to learn.  Despite this pain in his life, he currently has a partner who has helped him and supported him in every way possible so he can get ahead.  Javier will use this loan to buy supplies for his small pastry shop, as well as a mixer and molds, which are staples for his work.  He is sure that this will be a very good season for his business and thinks he will even be able to make his payments ahead of time.

Everlyne is pictured on the right of the Upendo Group with her hand raised. Everlyne is pictured amongst the 12 women of her group. She will receive input loans capable of planting \u00bd an acre with sorghum, sweet potatoes and millet. Everlyne first enrolled with One Acre Fund during the 2010 Long Rains and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. Everlyne joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seeds and fertilizer, as well as to improve her farming techniques with One Acre Fund methods.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Everlyne was only able to harvest 1.5 bags of maize per \u00bd acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, she was able to harvest 9 bags per \u00bd acre!

Su negocio lo comenz\u00f3 hace dos a\u00f1os, cuando en un curso hecho ne la Municipalidad de San Pedro, pudo capacitarse como manipuladora de alimentos lo que le ayudo a facilitar lo que ahora es su trabajo. Desaf\u00edos ha tenido bastantes, pero  siempre ha sido totalmente apoyada por su familia, y m\u00e1s ahora por su hijo, quien le ayuda a promocionar sus productos por internet y cuando captan clientes es \u00e9l el encargado de ayudarla en el traslado de los productos para que conserven su congelado. Con su esfuerzo y ahorro ha podido comprarse un auto usado y peque\u00f1o, pero que le ha servido para el traslado de sus productos.

Ruby, who is standing on the right side with a green T-shirt and glasses, is one of the members and this is her account of how it has been to participate in Fondo Esperanza. In the communal bank in which she participates, the members, including her, work selling their products in the Candelaria market. Some of them sell used clothing, carts for the market, brushes, ceramics and footwear. \r\n\r\nRuby sells frozen products such as hake, shrimp, frozen french fries and potato puffs, as well as frozen vegetables such as corn, lima beans, green beans, carrots and peas. She started her business two years ago when she took a course in the town of San Pedro, where she was trained in food handling, which helped her get into what now is her business.\r\n\r\nShe has had quite a few challenges, but has always been fully supported by her family, and more now by her son, who helps her to promote her products via the Internet. When they get customers, he is the one responsible for helping her transport the products so that they stay frozen. \r\n\r\nWith her effort and savings she has been able to buy herself a small used car that has been useful in transporting her products. The loan she will be able to access will enable her to stock more products to sell. At this time of year here in Chile, because it is Holy Week, people don't eat meat, only seafood products, and she would sell much more, which would be very good for her business\u2014so she projects that it would be a very good sales period.\r\n\r\nAt Fondo Esperanza, she has got to gotten to know very good people, and besides her participation has been rewarding, also helping her to have a much greater desire to succeed. There is a lot of respect there and help from the advisers. She also tells us that she has made friends through her communal bank, as when the day comes to make a payment for previous loans, they get together with their fellow members and prepare a light meal, making cakes or cookies. In short, a rewarding

with his wife, Etsenia, and their five-year-old daughter in an adobe home. From a very young age, Abel helped his parents work their organic cacao farming operation, and agriculture has always been the livelihood and source of income for his family.\r\n\r\nOver time, as Abel became a father and husband and took on new responsibilities, he decided to start his own farming operation and purchase some farm land for cultivating organic cacao. Abel works extremely hard to tend and cultivate his cacao crops, and during the harvest season he hires additional workers to help with the increased workload. Time is of the essence during the harvest, as cacao fruit cannot be harvested when it is over ripe and still be in compliance with industry standards.\r\n\r\nAfter Abel harvests the cacao fruit, he extracts the seeds and dries them. He sells his seeds to establishments that pay varying rates for high quality versus low quality cacao. Abel has nine years of experience in this trade, and he plans to continue with his farming operation for the benefit of his family.  Abel is very grateful for the opportunity of this, his first loan, and he promises to make all scheduled loan repayments on time. He plans to use the support from this loan to purchase plaster and mortar for use in shoring up and strengthening the walls of his home, which is located in the middle of his farmland.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1323660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase plaster and mortar for strengthening the walls of his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-29T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-28T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":107.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":114.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":124.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":137.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":140.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":103.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":107.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578084,"comment":null},{"amount":47.05,"local_amount":117.62,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":121.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530313,"comment":null},{"amount":45.98,"local_amount":114.95,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975340,"comment":null},{"amount":50.11,"local_amount":125.27,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":129.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996609,"comment":null},{"amount":51.76,"local_amount":129.39,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":133.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864090,"comment":null},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":130.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":134.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352433,"comment":null},{"amount":55.17,"local_amount":137.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":142.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904285,"comment":null},{"amount":56.49,"local_amount":141.22,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":146.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-30T10:36:23Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":543092,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is applying for a loan of $1,000 from TRM (Tuba Rai Metin).

All of this is arduous, and the best way to complete this work is with the support of hired laborers who work continually.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of time and the confidence gained from her years of experience, she hopes to keep working with her characteristic dedication.

As a source of income for the family, Aigul over the course of 17 year began to engage in livestock and agriculture, starting with 17,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nThrough Aigul's hard work, her activities bring in about 7,800 som per month, which is the basis for covering the costs of food and household needs for the family. Income from the business allowed Aigul to expand activities of agriculture and especially livestock - her farm consists of three cattle, two calves, and 12 sheep. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Aigul turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock. Aigul plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her business, and also plans to use part of the proceeds to purchase a car.

","en":"Zumrad is 25 years old, married and the mother of one daughter.  She is the main source of income for her family and has worked with livestock for the past 7 years.  She began her business with only 6,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, Zumrad today has under her care 1 cow with calf and 2 sheep.  She brings in around 15,000 KGS each month from the sale of milk and dairy prodcuts.  With the goal of further developing her business, Zumrad has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy 1 cow with calf and sheep.  The income from the loan will be used to make repairs to her home.

Martin joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. Martin joined One Acre Fund so that he could gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer, and grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Martin was only able to harvest four bags of maize per acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, he was able to harvest 11 bags per \u00bd acre!

She lives in poverty and it's very difficult for her to provide for four children alone.  She works as a nurse as a hospital--a position that doesn't pay well.  She urgently needs to find a source of additional income since her growing children have growing expenses.  With this goal, she has taken the course \"To Get Ahead\" offered by the Women's Business Association and received a certificate of completion.  Now, she is able to begin her own business and become successful at it.  She wants to organize a sewing business since she has a lot of experience in this area.  With the new income, she plans to pay for her children's education and to provide them with high-quality foods.  She is asking for a loan to buy a sewing machine to help get her started.

With the goal of further growing her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 KGS to buy cattle.

He began working for himself after getting married, since this let him work a flexible schedule and save money to buy his first piece of land. He says that starting to work independently was not easy, since he lacked capital to hire workers and had to work doubly hard. This motivated him to grow his business.\r\n\r\nOne of the main activities associated with growing cacao is replacing older plants with plants from the seedling nursery by grafting the stems.

In the future, Rasmi plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.

He comments that as a child he was always very engaged in learning various agricultural activities performed by his parents, thus achieving a firm knowledge about the cocoa production trade including the necessary technical conditions. After finishing high school and facing serious financial difficulties to continue his studies and start college, he decided to venture into the commercial world with the support and trust of his parents. As a way to generate income to help his parents he has been working for over two years on leasing medium-size farmland to proceed with removal of cobs achieving good revenue at the end of the season.\r\nTo optimize production he needs to apply maintenance to the field which starts from replacing outdated plants by new trees through grafting seedlings, for which capital is required, this is why it is necessary for him to ask his financial institution for funds. This maintenance is a collective work to be carried out with the support of workers at the site in order to obtain the desired output.\r\nHe has in mind to keep working on this field, so he can generate solid revenue that will enable him to start college and pursue a career in the agriculture field.

However, it is not enough.  She has four children.  Matluba is a homemaker.  Her husband fattened cattle to sell, and when he had to leave to work abroad, Matluba decided to continue his work.At the moment, Matluba has one cow that gives 10-12 liters of milk.  She sells dairy products to her neighbors and acquaintances.  Her oldest son helps her with feeding the cattle.  Matluba plans to save money to build a home for her oldest son so that after he marries, he won't need to worry about a thing.  In order to reach her goal, she works day and night.  Matluba is asking for a loan to buy another cow as well as fodder for her animals.  Having fattened up the cattle over a period of a few months, she plans to sell them for a good price which will help grow her business..

It allows them to have an additional income source to help pay for their children's education.\r\n\r\nShe says that she likes her business a lot because she keeps it well stocked and sells a little bit of everything, even toys and gifts.  She also sells sandals, soda, and sewing supplies.  She buys her sewing supplies in a village near hers called Zitacuaro.\r\n\r\nShe also says that they started their store so people in her community wouldn't have to travel to other towns to buy what they need and so they wouldn't have to spend money on travelling.\r\n\r\nConchita (the name she goes by) is asking for a loan to stock her grocery store and stock up on sewing supplies so her customers don't go to different places to buy them.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to Vision Fund for the loan that she will give her, since she will be able to stock her store better.

a loan so he can increase his herd.

He has a large family and it is difficult for him to provide for them on his own. Many of his neighbours have gone to Russia as migrant workers, but Abduvohid does not want to leave his family to go to a foreign land, which is why he is trying to earn enough income to take care of them while remaining at home. He plans to use the loan to buy more cattle and expand his business. He is really hoping for financial support from Arvand, and thanks all lenders in advance.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":202.19,"image":{"id":1323161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Asht","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.666667 70.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-03-31T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-30T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abduvohid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":306.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":317.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":327.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":338.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":349.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":360.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.23,"local_amount":306.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":310.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900879,"comment":null},{"amount":67.37,"local_amount":317.05,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":320.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550061,"comment":null},{"amount":69.59,"local_amount":327.48,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":330.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774285,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-01T01:09:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":543436,"name":"Vicente","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicente works full-time with the D.C. government as a waste truck operator.

He is married and has children. He and his family live in the mountains, where he and his wife work in animal husbandry. They have been doing this for several years already. Every 2 weeks, Rasuljon buys cattle, fattens them, and after some time sells them at the same market for a profit. This business brings in a very good income. Having recently heard about the possibility of a loan from acquaintances, Rasuljon has approached Arvand in order to develop his business. His dream is for his children to receive a good education at a post-secondary institution, and to make this happen, he needs to save up a certain amount of money. He plans to use the loan to purchase cattle, and with each sale, to set aside more savings.

","en":"Dilshodbek is an active and hard-working young man. He lives in a rural area, far from the city. He was unable to get a post-secondary education because of family circumstances and difficult times. He began working in his childhood, helping his father who raised him according to the principle that \"for a real man, even 40 professions are not enough.\" In this way, Dilshodbek became a jack-of-all-trades, able to earn a living in various occupations. He is currently selling building materials. He buys them from a supplier and sells them in his village for a profit. He also works in animal husbandry, mainly raising, fattening, and selling both cattle and smaller livestock. This is his main source of income which he uses to pay for his housing and living expenses, and to provide for his children's needs. He has a large family. He has a clever wife and 4 children. His parents and his brothers live with his family, and when he leaves to sell construction materials, his youngest brother and eldest son take over his other duties. Dilshodbek has to seize every opportunity to earn money so his family can live well today and not go hungry tomorrow. He has big plans for his children's futures. He wants them to learn a profession and to never want for anything in the future. To this end, he and his wife are saving up money and do not want to have to spend their little nest egg today. Dilshodbek plans to buy cattle and cattle feed for them, but he does not have enough cash on hand for this purchase. For this reason, he decided to approach MDO Arvand for a loan which he hopes will help him find a solution to his problems.
