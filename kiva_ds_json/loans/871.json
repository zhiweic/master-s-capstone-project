Today, Gioconda has a very well stocked grocery store which she tends every day of the week without a set schedule. \r\n\r\nThe main difficulty that presents itself is that when her children get sick, since she doesn't have help, she has to close the business and so loses sales.

Her husband makes a living as a carpenter and together they have a 16-year-old daughter who studies at the public school. Mar\u00eda tells us that six years ago she opened a store since she had a daughter with special needs and needed additional income for the medical bills. At first, it was a very small store and she had very little of everything.\r\n\r\nSince she needed to increase her sales, she became familiar with D-Miro communal bank. The loans that they have granted have allowed her to increase her business. Currently, in addition to the store, she manages a stationary store. She opens at 7 in the morning until 10 at night every day. When she can't work, her niece helps. She tells us that her area has thieves but she has not had any problems so far. During the interview, we wanted to meet her daughter but she told us that her body did not respond to the treatment and, sadly, she passed away. Now her business has been a refuge because it helps her to clear her mind. With this loan, she wants to stock her business by purchasing supplies, a refrigerator, and other items.

She is 21 years old and at her young age she is a very successful entrepreneur, and is eager to achieve her best personally and financially. She works selling bed sheets, shirts and mosquito nets from place to place.  She learnt this business from her mother with who she goes out selling. Bella likes her work very much since she can organise her time around her sales work, and her salary depends on her sales. She does not have a fixed timetable for work but when she has an order she is very punctual. Her biggest worry is crime since if someone sees her alone they can steal her daily earnings or merchandise.  She is not married but she has two children of 5 and 1 years old, and since she lives in her parents\u2019 house they are looked after by her nieces.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy eiderdown, underwear, bed sheets, mosquito nets.

She lives with her family, which is made up of her husband and son. Mar\u00eda makes and sells tasty tamales and delicious tortillas. She makes her rounds selling in different neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to give her son better conditions than what she and her husband have had. All of this motivates her to keep working, as she is one of the main economic supports of her home. With the idea of insuring her business - which is one of the primary sources of income that she has - Mar\u00eda made the decision to request this loan from Integral to invest in the purchase of some necessary goods, such as chicken, corn, leaf wrappers, vegetables, etc., to make tamales and tortillas. Every day she markets to her neighbors, who prefer her because she is honest, hard-working and responsible. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that with this help she can increase her offerings and as a result, her sales and profits will allow her to reach a better quality of life for herself and her family.

For them it is the most thing in life and they want to give him better opportunities in life than they had. \r\n\r\nThis business is her main source of income. As such it is very important to keep it active and continue pursuing the benefits, which, up until now, she has been satisfied with. She has a few regular customers who are very satisfied with the service she offers. She also has had many good references through her neighbors because she is an honest and hard working woman in addition to being very dedicated to her work. \r\n\r\nShe has thought a lot about how to increase her income and has come to the conclusion that the best way to do so is to invest in merchandise for her store. In this way she will be able to attract more customers and therefor increase her sales as well as her income. This is why she is requesting a loan with INTEGRAL to purchase merchandise for her store, such as oil, rice, sweets, drinks, macaroni, beans, salt, detergent and other products that will allow her to attract more customers. In this way she hopes to achieve her dream of giving her family a better quality of life, distinct from what they currently have.

Every weekend, Don Joselo takes everything he produces to the city of Manta, where they are delivered to traders who are in charge of exporting these items to other countries so that the finishing touches can be added before the products are sold.  Joselo works eight hours a day, Monday through Friday.  He either works alone or with the help of his wife since he does not have a large operation.  The raw material that he uses comes from a warehouse in town that sells it for a good price.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy tagua for making buttons.

With this motivation she came to Integral to request this loan and invest it in acquiring merchandise for her store like: rice, beans, oil, drinks, macaroni, coffee, cleaning products and more items that can attract more customers and which will allow her to increase her sale's levels and income.

This area is known for its rich pre-colonial culture and its handicrafts that are recognized on a national and international level. Most of the residents of this area engage in the manufacture of tagua buttons, handicrafts, and trade in general.\r\n<p>\r\nIt is here that one can meet Sra. Rosa.  She is 34 years old and a single mother of three children (ages 15, 13, and 11) who are attending school.  Rosa lives at her parents' house.  She has been with her Communal Bank for three loan cycles and enjoys the help that the loans have given her.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa is an excellent homemaker, but she also generates her own income by manufacturing buttons out of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phytelephas\" target=\"_blank\" >tagua<\/a>.  She uses a lathe (a machine that cuts the tagua) for making buttons in crude form.  The products are delivered to traders who come to her area to buy them before taking them to Manta, where they are shipped abroad for final processing.  Rosa works every day and has been in business for almost two years.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is repeating the loan process for the same business.  During this past loan cycle, her business did not do very well because of the winter.  She almost came away with no profits.  Rosa hopes to recover with this new loan.  Her business is currently improving with each passing day.  Rosa says that her situation resulted in two delinquent payments, but she was able to get back on track so that she could continue receiving the loans that are very important to her.  She will use the money to buy tagua, the raw material used for making the buttons.  Rosa is now in her fourth loan cycle with her Communal Bank and enjoys the convenience of the payments.  Her dream is to have a large factory with the latest technology.

He has run a chicken rearing business for the last two years (he buys chicks, rears them and then sells them on). This business works wonderfully, however he has only a small amount of working capital and so he is obliged to wait, each time he buys stock, for the chicks to grow so that he can sell them and buy new chicks. This causes him to be out of stock on a daily basis and makes his customers always dissatisfied.\r\nHe is seeking this loan in order to buy in bulk; this will allow him not only to meet the needs of his growing customer base, but also to make a bigger profit. The profit generated from the proceeds of this loan will allow him to grow his business (to increase the number of chicks) and also to meet the family's daily living costs.

They live in their own home and he makes a living farming, specifically farming corn and beans. He has ample experience as he's been making a living doing this work for several years. The land is located in an agricultural area very close to his home. He begins work very early to take advantage of the day, always obtains the best harvests, and does business in the surrounding areas. He has made many customers as people are sure that everything he sells is of the best quality, at affordable prices, and with excellent service. Moreover, he also has the support of a small day job that helps him supplement the household expenses. Salome is a hardworking man and a visionary who is always looking for new opportunities that allow him to better himself and reach success. In the last harvest he suffered a small loss due to the storm called E12 that affected the whole country. He needs to recover and increase his earnings. To do this he would like to increase his production and invest in supplies. For this reason he's requesting a loan from Integral that allows him to buy corn seed, bean seed, tools, fertilizer, insecticides, etc. Salome Gerardo has had other loans and has paid them. He has the assurance that he will pay off his debt in the established time and at the same time trusts that he will give his family a full life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1104980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to buy corn seed, bean seeds, tools, fertilizer, and insecticide.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T10:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T10:50:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salome Gerardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":220,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.7,"local_amount":60.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":61.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331925703,"comment":null},{"amount":163.3,"local_amount":159.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":163.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846924,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-05T04:23:13Z","paid_date":"2013-02-17T11:28:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":432985,"name":"Pc Malicounda Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe de femmes faisant partie d'un banc villageois a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9e depuis 2008.

She has been engaged in these revenue-generating activities for 8 years. She has benefited from 5 loan cycles with the IMF Hekima microfinancing program. \n\nThe developing insecurity in the interior of the province and the unstable macro-economic situation due to fluctuating market prices constitute serious threats to the development of her business activities.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJulie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Julie earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from the variety store, she has a bakeshop where different types of pastries and bread are sold. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJulie hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to give her children a good and high quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Most of the residents of this area engage in the manufacture of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phytelephas\" target=\"_blank\" >tagua<\/a> buttons, handicrafts, and trade in general.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Jessica lives in this place.  She is 27 years old, married, and has three children (ages 10, 9, and 5), all of whom are in school.  Her husband is a merchant.\r\n<p>\r\nJessica helps her husband with the household expenses since he does not earn enough to cover everything.  Five years ago, she started a small restaurant business in her home.  Every day, she prepares delicious fish \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ceviche\" target=\"_blank\" >ceviche<\/a>\" (marinated seafood) in the mornings.  At night, she sells fried pork.  All of her dishes are served with juices, sodas, or other beverages preferred by her customers.  Jessica also uses the loans she receives from her Communal bank to help her husband with his business.  He sells fish and travels around the city to offer his products.  Jessica says that the loans are the only way for the two of them to continue working.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy provisions for the dishes she prepares, as well as fish for her restaurant and for her husband to sell.  She has been with her Communal Bank for three loan cycles and enjoys the assistance the loans have given her.  Her goals are to move forward in her business and to provide a good education for her children.

is 54 and a resident of Bacoor, Cavite City, the Philippines. She has a child who is now in college. Luzviminda has managed to support her child's schooling and she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighbourhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Luzviminda earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them bit by bit for a profit. Her store is adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda dreams of being able to financially support her child through college. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship co-members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

is Vilma, 47, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite City, Philippines. She has been separated from her husband, but by the grace of God, she was able to send three of her children through college (they are now working), and currently two children are in high school. She, together with her older children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVilma operates a meat stall. She buys meat from suppliers that deliver the meat to respective markets and vendors. Her products are pork, beef, and other meat products. There are many patrons who prefer her products since they are assured of their freshness and cleanliness.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies of pork and beef needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVilma hopes to be able to expand her business soon, just as she hopes to have a happy home. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1110018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for additional meat supplies and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4346.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359418,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.98,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3621.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303233,"comment":null},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1334,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1449.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355957,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1448.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114071,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-08T17:39:23Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":433486,"name":"Junibeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Junibeth is 30 years old and single.

She is 25 years old and is married to Luis, who works in agriculture. Erika has a daughter from a previous marriage who goes to state-run school. Erika started her shop because she needed extra income in order to be able to help her husband with household expenses. Her current husband is the one who helped her set it up, and, since the shop is in their house, she can look after her daughter easily. The business is already 3 years old. She now also owns a small general store, which she opens every day. Erika tells us that her biggest problem is criminal activity, since she lives in a slightly desolated place.

Jos\u00e9 nos comenta que en la elaboraci\u00f3n se llevan a cabo una serie de procesos est\u00e1ndar que comprenden desde la elecci\u00f3n del material arcilloso, al proceso de empacado final. La materia prima utilizada para la producci\u00f3n de ladrillos es la arcilla. Debido a la caracter\u00edstica de absorber la humedad, la arcilla, cuando est\u00e1 hidratada, adquiere la plasticidad suficiente para ser moldeada, muy distinta de cuando est\u00e1 seca, que presenta un aspecto terroso. Lego de esto viene la fase de endurecimiento, por secado, o por cocci\u00f3n, el material arcilloso adquiere caracter\u00edsticas de notable solidez con una disminuci\u00f3n de masa, por p\u00e9rdida de agua.

He makes and sells bricks, and started his business with a small capital investment and learned the trade from his brother-in-law. \r\n\r\nManufacturing the bricks involves a series of standard processes ranging from the choice of material to the final packaging process. The raw material for production of bricks is clay. Because of clay's ability to absorb moisture, when hydrated it gains sufficient plasticity to be shaped, which is very different from when it is dry and gains an earthy appearance. After this comes the stage of hardening, drying, or cooking, where the clay gains a remarkable strength with reduced mass due to water loss. In summary, the process is as follows: maturation, storage of the processed raw material, humidification, molding, drying, cooking, storage.

Visitors, too, come from far and wide to admire the unparalleled spectacle of millions of monarch butterflies together in one place.  Gerardo and his wife, Carmina, have 2 children, both in high school.  He tells us that he has operated a bakery business, making a traditional bread, for 3 years.  He is happy with the business and says that his customers like his bread and always come back for more.  He says that he started the business after he was laid off from the company where he worked before and needed a way to support his family and pay for his children's schooling.  His mother suggested that he start a bakery and agreed to show him how to make the traditional bread that is now the mainstay of the business.  Gerardo is applying for a loan that he will use to buy supplies--flour, eggs, milk, butter, yeast, firewood, etc.--for making bread.  He sells what he makes on the streets of the city and people come out of their houses to buy from him.  He is grateful for the loan because it will allow him to buy the supplies that he needs.  He says that his goal for the future is to buy a larger oven because the one he has is too small.  The other members of the group--Teresa, Juana, Imelda, Rosa, Elizabether and Adela--will invest their share of the loan in their businesses which vary from clothing sales to grocery sales."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1104153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to stock their retail businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":433530,"name":"Nera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nera is married and she works hard to support her family.

Su esposo es agricultor con terreno agr\u00edcola propio en el cual tiene sembrado mango y pan llevar. \n\nFilomena desea adquirir alimento balanceado para lograr que sus animales se desarrollen con \u00e9xito y puedan ser vendidos a mejores precios, por ello ha cre\u00eddo conveniente solicitar a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles que le ayuden a lograr su objetivo. Ella ya ha trabajado anteriormente con nuestra instituci\u00f3n y ha demostrado ser una cliente responsable y puntual con sus pagos. \n","en":"Filomena is a 37-year-old mother who lives with her husband and three children in the village of Pueblo Libre.  This rural area is part of the agricultural district of Tambogrande, which is located in the region of Piura and is situated more than four hours away from the city of Chiclayo.  In addition, this area is very poor and the basic services are scarce.  \r\n<p>\r\nFilomena raises small animals, especially poultry such as hens, turkeys, and ducks.  She raises the animals at home and when they reach the ideal size and weight, they are sold at the local market.  Her husband is farmer who has his own land for growing mangoes and other food crops.  \r\n<p>\r\nFilomena wants to acquire balanced feed in order for her animals to develop successfully so that they can be sold at better prices.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan of 1,000 PEN from Edpyme Alternativa to help accomplish this goal.  She has already worked with Edpyme Alternativa on a previous occasion and demonstrated that she is a responsible client who is punctual with her payments.

benjam\u00edn desde hace 13 a\u00f1os juntos han formado una familia con 3 ni\u00f1os dos de ellos van a la escuela\nMary se dedica a la crianza de borregos desde hace dos a\u00f1os la actividad la inicio ya que la idea se la dio su cu\u00f1ada por el momento tiene dos borregos que cuida mucho ya que todas las ma\u00f1ana se levanta a darles de comer pastura, zacate o ma\u00edz molido lo que tenga cuando ve que ya  est\u00e1n muy sucios los limpia, tambi\u00e9n les ofrece agua cuando es muy necesario.\nEsta vez esta solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comparar mas borregos si le alcanza

con mucho gusto y emoci\u00f3n mientras Mari nos contaba sus experiencia con los borreguitos en manera de chascarrillo dijo \u201cY lo que menos me gusta es que lloran mucho y no s\u00e9 porque

integrantes del grupo coinciden  tambi\u00e9n otra dificultad de Mary es que el lugar donde tiene sus borregas es un espacio muy peque\u00f1o.\nLa meta de Mary es que sus hijos terminen una carrera aunque sea corta pero que tengan un trabajo seguro ya que quiere que la calidad de vida de su familia mejore.\nLas integrantes de grupo son Elena invertir\u00e1 en cerdos y pollos, Lura comprara

made up of 8 hardworking and responsible women who work in the fields.  They say that they chose this name (The Swallows) because these small birds are found in the community and ejido (communal farming lands) where they live.  Maria del Socorro (who is affectionately called Mari) is the representative of this group.  She tells us that she is 37 years old and has been married to Benjamin for 13 years.  They have formed a family with 3 children, 2 of whom attend school. \r\n\r\nMari has had a business raising sheep for 2 years.  She started this business because of an idea given to her by her sister-in-law.  She currently has 2 sheep that she cares for very well.  Every morning she gets up and gives them hay, pasture grass or ground corn.  When she sees that they are very dirty she washes them, and she also provides them with water when needed.  \r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting a loan to buy more sheep.  She would like to buy two, and the food to feed them.  What Mari enjoys the most about this work is when her sheep have babies, because she has a sheep that just had a baby and Mari received it with a lot of excitement and pleasure.  Meanwhile, Mari told us about her experience with the baby sheep in a joking manner, saying, \"What I like the least is when they cry a lot and I don't know why.  Perhaps it's because they are very spoiled and so they know that I will give them anything they ask for.\"  She also tells us that it she finds it difficult when her sheep get sick and die, and almost all of the group members agree.  Also, another difficulty that Mari faces is that the place where she has her sheep is a very small space.  Mari's goal is to have her children finish a course of study, even a short one, so that they can have a secure job, because she wants her family's quality of life to improve.  \r\n\r\nThe members of this group are: Elena, who will invest in pigs and chickens, Lura, who will buy pasture grass for sheep, Carmen, who will buy pigs, Candelaria, who will buy chickens and pigs, Maribel, who will buy chickens, Victorina, who will buy pigs and turkeys, and finally, Cristina, who will buy sheep.  The members of the group \"Las Golondrinas del Ejido,\" are sincerely grateful for this loan that is being granted to them by FRAC and by Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1105777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep and pasture grass","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Pedro El Alto, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T21:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T21:20:01Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victorina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":681.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:42Z","rounded_local_amount":9524.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419075,"comment":null},{"amount":681.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":9524.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568651,"comment":null},{"amount":1021.88,"local_amount":14250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":14287.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399941,"comment":null},{"amount":340.62,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4762.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407608,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-12T21:45:23Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":432151,"name":"Martha Asunci\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora se re\u00fane en La parroquia Sequita que pertenece a Montecristi prospero cant\u00f3n manabita, lleno de gente trabajadora, dedicada y orgullosa de sus ra\u00edces, La Sequita es una parroquia donde sus habitantes son gente honesta que solo saben trabajar y dedicarse a sus familias.\n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Martha, tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene cinco hijos de 14, 9, 7, 4  y 1 a\u00f1o, la mayor estudia en colegio y vive con los abuelos ya que es de otro compromiso que tuvo, los dos siguientes estudian en la escuela.

She buys cartons of young baby chicks and raises them for 3 months, then sells them on foot or by the pound to neighbors, or delivers them to local stores. Elena says her chickens sell well, because she raises them on corn, which makes their meat similar to that of creole chickens.  Elena works every day for 2 or 3 hours. Her husband also has farm plots planted in corn and peanuts, which are now being harvested.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more chickens and feed for them, and to pay workers for harvesting the crop.
