Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake.  Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflowers, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes.  Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nGilbert is married and has eight children.  Both him and his wife are farmers, and they are currently growing maize, sorghum, groundnuts, and sunflowers. Gilbert's sunflower crops will be especially good for his bee colonies, as bees enjoy feeding on the nectar from the flowers.  Gilbert is excited to start working with Honey Care because he now has access to modern Langstroth beehives instead of the traditional hives usually used in his region. \r\n\r\nThis is Gilbert's first loan with Kiva, and he plans to use the income generated by his beehives to further invest in beehives and beekeeping equipment.

The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of the tree cover by the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping.

lives and works near Cherengani, in the Kitale region. Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya, and at over 6,300 feet above sea level, Kitale is one of Africa\u2019s most elevated towns. The rich soil of the area makes it one of the nation's biggest maize producing regions, lending it the nickname of \u201cthe breadbasket of Kenya\u201d. Many farmers in the region have started projects planting bluegum trees on their land, which complement the region\u2019s natural forests and provide bees with a variety of food sources. The people around Kitale have been beekeeping for centuries, and the area is dense with strong bee colonies. Ronald is married, and has six children.

","en":"Maisara is a young, 28-year-old mother-of-one and divorc\u00e9e.  She lives with her parents, who were kind enough to take her in after her divorce and give her a place to stay and raise her child.

She knows that the world has more to offer her and that she doesn't want to deny herself parts of the world. She also knows about potential and she knows she can contribute something to the building of a better country. Like many people in this country, when she carries her life's flag forward, she faces obstacles that try to stop her from reaching her goals. Nonetheless, perseverance, optimism, and the always unconditional help from selfless people along the way are part of the necessary conditions for her to get ahead, from the darkest shadow to the budding of a dream. \r\n\r\nXiomara, who is writing this letter, grew up in a neighborhood that was a little harsh and difficult for a girl like her. But this wasn't the end that was awaiting her. That is why she decided to go down the difficult road and not just go with the flow. She set a goal and started to work for herself. She wants to be a doctor and help children in the community where she lives, doing everything possible to ensure that these children have a window of opportunity so that these innocents can have the dreams that define them come true. Right now she is studying nursing. She is in her third semester and she is more motivated than ever. The expectations that she had at first have been achieved satisfactorily. Right now, she is certain of finding the path she wanted. She is decided to go down the road till the end. That is why today she works a half shift as a domestic assistant, receiving half a salary to pay for the ticket to get to where she wants. Nonetheless, this is a time when her resources are limited day to day, since because of different reasons, her salary is being reduced.  \r\n\r\nSince she started to study nursing, and as the days go by, she sees the possibility of being a doctor get closer everyday. Medicine and being able to help people are her passion and now she is doing her training n several hospitals she sees how the dream that she has is starting to take shape. Nonetheless, the dream goes beyond that and she knows that nursing is only a step that will help her grow, becoming a source of income that in the future, with dedication, hard work, and savings, will guarantee her going to the university.\r\n \r\nNursing will guarantee her a stable income, and allow her to support her nephew who came into the world with learning problems. Nursing will also help her to pay for tuition and later specialization to keep ascending in her work, seeking better income.  \r\n\r\nThis letter was written with the purpose of getting help from Kiva to continue with her dream, to break the cycle that many people unfairly have to live in this country because they are poor. This agreement will guarantee help for enterprising people so that they can in turn extend that help to people who need it in the future.  \r\n\r\nThank you.

She has a high school education and her outlook on life is optimistic, as she knows exactly what she wants and she seeks it with all her might.  Kimiya knows how to properly spend and budget her money to achieve her goals.  She has been involved in raising livestock for 15 years, which is the main source of income for her family.  Kimiya started this business with the purchase of livestock for 30,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, her farm now has three dairy cows, one horse and 28 sheep.  \r\n\r\nShe has all the facilities for keeping animals: a barn in which to keep her livestock and pastures for roaming.  Her dairy cows are kept on the farm all year long and she looks after them herself, but her sheep are tended by a shepherd from March to October.  She provides sufficient quantities of hay and feed for the animals.  Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her farming business further, Kimiya has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy cows so she can increase her head of livestock.  She plans to use the income from this loan to further increase her head of livestock, as well as to save up money to improve her financial situation."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1495888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chonkara villlage","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T14:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T14:40:16Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kimiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":648697,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Please meet 43-year-old Mary from Liberia.

Every month, they send part of their salary to their mother in Kyrgyzstan as financial support.  Jumgaul's youngest daughter lives with her and helps her around the house.  For a long time after her husband's death, Jumgaul found it very difficult to live through the loss of someone so close to her.  She needed to raise and care for her daughters, so she decided to take the responsibility for her household into her own hands.  \r\n\r\nJumgaul has been involved in raising livestock since 1983, a business she started with the purchase of one cow for 1,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work and support, her monthly income is now 5,000 som KGS and her farm now has four dairy cows which she milks twice a day.  She makes tvorog (quark), kefir and sour cream from their milk and sells it to retail customers.  With the goal of increasing her head of livestock, Jumagul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan so she can buy one cow to raise up.  She plans to use the income from this to further increase her head of livestock, as well as to make repairs to her home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1495920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Birinchi-May village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jumagul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3511},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3615},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3846},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3837},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3985},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4069},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4216},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4316},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4444},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4590},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4712},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4859}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.43},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-24T01:50:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":649163,"name":"Walther Ricardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Walther tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad estado civil Uni\u00f3n Libre vive con su esposa  y con sus hijos, de 4, 2,3 y 1 a\u00f1os.

old. She is a native of the town of Isfara. Musharafkhon is married and with her husband is raising two sons. Their sons are 21 and 19 years old. One of the reasons that Musharafkhon's husband loves her so much is that she cooks so deliciously. Musharafkhon, like many Tajik women, knows how to cook and strives for her dishes to be enjoyed by her husband. In Tajikistan, especially in the districts and villages there are few cafes and dining halls, because the majority of women know how to cook.

Little by little she created her products and began to sell them to her neighbors and friends. She added in clothing which added to her income. This has generated income which supports her husband with the household finances.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is seeking will be used to invest in the purchase of supplies and merchandise at wholesale (fabric, thread, paint, ceramic figurines, etc.).  This will allow her to continue to work and offer more variety to her customers.  It will also allow her to fulfill the orders she already has, and will increase her sales and income. Martha states that her future plans are to strengthen and grow her business even more with the aim of generating job opportunities for some family members who need it and thereby improve the quality of life for her whole family.

","en":"Mohinisso is a hard working woman. She was born in 1988 and is married and has small children. She has never had a job. She decided to form her own busines, since she needs to earn money. She decided the business should be raising livestock because she lives in a rural area and has the right set up for this work.

His sons work in Russia, but they send money for their wives and children to live on, so he can not ask them for support. He contacted MDO Arvand for a loan to buy livestock. This is not his first loan from Arvand. With the help of the credit this time he plans to buy a cow to develop his business.

She has a college education, having graduated from university with a degree in bio-ecology. She began working in a high school, then got married but continued working. Gulira is naturally very responsible, sociable, and cheerful. Currently she is on maternity leave to care for her baby. Gulira and her husband farm and raise livestock. They started 10 years ago with 30,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. Thanks to hard work, they now own 2 dairy cows, a horse, two calves, and forty sheep. Their monthly income is 4,000 som (KGS) from milk sales. They also farm on 2 hectares, growing mainly beans and potatoes. They sell the harvest to wholesale suppliers. With the goal of further developing the business Gulira contacted the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy foals to expand their herd.

With a career in accounting, she expects to earn $25 a day."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1495769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for graduation fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Tarija","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-21.535486 -64.729557","type":"point"}},"partner_id":264,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T16:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T16:20:12Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":802,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T20:52:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":648881,"name":"Aureia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aureia runs a kiosk that helps her to generate income for her family.

Salamat has a college education, having graduated from university with a degree in economics and management. In 2006 she married Omurbek, and is currently the loving mother of two children, and a good wife. From 2010 to 2011 she worked as an accountant and cashier for the town government. Salamat is naturally very responsible, sociable, and cheerful. She began raising animals right after marriage, specifically in 2006, with 20,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. After the land reforms and redistribution of land plots she also began to farm. Thanks to her tireless work, she now has three milk cows, eight horses, and thirty sheep.

When he was growing up, he noticed how difficult their financial situation was for his mother, his twin brother and his older brother, Vincent, who is now deceased.  His mother, who is also deceased, worked in a flower company where she became sick.  After working there for many years, the chemicals that she worked with made her sick, and there was no cure.  \r\n\r\nWatching his mother suffer and seeing the disgust that she had for his father who never lived with them and never cared about their wellbeing, led him to become very preoccupied and anxious.  When he was 8 years old, his older brother died.  This situation was very difficult for his mother, and she cried everyday.  However, in the midst of all of this she was very strong and pushed the twin brothers ahead in primary school and high school before her passing.  \r\n\r\nThey have lived most of their  life in rented houses and it was very hard for their mother to pay the rent and their basic needs.  She was very responsible with the payments and made do with what little income she had to get him and his brother ahead.  Their mother provided them with their values and told them not to be influenced by bad friends because there is always a limit and they should set boundaries.  \r\n\r\nThanks to the efforts of his mother and the grace of God, they were able to finish high school.  Despite the financial difficulties their mom had, she always taught them that the only way to achieve a dignified and good life was through education, and without school they would not have a better future.  Their mother died in 2010, for her twin brother and him it has been difficult to get past the death of the only person who supported them emotionally and financially.  \r\n\r\nSix months ago, they started studying in Campo Alto (A college in Bogota), and they have learned a lot during this time.

Her oldest son is working in Russia. The rest of the children are in school. Ainakhan has a vocational high school education - she graduated from the vocational school for light industry in 1989, after which she worked as a technician in a sewing shop. However, once the Soviet Union fell, she stopped working and began to raise animals with her husband, starting 23 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work, she now has a milk cow, a mare, two foals, a heifer, and eighteen sheep. Her monthly income is 13,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop the business, Ainakhan contacted the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy steersto feed and then sell at the market for a profit. She plans to invest income from the loan into further expanding her livestock herd, and she also plans to save money for her son's wedding.
