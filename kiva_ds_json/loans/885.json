","en":"Odinakhon is 46 years old. She is a widow with three children and lives with her youngest son. Odinakhon works as a nurse in an outpatient clinic for drug addicts in the city of Osh. Her son makes gravestones. To supplement her income, 10 years ago Odinakhon started a livestock and small farming business with a start-up sum of 15,000 Kyrgyz soms (KGS) or approximately $317 USD. Thanks to her persistent efforts, Odinakhon was able to build a home for her family. To further develop her business, Odinakhon applied to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 135,000 KGS ($2875 USD) to purchase four calves for breeding and milking. Odinakhon plans to invest the loan in the future development of her

She is married and has four children. Her youngest son is four years old. Zhanyl works in the local registration office. To supplement her income, she has a livestock and small farming business started with 10,000 Kyrgyz soms (KGS) or approximately $212 USD. Thanks to her persistent efforts, Zhanyl now has a cow, calf, and heifer and one hectare of land growing beans and peppers.

En su hogar su esposo trabaja, con una prestigiosa universidad en su sede campestre; adem\u00e1s del negocio de tienda Berenice, tambi\u00e9n vende fritos todas las tardes, en un sector muy concurrido del municipio, donde ofrece empanadas, carima\u00f1olas (un amasijo de yuca relleno de carne, queso o pollo que se consume frito.) arepas con huevo, papas rellenas y la especialidad de la casa que es \u201cla arepa rellena de carne con huevo\u201d; para el desarrollo de este \u00faltimo negocio, es apoyada por su cu\u00f1ada en la tienda,  mientras Berenice est\u00e1 en la fritanguer\u00eda.

She has a store that she opened 5 years ago in the town of Puerto Colombia, on the seashore.  She found an unoccupied space with no competition nearby.  There is an important sales potential that Berenice hasn\u2019t been able to capture since she doesn\u2019t have enough working capital. When she needs to restock, since there are products that turn over quickly, she must again go to buy, raising the transport costs and often leaving her customers unsatisfied.  Her husband works in the home town at a prestigious university at the country campus.  Besides the store Berenice also sells fried food every afternoon in a busy area of the town where she offers empanadas (stuffed pies) carima\u00f1olas (yucca meal stuffed with meat, cheese or chicken that are eaten fried), arepas with eggs (typical Colombian pancake-like item), stuffed potatoes, and the specialty of the house \u201cmeat stuffed arepas with eggs\u201d.  Her sister-in-law helps her with this part of the business by being in the store while Berenice is doing the frying.  Her future goal is to enlarge her store, have diversified products and convert it into a well-organized self-service establishment.  Until this happens Berenice works with a lot of effort to obtain a margin of no less than 20% and a turnover of inventory of 18 days, financial indicators that will project her growth.  Now she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first that she will have with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and she will use it to buy food, provisions, meat, and groceries in large quantities with which she will increase her stock.  These will be directed at the necessities of her potential customers, so that she can have a consistent amount of business in her store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1122931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy provisions, food, meat, and groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-23T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-23T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Berenice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338960,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775261,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387261,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994093,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130456,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519327,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071167,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497389,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527222,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":93030,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927998,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-19T06:33:06Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":440855,"name":"Hilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hilda tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y vive junto a su conyugue y a su madre en el distrito de Cayalt\u00ed, una zona agr\u00edcola y comercial ubicada a una hora de la ciudad de Chiclayo, capital de la regi\u00f3n Lambayeque.\n\nSe dedica desde hace 10 a\u00f1os a la venta de queso, huevos, aceitunas y embutidos en uno de los mercados de la zona en donde reside.

She started her business in 1992 with 10,000 Kyrgyz soms (KGS) or approximately $212 USD.

Como cada vez mas crece su clientela y aumentan las exigencias de calidad, Diana est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 una fileteadora industrial de segunda y materiales como telas, hilos, aplicaciones y accesorios, para desarrollar nuevos dise\u00f1os ajustados a la moda y a los pedidos de su exquisita clientela. ","en":"Diana is 24 and owns a sewing workshop located in the Puerto Colombia municipality, where she lives with her husband and 8-month-old baby. She taught herself to sew using an old family sewing machine given to her by a relative. Later, she took a course from SENA, the Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (National Apprenticeship Service) and perfected her technique. She now takes courses on the internet. Diana's customers live in Puerto Colombia, where she lives and has her workshop. Puerto Colombia is a municipality on the seashore very close to the city of Barranquilla. She says that the busy season for her is in December, at which time she hires workers for processing in order to serve her clients effectively. As her customer base keeps growing and demanding quality, Diana is requesting a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy a second-hand industrial sewing machine as well as items such as thread, fabric, applications and accessories in order to make more designs in keeping with current fashions and her customers' orders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1123880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy an

","en":"Jaime, age 27, owns a store located in the municipality of Puerto Colombia, on the shores of the sea. He lives with his wife and two children ages 2 and 4. At a very young age, Jaime started working as an assistant in a store owned by a merchant from the interior of the country. He gathered experience from his boss and his day-to-day work over four years. He then poured this experience into his own enterprise in a highly-populated sector with unpaved roads. Jaime says that he has enough experience and social understanding to offer a good service and accommodate customers who have scarce resources; he will sell just one tomato or a half bar of soap. On top of selling groceries, on the weekends he also sells beer, taking advantage of his municipality's tourist appeal. For this, he gives free rein for sharing music and turns on a powerful sound system, setting out plastic chairs and tables on his terrace. He says that \"strangely, it is the poorest men who most consume liquor on the weekends; in keeping with the phrase, \"No hay borracho pobre ni cobarde\" [\"There are no poor nor cowardly drunks\"].\r\nJaime hopes to expand both his businesses. For this reason he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will purchase groceries, meat, and supplies, which will allow him to have an additional working capital with which to buy stock, improve his stock, and rotate his merchandise more rapidly. This will generate him a slightly higher income."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1123863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

is friendly and hardworking man of 39. He is married and has two daughters.  He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his family in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement.  He breeds cattle and has 10 years of experience in this field.  Sadiq gets financial support from the government, but 100 AZN is too small an amount to cover his family's needs.\r\n \r\nCattle breeding requires a lot of physical activity and spending most of the time in the open air.  Pasturing takes 80% of Sadiq's time. He usually buys small calves and then raises and fattens them for 5-6 months and resells them for a profit in the livestock bazaar.

He receives 120 AZN of financial support from the government monthly, but this is too low to cover family needs.\r\n\r\nYusif usually buys small cattle and then raises and fattens them in 5-6 months and resells them at profit in the local livestock bazaar. He sells milk and yoghurt to the neighbors. Milk and meat sales bring 250 AZN of income per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolma and they always use yoghurt sauce.  Milk products are considered very healthy and are present in everyday life. \r\n  \r\nThis is the only financial income in his family and not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children.

Diana has always enjoyed the retail trade and previously sold clothes for a living, but she saw that the food business was more profitable.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 21,000 HNL so that she can invest in the purchase of supplies for preparing food and other products.  This will help maintain the inventory of her business and result in more earnings.  Her goal is to continue working so that her business can grow.  On a personal level, she hopes to develop as a businesswoman and have a better standard of living.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":765.15,"image":{"id":1121626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for making her dishes as well as fried dough, ice cream, and soft drinks to sell.

is a resident of Malindi, Kenya. She is a married mother of two school-going children. She owns a retail shop which has been in operation for three years and has been a source of constant income to the family. She received the start-up capital from her husband. In this shop, she sells sugar, cooking oil and washing detergents amongst other things. Besides this business, Grace is also a vendor of water.\r\nShe learnt of Milango from a company employee and joined in order to access credit for her business. Grace is asking for a loan of 21,050 Kenyan shillings to purchase retail stock like cereal, sugar, cooking fat etc.\r\nGrace is optimistic that her sales will increase and she will finally open another retail shop.

","en":"Paola is 30 years old and works in her sales business in order to support her household.  She sells electrical appliances, cosmetics and clothing on credit.  She also sells drinks such as soda and beer for cash.  When she was 19 years old, Paola finished her high school education, brought up by her parents who are very hard-working people with good habits.  When her husband gave her some start-up capital, she was able to make use of these personal values to start up and manage a sales business.\r\n\r\nPaola was married at 21 and is the mother of two children who are 2 and 7 years old.  She dreams of helping her children become successful people and so she takes care to educate them and work hard so that she can teach them the same values that her parents taught her.  Paola started her business four years ago and she has gradually attracted a number of regular customers who, in turn, refer her to new customers.  For this reason, the working capital she has with which to buy goods and respond to demand has become insufficient and she must wait to recover the money she is owed for her goods before she buys more.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan (her fifth loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use the money to buy a chiller cabinet so that she can increase her sales of beer and soft drinks which makes her very good profits and is a cash-based business.  With her previous loans, Paola managed to increase her business.  This is reflected in her increase in sales which has made her more income and enabled her to continue making progress in improving her family's well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1123978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a

Currently, he is applying for a new Kiva loan, which he will use to purchase implements such as cooking pots, ladles, and grinders. Additionally, he will purchase supplies so he can invest in a greater quantity of raw materials and a larger number of soft drinks. With this investment, he will improve his customer base, as well as his sales. Sofanor will be happy because his earnings will improve. His message to Kiva financiers is: \u201cThank you very much for your support. I had difficulties when my cooler was damaged, but luckily, I managed to overcome that situation and repay my loan. I hope that you will continue to support me so I can continue to strengthen my business.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1124104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase implements such as cooking pots, ladles, and grinders, as well as supplies.

is 34 years old and a hard-working father of two school-aged children. He lives with his family in a small village in Kampong Chhnang province. Hong is in two businesses at the same time: rice husbandry and construction. He manages his rice farming in the rainy season, which lasts from May to October. Aside from this, he works in construction with his team for additional income. Hong is married to Chhun, age 33, who works as a sewing worker in a garment factory in the province to help provide income.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of a family-owned vehicle, Hong\u2019s family is experiencing difficulties in transportation.

She has had a stall in the city center where she sells casual footwear since she arrived in the city of Barranquilla eighteen years ago. She arrived from the department of Antioquia with the hope of finding new horizons since the market in the municipality where she had lived was very saturated. She also sold made-to-order clothing on credit there. When she arrived in Barranquilla she identified shoe sales as a better business strategy for its cost. That is why she started with this product, which has gone very well for her. She hopes to grow her business at every turn until she can achieve total financial stability. When she started her business, Yolanda needed to work very hard, but little by little she has capitalized on her efforts and acquired  two commercial stalls where she works. In one of them she sells flip-flop sandals and general casual footwear, and in the other one she sells paper products. Using the fruits of her labor over a long period, she purchased her own home, which she has been adapting and making nicer, with three bedrooms, so her family can be comfortable. Yolanda purchases her merchandise with cash in a municipality located on the north coast of Colombia that she travels to twice a week. She later sells her merchandise for cash in her commercial stalls, and on 30-day credit for various customers. Currently, she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she is receiving from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

furniture factory for 7 years. \r\nHowever, later he decided to start his own business. He rented out a small room, re-equipped it into a furniture manufacturing facility, and now manufactures cabinet furniture to order. Kitchen furniture is the most wide-spread order. As of today, Alexander already has 2 high-quality wood-working machines that only experienced furniture-makers can afford. \r\nAlexander invests a lot into his business, sets clear objectives and works hard.  He asks for a loan of 15,000 hryven to purchase an edge-beveling machine. This machine will help Alexander manufacture furniture of better quality as well as allow him to speed up the manufacturing process.\r\nThe additional earnings from the loan will help Alexander buy a new car and, perhaps, build a garage. Alexander intends to develop his business; therefore, he will need the necessary equipment, and he is planning on turning to KIVA for support.\r\nNB: the background information is in Russian

is 47 and lives with her husband in Ger, a slum district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her children are grown and live separately. Algirmaa has been running a fruit and vegetable retail business for 12 years. She rents a stall at Tosa fruit and vegetable market and buys her products from wholesalers. Her husband works for Ulaanbaatar city\u2019s public trash collecting company as a controller and earns $210 a month.\r\n\r\nThey own a small plot of land with an old wooden house on it. The house is very old, and it needs renovation, especially insulation and a new roof. It loses heat very quickly during winter, and leaks during summer rains. A well-insulated house uses about two tons of coal for heating during winter, but Algirmaa\u2019s house uses twice as much coal, and thus it makes twice as much heavy smoke polluting the air. Ulaanbaatar has been nominated by UNDP as the worst capital city regarding air pollution during winter. \r\n\r\nAlgirmaa is asking for a loan to buy 250 roof tiles, 50 pieces of rock wool insulation for the wall and roof and other necessary tools. The whole project will cost 2,500,000 MNT, but she will cover some costs from her savings.

He started his business after he arrived in Barranquilla from Bogot\u00e1, the lovely capital of Colombia. He had been transferred there in 1988 when he was working for a financial institution. This business eventually failed, but Pedro received some money for the time he\u2019d worked. He used this money to buy a business which generated enough income to support his wife and two children, now aged 15 and 27. \r\n\r\nPedro recently started selling small appliances in his store. He bought them at good prices from warehouses, and they bring in additional income. His business has been in operation for 13 years, and the majority of the sales are for cash. As well, he has some suppliers who let him buy on credit. Sales are both in cash and on credit. \r\n\r\nThrough determination and hard work, Pedro has managed to acquire two spots in the public market. With the help of his wife who works for a state company, he has managed to provide his family with a good standard of living. One daughter has already qualified as a professional, while their son is still studying. A lot of effort and hard work has ensured that the family has a decent home. \r\n\r\nNow Pedro is seeking a loan, the first he\u2019s had with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to buy supplies wholesale and in large quantities for lower prices which he can pass on to his customers, who are the reason why he is in business."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1124158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy supplies at wholesale prices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-24T18:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-24T18:00:33Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Alvaro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73018},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84389},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86358},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88373},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":90435},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":92545},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":94705},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":96915},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":99176},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":101490},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":103858},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118738}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":441499,"name":"Sabina Natividad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"SABINA NATIVIDAD tiene 26 a\u00f1os es soltera, tiene 2 hijos de 2 y 8 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposo e hijos en la ciudad de Montalvo Provincia de lo R\u00edos.\n\nVRC.

Then he decided to become independent, created his own business, and began selling juice and dairy products on the street.\r\n\r\nLater, with some savings he had, he increased his sales by investing in basic goods for the store. Then, through his own efforts and the help of his father, he set up a business in his home. He bought a freezer to keep his goods fresh, and display cases to exhibit his merchandise. His wife helped him with the administrative details of his business while he went off on motorcycle to sell to some areas near his community. \r\n\r\nHis hope is to increase the amount of merchandise he has for his business, with the objective of increasing his sales. He needs the loan for the purchase of goods like milk, cream, cheese, rice, soap, sugar, etc. He thinks the loan will help him because he can move forward with the business by having what the clients ask for the most. His plan for the future is to increase the size of his business. His next goal is to keep working at his business, to earn more, to repay the loan, and to help his family get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1124172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"for the purchase

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalog, and this is how dealers earn a profit. Marciana also has a dress shop for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Marciana is requesting a loan of PHP 20,000. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMarciana dreams of renovating her house and growing her business in the coming years.

He is married and has 7 children, 5 of whom he is in charge of. Pablo is an agricultural worker and sows beans and corn for a living. He started in this activity by helping his parents working the lands. Then, when he was 18 years old, he decided to become independent, and started sowing on his own, with his own money, since before that he had been working taking care of a farm nearby the community. But that income was not enough to cover the expenses of the sowing, which is why he looked for the support of financial institutions in order to invest more in his business. His eldest sons, who are 25 and 23 years old, help him with the agricultural work, and he also hires a farm laborer. Pablo sells his products in the region where he lives to avoid transportation costs. Besides working in agriculture, Pablo works as a security guard for a private company, in order to earn some extra income for his family. Pablo requests this loan to pay for labor and to buy supplies and fertilizers, which he needs in order to sow beans and corn this year. This loan will be very helpful since it will allow him to better prepare the lands and get a better yield from the harvest. His plans for the future are, to repay the loan with the profits earned from the harvest, and with the money left, make some improvements to his home. His next goals are to keep his business active and generate a better income so that he can pull through together with his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1124212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for labor and to buy supplies and fertilizers \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-24T19:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-24T19:30:08Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo Antonio \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":183.22,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":91.61,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308448994,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":91.61,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531022,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T03:20:38Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:36:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":441645,"name":"Topchugul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0443\u0433\u0443\u043b 58 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0443\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0432  \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441  \u0432 1994 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u044b \u0432 8,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS). \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0443\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443  \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0443\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0432 \u0435\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f 4 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0441 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438, 15 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430, \u0435\u0436\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c \u043e\u0442  \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 15,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS). \u0412 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0445 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430, \u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0443\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u00ab\u0411\u0430\u0439 \u2013\u0422\u0443\u0448\u0443\u043c \u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0440\u044b\u00bb \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0435 100,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS)  \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430  -

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Jovita is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJovita hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good future and high quality education through all her hard work.

She is married and studied through the sixth grade. She has five children, four of which she is caring for, who are studying in secondary school. She makes a living in sales, selling construction materials, which she has been doing for four years. She started this business with savings that her husband had. They started with a small inventory, and later with the support of financial institutions, they were able to invest more in the business by buying a truck to transport their products to other areas. But that was not good enough. Sonia's dream was to be independent and a great businesswoman, with motivation to open a second business. \r\n\r\nToday, thanks to her efforts and her daily hard work, she has had a grocery store, which has been open for six months, which she runs out of her home. In her business she has the support of two of her children, who help her to sell the construction materials, while her daughter attends to the customers in the grocery store. Her husband works as a driver for a private company, to provide another source of income, and provide for the household expenses. Her goal is to increase business in the grocery store by adding new products.   \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan to buy basic grains, rice, beans, oatmeal, sugar, cosmetics and medicines, to be able to offer a variety of products. She believes that the loan will be of help to stock her grocery store, to attract more customers, and at the same time generating more profits. Her plans for the future include paying off her loan with the profits generated from the business, and to open her third business, which will be a small restaurant, because she is a person who is very driven to get ahead. She aspires to be one of the best business owners in the area. Her expectation is to maintain the businesses and to keep moving forward with her family and to have a better future.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1124281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy basic grains, rice, beans, oatmeal, sugar, bread, cosmetics and medicine.

She is married and has children. She and her children manage their own household while operating the business. Aida works hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAida operates a biscuit retailing business. She buys biscuits from a wholesaler, repacks them and sells them per piece\/pack for a profit. Products can range from crackers to cookies and other such products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options Aida offers. She also does direct selling for additional income. Aida's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Aida is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan, which she will use to buy more quantities and varieties of biscuit products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAida hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future and her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance
