However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Aghavni is now able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Aghavni and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain and develop their agribusiness."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1483474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a cow and some forage (grass and barley).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Dalarik village of Armavir region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T04:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T04:00:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aghavni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":131.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":133.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":134.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":135.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":137.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":138.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":141.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":141.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":143.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":145.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":145.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":148.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":148.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":149.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":151.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":152.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":153.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":154.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641102,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is a married woman with 10 children.

With the help of his wife, Grigor sells the agricultural products in the local market which is the main source of their income.<br \/><br \/>He currently needs to make some investments in his agribusiness in order for it to function in a productive and sustainable way. A loan of 1,000 USD will help him greatly by enabling him to purchase tomato and cucumber seeds as well as cellophane for greenhouse construction. He has previously taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately he wasn't able to pay it back; however, thanks to his hard work during recent times, Grigor was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments.

Throughout her working life she was employed as a salesperson at a grocery store and now she is the owner of that very store.  Her previous boss offered to sell it to her and she accepted the offer.  She works every day and is able to generate enough income to cover basic household needs.  Her drive, vision, perseverence and optimism allow her to overcome the diverse obstacles she meets, especially the many competitors she has in the sector.  But she has known how to manage the situation and has taken advance of the fact that the store is well established in the market.\r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a loan to buy wholesale goods (dairy products, baked goods, personal hygiene products, beers, sodas, etc.) so she will have enough supply for the increased demand over the approaching Christmas season, which is when sales increase considerably.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth dreams of expanding her business and seeing it become a well-positioned establishment in the market.  This is so she can invest more money and see it grow and last over time, to improve her son's quality of life and offer him a comfortable lifestyle and a good education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1482476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy wholesale goods (dairy products, baked goods, personal hygiene products, beers, sodas, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Copacabana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71396},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73372},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75403},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77490},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79635},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81839},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86433},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88825},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91284},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93811},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96407}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T23:26:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640541,"name":"Hortencia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hortencia tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en el distrito de Niepos que pertenece a la Provincia de San Miguel, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda a dos horas de la ciudad de Cajamarca, sierra norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nTiene una panader\u00eda ubicada en su domicilio donde se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de pan, bizcochos, tiene una experiencia de cinco a\u00f1os es muy conocida en la zona.\n<p>\nHa solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 2 000 nuevos soles para la compra de insumos harina, polvo de hornear, az\u00facar entre otros para incrementar su producci\u00f3n para ofrecer a sus clientes y de esta manera generar ingresos para una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"Hortencia, 50, lives in the district of Niepos which belongs to the province of San Miguel.

girls and a boy. Her husband is a builder who works privately on a by-order basis. In his spare time, he helps Nazgul take care of the household and farm. Nazgul is a very hardworking and patient woman. Despite that fact that she has young children, she successfully manages to raise her children, feed them and spend time with them. In order to provide for a good future for her children, Nazgul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nazgul's hard work, she currently has 8 milk cows on her farm. Nazgul milks the cows herself and sell the milk for profit. Her monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Nazgul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Nazgul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for the future education of her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1483444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chet-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T14:16:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653170,"name":"Delta Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geoffrey, who is in his early 40's, is married with four children who are still in school.

As the Kiva group representative, Jacob is pictured on the right of the Bidii Group with his hand raised.\r\n\r\nJacob is married and has six children. He is 42 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Jacob has been a farmer for 18 years. Jacob described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJacob first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Jacob joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Jacob plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, buy a goat and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Jacob\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Jacob and the Bidii Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1483514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":331638,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331638}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T06:55:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653201,"name":"Sunguchini Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha is a widow aged mid-40s.

She is pictured here in a group of One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 36 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Emma has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEmma is married and has three children.  She is 25 years old and is known as friendly, hard-working, reliable and trustworthy and an experienced farmer. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's prayer group and burial committee.  Emma has been a farmer for eight years.  Emma described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEmma joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Emma joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  Because she is an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Emma has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Emma's life because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and was able to feed the family.  In the future, Emma hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and a goat and invest in a business.  \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEmma and the Mulika Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1483540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cost-efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moureen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":240705,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240705}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T00:07:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641211,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is a 23-year-old married man who has one child.

studied and graduated from the Medical Institute with a specialty in microscopic and laboratory analysis. She always wanted to have her private business built on her specialty, and in 1993 she was finally able to establish it. With over 10 years experience she remembers that one of the main challenges for her to start up her business was the fact that the nature of her business obviously requires her to be located close to doctors and clinics. This means being new in an area where such businesses and offices are concentrated in, where rent is expensive, space is difficult to find, and establishing reputation as a newcomer is challenging.\n\nZainab has not only overcome those initial challenges, by now she has built a reputation through her precise work and genuine work ethic. Respected by peers and family, Zainab speaks highly of her husband who has been supporting her in all her endeavours. With such support Zainab is not only a successfully laboratory owner, but she is also a respected mother of 4 children.\n\nHer children and husband are proud of her achievements, and Zainab has more ambitious goals to attain in the future. She would like to continuously improve to eventually become the best in her city and accredited by the doctors and clinics in the area.\n\nHer growing business and enthusiasm built on a truly scientific foundation qualifies Zaineb to participate in the WLIFT special training program for SME clients and have also made her eligible to take a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq to purchase a new machine with all its utilities for hormone analysis.\n\nAs she explains with her own words: I\u2019m Zainab, Laboratorial Assistant (this is the official title for graduates from Technical Colleges with Diploma \u201ctwo year study\u201d), I would like to get a loan from Relief International for the purpose of purchasing an analysis\/system device to improve\/speed up my work. Thank you very much.  \n\nIn addition to the investment in the business, from the training Zainab hopes to gain in-depth knowledge to develop the business and serve her clients better through improved administrative and management skills."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":12500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1501052,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2912,"youtubeId":"6imU-NGvHSw","title":"Kiva Borrower Zainab from Iraq","thumbnailImageId":1501048},"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"to purchase a hormone analysis machine with all its utilities for the lab","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2014-01-02T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":12500,"lender_count":369,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zainab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":12500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":12500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":702},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":702},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-04T21:18:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653293,"name":"Group 17 - An Thanh 01","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Man, 43, works in agricultural production and earns a monthly income of approximately 700,000 VND.

As a little girl she would make clothes for her dolls. With this love and passion she developed her skills and became a professional seamstress. With skill, passion, and ambition she grew the business and currently employs 3 other seamstresses. It is also used as a facility to train other women who would like to learn and work in this sector.  \n\nAt the start of the business she faced many challenges; one of the biggest ones was the high rent of shops, but with a little creativity and a lot of work, she managed to find an interesting solution. She rented a property from the government for 25 years and had a modest, but sufficient, building built on it, which is perfectly suitable for the sewing workshop.   \n\nHer creativity, dedication and potential for continued growth qualifies her to participate in the WLIFT training program and to take an SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. She would like purchase additional, high quality embroidery machines which will enable her to provide a new set of services and deliver more competitive products. \n\nAs she explains with their own words: I\u2019m Shukria. I\u2019ve been a tailor for 20 years. I want to develop my business and improve my factory. With the help of Relief International, I will advance my business. I will purchase good quality embroidery machines to improve my services. Now I have three female workers with me, and, with God\u2019s will, the number of workers will increase to more than seven, as I have a big space and five sewing machines.\n\nShukria is a member of the industry union and constantly keeps an eye on the type of services in demand. The in-demand embroidery is one of these services she has learned about and would like to add to improve her business opportunities. \n\nShukria is 45 years old. She is a widow and a mother of 2 children whom she is supporting and raising alone \u2013 showing a great example to all children in the neighborhood about what hard work can achieve.  She is well respected, and although she did not receive a formal education, she has had a lifelong learning experience and has become a business woman with sustainable income.   \n\nShe would like to continue to grow, increase her income and continue to be a respected valuable member of her community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1501075,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2913,"youtubeId":"CRrPBkG4HbY","title":"Kiva Borrower Shukria from Iraq","thumbnailImageId":1501073},"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase embroidery machines and hire more women to work in the workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2014-01-02T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T18:30:07Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":148,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shukria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":291},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":277}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T12:35:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653085,"name":"Safia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Safia is 51 years old married woman and mother of three children.  \r\n\r\nThe man shown in the photo is Safia\u2019s son who is a driver by profession and provides transportation services using his three-wheeled rickshaw.

Now they are experiencing a tough time due to their poverty. \r\n\r\nMarjina has taken the initiative to help her husband financially. She heard that BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) offers loans to women in their community, so she applied for a loan of 15,000 INR to purchase potato seeds and fertilizers for growing potatoes in her own land along with the other vegetables. She has given preference to this business as potato cultivation is a very profitable job in her area. Potatoes have great demand in her area and they are used in most Indian dishes, so that\u2019s why Marjina hopes she can extend her business with the profit from her business. In future she will be able to build a concrete house also, as they are too uncomfortable in their kaccha house which is made of mud and straw."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1504721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase potato seeds and fertilizers for growing potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-01-02T18:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T18:30:08Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marjina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T02:36:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641267,"name":"Hawa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hawa is 25 years old and lives in West Point in Montserrado County, which has the largest Free port and is the number one commercial county in Liberia.

She has a 6th grade education and a degree as a beautician. Two of her sons are high school graduates, one with a specialization in Administration and the other in Hotel and Tourism. Her youngest son is in 9th grade. She knows the value of education for herself and for her children.\n\nAlva has owned a combination general store and beauty shop in San Juan del Obispo near Antigua, Guatemala for three years. Alva is seeking a loan of GTQ30,000 for expansion and growth. She has observed that many local residents take time-consuming trips to Antigua to buy things that she could be profitably selling there in San Juan. Her dream is to create a small supermarket in her building as there isn\u2019t one locally. \n\nHer first steps will be to use the beauty shop area and some spare rooms in her attached home, to accommodate new product lines such as bookstore items, paper products and metal goods. She will also expand her offerings of food and household items. She will begin accepting debit cards, hire an additional worker and blanket the community with flyers and posters. It is the size and scope of what she is trying to do that make her an exceptional candidate for the advanced training and larger loan of the Namaste Starz program.\n\nIn working with Fundaci\u00f3n Namaste Guatemaya (FNG), Alva recently completed its nine-month Basic Business Development program and increased her monthly profits by 33% to GTQ9,000. Alva is highly motivated as shown by the fact that she works 70-hour weeks to achieve her goals! Now by working with FNG\u2019s STARZ program she is aiming for monthly profits of GTQ11,824 by the end of 2014.\n\nThe STARZ program is unique in the world of microfinance as the loan repayments are tied to the profits of the borrower instead of being fixed payments. Since loan payments are linked to profits she can ride out business cycles or other unforeseen events.\n\nThrough the STARZ program high potential women receive intensive business coaching bi-weekly over two to three years. They also receive a formal six-month education in financial literacy and business operations that leads to a diploma in Small and Medium Enterprise Management by the Guatemalan Technical Institute for Training and Productivity (INTECAP). Credit is not generally available to women with businesses of this size, so an important program element is a right-sized business loan. \n\nThe women also receive coaching in leadership, economic and gender empowerment, and renegotiating household power relationships. By working with Fundaci\u00f3n Namaste Guatemaya, the STARZ participant and her business advisor have a continuous-loop, real-time monitoring, evaluation and learning system.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1484612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for a new bookstore and paper products lines in her store.
