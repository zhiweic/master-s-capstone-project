So Jerrynson and his family will properly prepare their food and at the same time will have better security and wellbeing, so Jerrynson can continue working and struggling to achieve his dream of studying for a professional career. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":235.31,"image":{"id":1346434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to buy a stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-08T23:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-07T23:40:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerrynson Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70.38},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.65,"local_amount":70.38,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":73.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664477,"comment":null},{"amount":31.4,"local_amount":79.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":83.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775979,"comment":null},{"amount":32.36,"local_amount":82.39,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779194,"comment":null},{"amount":33.72,"local_amount":85.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":89.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054375,"comment":null},{"amount":35.34,"local_amount":89.94,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":93.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819284,"comment":null},{"amount":36.6,"local_amount":93.17,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472246,"comment":null},{"amount":38.24,"local_amount":97.35,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":101.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694747,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-09T00:48:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":556807,"name":"Pedro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pedro es un hombre de 30 a\u00f1os, es soltero, vive en la ciudad de Pisco, el es una persona muy amable, trabajador y entusiasta, que tiene un gran deseo de superaci\u00f3n;

In addition to offering spa treatments, facials, pedicures, manicures, hair styling and natural beauty products, Lakita\u2019s business \u2013 \"Sole Harmony\" \u2013 hopes to help people find their inner beauty. \u201cSole Harmony\" deals with every core: mental, emotional, as well as physical beauty and well-being,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we're going to do workshops to deal with those issues as well. This is a new concept. It's not been done here. We are taking an inside-out approach to beauty and well-being.\u201d\r\n\r\nLakita said she got the idea for her business from listening to her clients over the course of her 30 years of work as a licensed hair stylist. \u201cYou realize that people cover themselves up with cosmetics and make their hair pretty and drive fancy cars and buy these big houses, but there\u2019s a void. There\u2019s something missing,\u201d Lakita says. \u201cSo how do you service those needs? That\u2019s where this was derived from \u2013 serving a deeper need.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo jump-start her business, Lakita received a loan from the Little Rock extension of ACCION Texas. She is using her working capital loan to build a website, from which she will host webinars on wellness topics. Additionally, she is buying inventory for the retail part of her business. She intends to sell all natural beauty products in her business.\r\n\r\nLakita said she learned about ACCION through her aunt, a business owner who advised her to go right to ACCION. \u201cI was looking for someone who helped start-up businesses, people who didn\u2019t have credit but needed start-up funding, and she told me to go to ACCION,\u201d she says. Without ACCION\u2019s help, Lakita says she would have been delayed in the start of her business. \u201cI would have continued working my full-time job until I could save the money,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s giving me a sense of security, knowing this money is helping me start and expand my business.\u201d\r\n\r\nOnce she launches her business, Lakita plans to contract with five beauty and wellness consultants. \u201cI\u2019m excited and nervous at the same time,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe this is a service that is needed. I believe there is a market for this.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1388.6,"image":{"id":1338896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

The experience left her in a coma, and although she eventually recovered, she still suffers from permanent amnesia.  \n\nDespite her trauma, she has become a successful businesswoman whose work has touched people around the world, via online programming, public speaking and publishing.\n\nShe created Indian Creek Management LLC, under which she operates Darkness To Light Films, a movie and TV production company. She also is a professional speaker who shares her inspiring story at schools, universities, correctional facilities, law enforcement conferences and other venues. \n\nShe currently produces an online talk show, \"Living True and Truly Living: Real People ...

In her free time she likes to play sports and sometimes she cooks the tasty \u201caji de gallina\u201d (a traditional Peruvian chicken stew) to share with her family.\n\nOn her own initiative, with a lot of effort and dedication, Gloria works in her own small business selling chicharrones, which are a food made from pork, potatoes, corn, and chili peppers. She works every day for approximately 10 hours and thinks it is going well because of her good seasonings and the friendly service she offers her clients.\n\nGloria is very grateful to Kiva lenders,

He is 50 years old and has been in a common-law relationship with Sra. Susana for many years.  They have a family that includes four children, all of whom are studying.  \r\n\r\nDon Bruno has a taxi that he offers as public transportation.  He started this business 10 years ago because he did not have a steady job.  There were many occasions in which his income was unpredictable, so he decided to provide public transportation services so that he could live without any financial worries.  Don Bruno says, \u201cWhen I started my business, it was very difficult because my first vehicle did not have license plates, so I always had to be careful to not get caught by the police.  They could confiscate my car since I had no papers to show them.\u201d   Nonetheless, his taxi was finally impounded and it took him three months to recover his vehicle.  He also had to pay a fine to the authorities.  \r\n\r\nThis situation led Don Bruno to form a group and seek support from a formal company.  The negotiations took four years before he finally received his concessions and license plates for his taxis.  Don Bruno currently has one taxi that he uses every day for his work, but he also has additional vehicles that he makes available for rent.  This time Sr. Bruno is requesting a loan so that he can buy tires and pay for the maintenance of his vehicle.  The loan will help him improve his services.

This nothing more than for the well-being of her children, especially on the subject of higher quality education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":584.79,"image":{"id":1346472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy raw materials, like soles, tags, and decorations in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-05-09T02:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-08T02:00:21Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115234},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149034},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152512},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156070},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159712},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163438},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167252},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171155},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175148},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179235},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183417},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227793}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.38,"local_amount":115234,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":116455.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705936,"comment":null},{"amount":81.97,"local_amount":149034,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":150613.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968225,"comment":null},{"amount":83.88,"local_amount":152512,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":154128.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817410,"comment":null},{"amount":85.84,"local_amount":156070,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":157724.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323681,"comment":null},{"amount":87.84,"local_amount":159712,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-20T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":161404.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082916,"comment":null},{"amount":89.89,"local_amount":163438,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":165170.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062278,"comment":null},{"amount":91.99,"local_amount":167252,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":169024.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731968,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T17:57:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":556825,"name":"Kathlyn","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kathlyn de 23 a\u00f1os de edad, es una confeccionista que habita en la ciudad de Cartagena de Indias, lugar donde tiene su peque\u00f1o taller de confecciones, el cual inici\u00f3 desde el a\u00f1o 2000, despu\u00e9s de aprender de su madre el oficio de preparar ensamblar y acabar ropa para damas.

In case of bandh in the state or a blockade on the two National Highways, the family income depreciates. To supplement the family income, she started a small Pan-Corner in the town market, which is located near the Town Bus stand.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of her business, she sold only paan and cigarettes as she didn't have sufficient capital to start a big business.  Her prudent quality shows because after a year, she could refill her paan corner with cosmetic products and used clothes. She says her shop location gives more advantages than the rest of the shop. She gets more customers from bus passengers who are departing and arriving in the town. She now enhanced the family income by triple and shares her husband's burden.\r\n \r\nWith the loan, she will buy more stock for the shop including summer used clothes like kurtees, medi-pants, T-shirts, shorts etc. Her aspiration is to buy a mini-van and use it for hiring purposes. Her husband earns by driving someone else's vehicle, which is tiring and high risk because if there is unfortunate accidental damage, the driver has to pay. She says after she joined the Phanem Group, she grew in different manners of life. She gained trust from other business partners and opened more doors for income-generating activities. Hatneineng and her husband also support her sister-in-law in pursuing her BSc Nursing degree. She will complete her course soon. Her accomplishments are uncountable says Hatneineng. She and her husband will work side-by-side to achieve what they dream of and will surely be successful.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in a ginger farm, a piggery, a garment-selling business etc. All the group members follow a group savings and a meeting is conducted on the second Sunday of every month. She says she is honored to be in the Phanem Group and thanked WSDS and Kiva for the support and love shown to the group. She considers it a personal blessing and prays to God for the growth of both WSDS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1346059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To refill her stocks with more cosmetic products and summer used clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-09T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-08T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneiting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemjavei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-12T06:28:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":556661,"name":"Assumpta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Assumpta, 40 years old, is a married woman and has been blessed with five kids.

Hoichong lives an exemplary life for other women folks in the village. Her right arm is paralyzed but she is capable of performing every household chore with only the help of her left arm. She also generates income for the family by weaving and raising pigs. She is the secretary of Jingvalpa Group and she is the featured borrower of the group. She is pictured with her hand raised. Hoichong still looks young and strong after raising eight children.\r\n \r\nHoichong weaves with the help of the loom, using only her one arm. She also raises pigs. She can weave all the different patterns and the latest designs. Her woven products are mostly traditional women's wrap around skirts and men's shawls, which are considered to be the most expensive ones. She sells her woven products in her village and nearby villages. Since her village is about 3 1\/2 kms away from the town market, she goes there only on market day, which is every Friday. On the other days, she raises pigs and finds feed for the pigs in the nearby fields. She says her pigs are all healthy and they are growing fast. She hopes to make a good sale when they are fully grown. She paid back her previous loan on time and managed to have a group savings with the other group members. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase two more piglets and more yarn for the weaving business.  She shares that facilities for physically different persons were applied for by her husband so that she could avail government schemes to promote herself in generating an income for the family. The required proceedings were followed but it took longer than expected. By that time, she had joined Jingvalpa Group and now she is able to make an income for the family, which makes her believe in herself more. She says her confidence grows more with the family and society too. The family burden is now shared financially by her. She thanks WSDS and Kiva for all the support and assistance provided to them. She says, \"Thank you so much\".\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in a piggery, a vegetable-selling business, a rice-selling business, and weaving.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1345123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase more yarn to weave and two more piglets to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-09T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-08T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoishi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongvei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chogneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimkhongah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneirose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neibem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-09T12:25:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":556668,"name":"Shehnaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms  Shehnaz is 42 years old and married.

Taking out this loan will offer Majed and his family comfortable furniture so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. \r\n\r\nIn order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (a portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. Just one year ago, she began providing taxi services to local people using her own automobile on work days. On the weekends, she and her husband make and sell jackets to vendors in various districts at wholesale prices. Last year they began building a house on their land because the Mongolian winter is very harsh, forcing them to burn lot of coal to heat the ger so they don't freeze. But due to lack of finances, they haven't finished their house completely and some necessary items are remaining. She is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT to purchase vacuum insulated windows, metal shakes used for roofing and cement. As you can see from the picture, her house needs roofing and windows. After using these materials, she and her husband can complete their house and provide warm and comfortable accommodation for their children. More importantly, this new high quality house won't lose its heat and will enable the family to reduce its coal consumption, thus contributing to efforts against air pollution by releasing less smoke to air.

Two of her children are attending school. \r\n\r\nNancy runs a local soap business; she sells soap. She has been running this business since 2009. She works at the business from 8:30am until 6:30pm, 6 days per week. Nancy says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of capital.\r\n\r\nNancy has requested a loan in order to buy more palm oil and soap powder to expand her soap business. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, she hopes to open a soap factory. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1344871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter; ingredients that she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJocelyn dreams of having another branch for her bakery.

Her husband is employed as a carpenter by a wooden products sales company. Her elder son studies at high school while her younger son is at kindergarten. \r\n\r\nDuring winter time the family are chilled to the core due to living in an old deteriorated Mongolian traditional 'ger'. So this year, they began building their own house but couldn't finish it due to lack of finances. So Otgonchimeg is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, bricks, cement and metal shakes. If she can complete her house, their children can live in a comfortable and warm place. The high quality house will enable the family to burn less coal, releasing less carbon dioxide and thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution. Living in a house is way better than living in a 'ger' in terms of both warmth and comfort. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who doesn't want her husband and sons to be chilled to the core in harsh wintertime.

Besides this, they have a 1.5 hectare plot of agricultural land.  It is hardly enough for food for the family.

Anzor has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

She is a humble, hard-working woman, and she had three loans with a communal bank named 'Mujeres emprendedoras de Chilamate' (meaning 'women entrepreneurs of Chilamate'). She had to leave the bank to care for her mother and, following her death, she was not able to join the bank again for administrative reasons. Vera sells food, mainly ceviche, at her house on week-ends, but her main activity is transportation services in her area, since there is no public transport there, the nearest bus station being one kilometre away. Many neighbours thus come to her for transportation. Her taxi was in an accident, and while she took the persons responsible to court, it is in need of repairs in the meantime. This is why she asks for a loan to repair it while waiting for the legal proceedings to come to an end. In view of her dire financial situation, Vera took another job to compensate for the loss of earnings from her transportation business. She is now a domestic worker in a house in Alajuela: three days a week, she leaves the house after preparing a meal for her husband, who works in the same city, and they take the bus together and come back in the afternoon. Vera then has to do housework in the evenings. She asks for this loan in order to be able to help support her family through her transportation business again. Her husband and her son, with whom she lives, are very supportive of her resuming her transportation activity. Vera's business is very small and she needs to complement it with other sources of income. Since her family is very poor, the income derived from her transportation business is essential to their survival. Repairs are therefore urgent.

is 23 years old. He lives in the small village of Khulo District with his parents and brother. Lasha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have calves and a plot of agricultural land, where potatoes are grown. They sell the harvested potatoes locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLasha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Lasha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.
