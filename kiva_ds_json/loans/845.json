successfully applied for, received, and repaid a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq, which she used to purchase a small generator allowing her to work even during the hours of the day the city's power was out.  She also bought some fabric and tools for her work.\r\n\r\nWith the previous loan she was able to make improvements benefiting her customers, and with a new loan Shler will concentrate more on making some improvements she can also benefit from.  She would like to renew her work area, making the conditions of her work more pleasant.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor, thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Debido a que la demanda del mercado es superior a la capacidad de producci\u00f3n de su taller, Martha busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina plana para generar un empleo en su taller y aumentar su capacidad de producci\u00f3n.\n\nMartha de esta manera podr\u00e1 tener un taller que responda a todos los pedidos de sus clientes y as\u00ed poder seguir creciendo en su taller de modo que pueda seguir generando empleo para las personas m\u00e1s necesitadas. Adem\u00e1s, Martha espera que su negocio le cumpla el sue\u00f1o de poder ofrecerle a su hijo una educaci\u00f3n de calidad y en un futuro brindarle educaci\u00f3n universitaria y una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica. \n","en":"Martha is the head of household and the single mother of a 6-year-old child whose father left without providing any financial support. So Martha has been working very hard in hopes of generating the income they need to meet their expenses. Martha has been a tailor for two years, a trade she learned from her family, and has built a great business making wallets. She sells them throughout the area and has acquired a large number of customers. As demand exceeds her production capacity, Martha is seeking a loan to enable her to buy another industrial sewing machine for her workshop so that she can add an employee and increase her production.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Martha would be able to fill all her customers' orders and continue expanding and generating employment for those who most need it. Martha also hopes that through her business she will achieve her dream to give her child a good education now, a university education in the future, and financial stability.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1059727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy another industrial sewing machine for her workshop so that she can add an employee and increase production.

sons. He works with repairing engines for cars. For this, he rents 45 square meters large premises in a central part of the city. Roman's workshop is famous among the car owners in the city. He always performs work of excellent quality, as well as after-sales service to customers. \r\n\r\nRoman has been working in this area for 18 years. Currently, his net profit is around 5 000 hryvnia. Roman plans to invest his loan of 12 000 hryvnia in a lathe (a machine tool), which is necessary for his work at the workshop. With the help of the lathe, Roman can independently carry out restoration of the chassis components of a vehicle. \r\n\r\nRoman has started working in his own garage. Gradually investing in the business, he was able to move to more spacious premises, to acquire a bus for the work, and further to move from a two-room flat to a three-room flat with his family, and to restore the new flat.

The members of this group are from Pinotepa Nacional, the land of progress and improvement.  One tradition of the population is the fiesta of Semana Santa (Holy Week) during which the games come so that children can entertain themselves.  \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Herminia Bernardita, a 42-year-old, hard-working, and happy woman.  Do\u00f1a Herminia, as she is better known by her friends in the group, makes a living selling tortilla chips, which she has done for five years.  What she likes most about her business is to take good care of her customers, and she tells us that she really enjoys preparing the dough and making the tortilla chips.  She says that she only makes pre-orders and on occasion sells them in her house, but she does not go out to sell in the streets of her community.  She also has been making a living selling jellies and flans for three years, but she stopped making them four months ago because she has not had the resources to prepare her jellies.  She is happily married to Se\u00f1or Mart\u00edn with whom she has two daughters who are already married; Lizeth and Adilene.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Herminia asked for the loan in order to buy more firewood and corn for making tortilla chips.  She tells us that she buys the firewood before the rainy season begins because during that time the firewood and the corn is very expensive.  She says that she is very happy with the Foundation for helping her to improve her life more each day and for giving her the opportunity to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nMaricela -  she makes a living selling cakes.\r\nLisset - she makes a living selling food.\r\nAdilene - she makes a living selling perfume.\r\nBlanca Estela - she makes a living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nWenceslada Carmela - she makes a living selling beef.\r\n\r\nThey give thanks to the Foundation for helping them to improve their lives and to make more profit and thus grow their

Its temperature is generally around 25.5\u00b0 C (77.9\u00b0 F), sometimes reaching 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0 F). The whole province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas is set in the mountain area of the coast, in the western range, also known as Provincia de Yumbos y Capital de los Colibr\u00edes (Yumbo Province and Capital of the Hummingbirds), and it is located in the humid tropic of Latin America. It is considered a new province, having been created in 2007.\r\n\r\nSandra wants to invest the loan in the purchase of 8 piglets and in animal feed. She will breed the piglets in her farm to then sell them and thus gain a better income, in order to offer a better standard of living to her son. This is her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, the institution through which Sandra connects to the Kiva community. During her first loan, she has stood out for being punctual with her repayments. She is very optimistic, and we wish her all the best with this investment, so that she will come closer to making her dream come true: to have a house of her own in order to grant a better future to her son.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1078315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

aprendi\u00f3 la actividad de la carpinter\u00eda hace aproximadamente 30 a\u00f1os, pues sus hermanos mayores se dedicaban a esta actividad y se la ense\u00f1aron desde muy temprana edad. Gracias a esto, aprendi\u00f3 a hacer productos de muy buena calidad en las carpinter\u00edas de su hermano, y posteriormente decidi\u00f3 montar su propia carpinter\u00eda aprovechando la experiencia que ten\u00eda en fabricar productos de muy buena calidad. El negocio que mont\u00f3 quebr\u00f3 al poco tiempo debido a los fuertes problemas de violencia que hab\u00edan en su municipio, y por esto se vio obligado a trabajar en diferentes carpinter\u00edas como empleado y gan\u00e1ndose salarios muy bajos. Hace aproximadamente 2 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 volver a abrir su propia carpinter\u00eda para probar de nuevo suerte y poder trabajar para su propia cuenta y gan\u00e1ndose un salario m\u00e1s alto que trabajando como empleado. Actualmente, Rogelio se encuentra casado y tiene 5 hijos y su carpinter\u00eda sigue creciendo gracias a la buena calidad de los productos que all\u00ed fabrica. Adem\u00e1s, su familia ha podido tener una mejor calidad de vida gracias al aumento en los ingresos de Rogelio. Con el \u00e1nimo de entregar pedidos que le han hecho sus clientes, Rogelio busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de madera para la fabricaci\u00f3n de sus productos.\n\nDe esta manera podr\u00e1 seguir entregando los pedidos que le hacen sus clientes y seguir teniendo un buen trabajo con un buen salario. Adem\u00e1s, si su taller sigue creciendo espera que con mayores ingresos su familia pueda gozar de una mejor calidad de vida y sus 5 hijos tengan acceso a una educaci\u00f3n de mejor calidad. \n","en":"Rogelio learned carpentry approximately 30 years ago because his older brothers did this work and taught it to him at a very young age.  Thanks to this he learned to make very good-quality products in his brother's workshop.  Later he decided to set up his own shop, making the most of the experience he had in making good-quality products.  The business he started went bankrupt very quickly because of severe problems with violence in the town, so he had to work in different carpentry workshops as an employee, and earning very low salaries.\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago he decided once again to open his own shop, to try his luck again and be able to work on his own and earn a higher salary than working as an employee.  Currently Rogelio is married and has five children, and his shop continues to grow thanks to the good quality of products he makes there.

She is separated from the father of her son; he provides them with no financial support. Seeing the need to earn an income, Luz Fanny decided to open a store where she sells basic items like candy, soft drinks, snacks etc. She's had the store for about six years and has used the income to support her son and provide him with an education. When she started the store she didn't have much capital so couldn't buy a refrigerator. Now she is seeking a loan to buy one so she can offer her customers items that need to be kept cold such as cold cuts, cheese etc.\r\n\r\nWith this purchase Luz Fanny hopes that her business will continue to thrive and provide her with a good income so that she doesn't have to worry about money. As well she hopes that her son will have a good standard of living and access to a good education. Her dream is to have a big store and provide employment for those who most need it, and to have a stable, regular

She is in a common-law relationship with Michel, who is a merchant and the father of their three-year-old son Mois\u00e9s.  Jessenia lives comfortably with her partner and child in their own home which they purchased through much effort.  Her business involves preparing and selling sweets such as cakes and cupcakes.  She learned how to prepare these treats from her mother.  Jessenia makes delicious cupcakes, donuts, sweet rolls, and other items to sell from her home and as a traveling merchant.  She utilized a personal loan and her partner's savings to begin preparing and selling sweets.  Her business has been in existence for more than seven years.  In addition, Jessenia sells fruits, but the constant rains have halted her momentarily, so she will resume this activity later.  She is grateful that her business allows her to earn an income for supporting her children and that she has a career since she did not have the opportunity to finish her studies.  Now she wants to invest her capital and open a small grocery store in her home.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her second loan with the MFP organization.  She is grateful to have the opportunity to access a line of credit for accomplishing her goals.  In addition, Jessenia says that she feels comfortable with her Communal Bank because she knows most of the members and considers them to be responsible and supportive people.  With the loan of 1,500 PEN that she requested, Jessenia will invest in the purchase of ingredients for preparing sweets such as sugar, oil, flour, starch, butter, and other items in bulk so that she will have better profit margins.

She is a single mother and the head of her household of two children, who are 15 and 17, because of her husband's death seven years ago.  Lucely has had to work hard every day in order to ensure that her children have what they need to get ahead and keep making progress in their lives.  Because she had to generate income for her household, Lucely started out by opening a business selling cell phones, which did not go very well for her.  After a few months she had to close it.  Next, she opened a business selling shoes, which she currently works at and which is still growing, thanks to the effort Lucely puts in every day.

Su tienda no tiene ningun nombre ya que tiene poco tiempo escasamente dos a\u00f1os, el reto mas grande que tiene que atravesar do\u00f1a Pilar es la falta de recursos para adquirir mas producto ya que tiene mucha competencia y si no tiene bien surtida la tienda es muy dificil que le lleguen los clientes a su negocio.\nNos comenta que la tienda la inicio ya que su pareja muchas veces se queda sin trabajo y de algun modo tenian que empezar un negocio donde les dejara recursos economicos para mejorar su calidad de vida y lo que mas le gusta de su negocio es darle un buen trato a los clientes.\nLa meta que tiene Pilar es que su tienda pueda estenderse y llegar a ser un minisuper todo esto lo hace para poder mejorar su calidad de vida de ella y su familia, la se\u00f1ora Pilar y el resto del grupo estan muy agradecidao ya que podran invertir en sus actividades, Teresa comprara pollitos y borregos, Luisa comprara borregos, Anita comprara Maiz para animales, Rosaura comprara guajolotes, Dionicia y Elodia comprara pollos y guajolotes.","en":"The group \"Barrio El Riito\" consists of seven hardworking and responsible women who are working together as a group with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the first time.  They chose the name for their group because they live near a small river that provides crystal-clear drinking water for the community.  On this occasion, the members elected Do\u00f1a Pilar to be the group representative.  She is currently 27 years of age and has been in a common-law relationship for two years with her partner Alvaro.  They have a son who does not attend school even though he enjoys learning.  However, they lack the funds to send him to school.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Pilar has a grocery store, so she is requesting a loan to restock her business with products she is lacking such as canned goods, milk, bread, eggs, detergents, and other items.  Her store does not have a name, but it has been in existence for barely two years.  The greatest challenge she faces is not having the resources to acquire more products.  There is plenty of competition, so if her store does not have enough stock, it is very difficult for her business to attract customers.  Pilar says she started her store because her partner lost his job some time ago.  Somehow she found the means to start a business so that she could generate income to improve her quality of life.  What she enjoys most about her business is being able to provide good service to her customers.  Pilar's goal is to expand her store and turn it into a mini-supermarket with the intention of improving her quality of life and that of her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Pilar and the rest of her group are extremely grateful that they can invest in their businesses:\r\n\u2022\tTeresa will buy baby chickens and lambs.\r\n\u2022\tLuisa will buy lambs.\r\n\u2022\tAnita will buy corn for her animals.\r\n\u2022\tRosaura will buy turkeys.\r\n\u2022\tDionicia and Elodia will buy chickens and turkeys.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":1078274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy canned goods, milk, bread, eggs, and other products.

She is 19 years old and started her own business 4 years ago: she sells clothes, mainly to classmates, family members, friends and neighbours. Thanks to this, Lennis has been paying for her studies and contributing to household expenses, so as to give her parents and siblings a better quality of life. Thanks to the good customer service she provides and to the quality of her products, she has many customers, and thus makes a nice profit every month.
