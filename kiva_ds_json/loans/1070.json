Since childhood she helped her mother with the household and loved doing household chores. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing school she got a job at a local collective farm as a laboratory assistant for dairy products. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of collective farms, Tursun and her husband started working with livestock breeding. They started this business with 5,000 som (KGS). Currently Tursun has two cows on her farm. \r\n\r\nTo further increase the number of livestock, Tursun turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of a dairy cow. This will increase the income from the sale of dairy products. With the income, she plans to further expand her

","en":"Mehriniso is a very hard working and purposeful woman. She was born in a rural area and has sufficient experience with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. After school she worked in the field, in order to earn money and help her parents. \r\n\r\nMehriniso especially grows wheat, sweet corn and other agricultural products. She has run this business independently for more than 6 months. She sells the harvest directly to the local residents at a lower price than at the market. With an aim to increase her skills, Mehriniso took part in the training \"Woman Entrepreneur, Get Ahead\", held by the Association of Business Women and \"IMON International\", in partnership with the International Labor Organization. \r\n\r\nThis year, due to unfavorable weather, Mehriniso was not able to get a normal harvest. Therefore she contacted our organization for a loan for the purchase of livestock, as she would like to set up a new business of livestock breeding.

She is married and has three children. She works at a medical center. The salary she receives is not even enough for living expenses. Her husband is in the Russian Federation, and he sends her money.

Fredy, who is 28 years old, and together they have one three-year-old son. She lives together with her small family in a brick house which they rent. With the arrival of her little one, she decided to drop the work she was doing at the time, which consisted of the laborious and near constant work of selling clothing, in order to look after their child. Thus their primary source of income was Fredy, who works as a bus driver on provincial routes. As a way of reentering the workforce she hopes to open up a business selling cellular phones, accessories, and calling cards. She believes this is a good business opportunity because there are not many businesses of this type in her town. Her long term goal is to purchase her own vehicle so that both she and Fredy may contribute to household finances. This is her first loan cycle with MFP, and she promises to make punctual payments on her loan as a way of demonstrating her complete gratitude. In this cycle she is seeking 500 nuevos soles to supplement her own money in order to purchase cell phone accessories such as chargers, headsets, and other products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1305573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase telephone accessories.

Makassar is one of the largest cities in Indonesia and has all the problems third world cities have: including a lack of access to safe and affordable drinking.  That is why Sunaani started to sell Nazava Water Filters.  So far she has been very successful: Three times she ordered water filtersand each time all her filters were sold out within a day. \nBecause Sulawesi is an island, the filters need to be shipped with an unreliable and slow boat service which needs almost two weeks to get the Nazava Water Filters to mrs Sunaani. That is why she is in urgent need of more stock. Besides, the shipping costs would be reduce by almost 50 % when she orders a few more boxes. \u201cMany many people here want a filter, but I do not have money to increase my stock\u201d, as Sunaani told to Nazava\u2019s sales manager. \nWith a Kiva loan, Mrs Sunaani can make safe and affordable drinking water available to 1000 people in just 1 month. The loan allows her to buy around 200 water filters for a bigger discount and with lower transportation costs. By supporting Mrs. Sunaani, it\u2019s not only her business that will be boosted but more families will have access to safe and affordable drinking water and these families will also save money and increase their disposable income. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1305550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a larger stock of water filters and increase the access to safe and affordable drinking water in her region.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Makassar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2013-03-05T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-04T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sunaani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1074.55,"local_amount":1074.55,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1074.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373537267,"comment":null},{"amount":925.45,"local_amount":925.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-30T08:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":925.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381768363,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-05T06:50:26Z","paid_date":"2013-07-30T08:49:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533605,"name":"Abamwe Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet is a married woman aged 46.

The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salary of Tsiala\u2019s son, who works as an economist at a private company. Their monthly income is not enough to feed five members of the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTsiala has asked for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are seen as \u201chigh risk borrowers.\u201d With the received credit, Tsiala will trade in clothes and bedding. She plans to buy at wholesale prices and then resell at a higher price in her newly opened shop.

He is married, and lives with his wife and daughter in the Kvareli District. \r\n\r\nTeimuraz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for the family business start-up, without success. His loan request was rejected every time, due to low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard and 1.5 hectare of agricultural land, where maize is grown.  \r\n\r\nTeimuraz is very hard working man. He cultivates the land seasonally before sowing, but the income is too small; it is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Teimuraz will purchase calves, raise them and resell them at a higher price. This will increase the income of the family. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1220,"image":{"id":1304439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves, then raise and sell them for a higher price.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Teklati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-05T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-04T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teimuraz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":305},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":457.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":457.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":305}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":305,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":504.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107225,"comment":null},{"amount":457.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":756.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254796,"comment":null},{"amount":457.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":756.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440018965,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T21:32:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533622,"name":"Chinyavu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chinyavu is a 35-year-old person from Samburu, Kenya.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"When I was eight years old my father thought it was time to learn to weave on a floor loom, just like he did. My products are associated with the history of Guatemala; for example, our ancestors used to place the tortillas in a square holder woven by the women on a backstrap loom. Now, that same tortilla holder is used as a placemat or napkin. I have taught the art of weaving to more than 80 people and now I dedicate most of my time to designing new colors with natural dyes, innovating weaving techniques and supervising apprentices.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really appreciated your assistance with the first micro-credit, which helped me buy the materials to develop a number of new designs. We were able to pay it off completely and on time. Now, I'm requesting a second loan to buy weaving materials for the handbags we are creating.

It has been a profitable project and the only source of income for him, but also it needs more support to cover the costs.\r\n\r\nMohammad is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing needed stock of basic groceries that customers often request, such as rice, sugar, milk and canned food. This will increase sales and increase Mohammad's income. Mohammad is looking in the future to expand his project to improve his income.\r\n\r\nThe photo of Mohammad is in his grocery store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees.

The start-up loan program is intended to lend capital with soft conditions to the rural poor, so they can start up businesses. They would not otherwise have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nDavid plans to buy the rights to work on the mini-bus line with the loan, which means that he will not have to pay rent as he is currently doing. He will own the line, and won\u2019t have to share the income with anybody. David should therefore get a higher income than before, and this will significantly improve the living conditions of his family.  David dreams of being able to provide a better life for his children.

Because she has been doing this work for some time, Hermelinda has acquired good customers, which helps her have greater sales and give her daughters a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe'll invest this loan in buying nail polish, eyeliner, lipstick, eye shadow, deodorant, and perfume.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are for her daughters because she would like them to have the opportunity to study for a profession.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Lourdes, chicken sales;

Ana is requesting a loan from VisionFund to stock a little bit more of everything that she sells like eggs, milk, toilet paper, oil for cooking, diapers, sugar, salt, eggs, tuna, napkins, soft drinks, cookies and some candy in order to sell a little bit of everything.  She says that on Saturdays she goes to a store in her town where they sell wholesale and give her low prices.  She says that later on she wants to sell cold cuts and put in different dairy products.  She says that upon finishing her high school studies she wants to go into studying to be an educator because it would be one of her greatest achievements.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Alma Isabel, Gabriela, Marisela, Fabiola, Mar\u00eda Isabel, Irma, Adelina y Jarintzi.  They will invest in the purchase of bedspreads to sell, in the purchase of supplies to make bread, to stock a grocery store, to buy chicken to sell by the kilo, to buy cosmetics and perfumes to sell and to stock shoes for women and men to sell.

For the past five years, Beatrice has been working hard to manage the small hotel that she owns. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Beatrice has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy material to put in her small hotel, which will help Beatrice to generate greater profits and lead to increased returns and expansion of the hotel. Beatrice hopes that in the future she will be able to add more money to the business. \r\n\r\nBeatrice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past 11 months, Norah has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells maize, rice and coffee. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Norah has requested a loan of 600000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to look after the family and add more commodities in the shop to be sold to her clients at a good price. This will help Norah to generate greater profits and enlarge the business. Norah hopes that in the future she will be able to add to the business. \r\n\r\nNorah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past 3 years, Gerina has been working hard to manage her fruit business, which sells passion fruits. \n\nTo help expand her business, Gerina has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a fridge and will help Gerina to generate greater profits and increase the income level of the family. Gerina hopes that in the future she will be able to start another  business. \n\nGerina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

is 50 years old and lives in Pakwach, Uganda. He is married and has 6 children; with 5 of them currently in school. For the past 6 years, Anthony has been working hard to manage his stall, which sells flour. \n\nTo help expand his business, Anthony has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to improve on the business and buy more produce such as maize flour to sell. It will also help Anthony generate greater profits and help generate income. Anthony hopes that in the future he will be able to expand the business. \n\nAnthony is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

She is married to Juan Carlos and they have two young daughters, who are their reason for living.  Isabel is the owner of a dwelling built from adobe blocks where her family shares daily experiences. From a very young age her life has been tied to farming and, together with her family, she produces organic cacao. Since she became an adult she has had the responsibility of keeping her parcel of land under cultivation and of doing plantation maintenance where it is necessary to perform the tasks of weeding and pruning the trees in order to obtain quality cacao crops.

el mes de febrero hay un carnaval donde toda la gente se divierte al m\u00e1ximo algunas de ellas participan en dicho Carnaval. El nombre del grupo lo eligi\u00f3 Don Mateo porque una de sus hijas se llama Mar\u00eda Isabel y de cari\u00f1o le dicen Chabelita. Son personas muy trabajadoras pero sobretodo muy alegres.\n\nMar\u00eda Isabel, hija de Don Mateo tambi\u00e9n pertenece al grupo, platica que tiene 29 a\u00f1os en la actualidad vive en uni\u00f3n libre con el se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 Alejandro juntos han formado una familia con tres ni\u00f1os de los cuales van a la escuela. Isabel est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para comprar ropa nueva como pantal\u00f3n, su\u00e9teres, camisas, ropa para bebe, ropa para ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as etc. Isabel lleva ya tres a\u00f1os con la actividad la inicio porque quer\u00eda ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar. Isabel argumento \u201cMis ni\u00f1os eran muy peque\u00f1os y yo no pod\u00eda conseguir un empleo ya que no pod\u00eda dejar tanto tiempo a mis ni\u00f1os solos, as\u00ed que para m\u00ed fue m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil iniciar a vender ropa\u201d Isabel platica que solo inicio con $500 pesos ahora est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar m\u00e1s ropa la cual la compra en Toluca, para despu\u00e9s venderlas en las comunidades cercanas caminando, considera una muy buena manera de vender porque si puede tener m\u00e1s clientes, porque si solo se estableciera en un mismo lugar no tendr\u00eda las mismas ganancias como las que est\u00e1 teniendo actualmente. Isabel cuenta que su \u00fanica dificultad es cuando sus clientas se tardan mucho tiempo en pagarle y es cuando no salen muy bien sus ganancias pero de ah\u00ed en fuera nada grave, esto no la limita a tener grandes sue\u00f1os como el que sus hijos terminen una carrera profesional donde puedan realizarse y tener una mejor calidad de vida, tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda mejorar su vivienda para sentirse mas c\u00f3modos. Isabel y los integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy contentos y agradecidos con VisionFund y KIVA por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado porque al igual que Isabel ellos tambi\u00e9n podr\u00e1n invertir en sus actividades como Don Mateo invertir\u00e1 en su vulcanizadora, Ana Lilia invertir\u00e1 en ropa y finalmente Sebasti\u00e1n en material para construcci\u00f3n.\n","en":"The \u201cLas Chabelitas\u201d group is located in a calm community with very friendly people. They say that in the month of February, there is a carnival in which everyone has a lot of fun. Some of them participate in this carnival. Mateo chose the name of the group, because one of his daughters is named Mar\u00eda Isabel and they affectionately call her Chabelita. The members are very hardworking people, but above all they are very happy.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel, Mateo's daughter, also belongs to the group. She is 28 years old and lives in a common law marriage with Jos\u00e9 Alejandro. Together they have started a family with their three children, who go to school. Isabel has applied for this loan to buy new clothing, such as pants, sweaters, shirts, clothing for babies and children, etc. She has already been in this business for three years, because she wanted to help her husband with their household expenses. Isabel says, \"My children were very young and I was unable to work because I couldn't leave them alone for a long time, so it was easier for me to start selling clothing.\" Isabel says that she started her business with only 500 pesos.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for this loan to buy more clothing in Toluca, which she will then sell by walking around the surrounding communities. She considers this a very good way to make sales because she can have more clients. If she only established herself in one place, she would not have the same income that she currently has. Isabel says that her only difficulty arises when her clients take a long time to pay her, and when her income is not very good. However, this has not been serious and it has not kept her from having big dreams, such as her children finishing a professional degree so that they can fulfill themselves and have a better quality of life. She would also like to make improvements to her home so that the family is more comfortable.\r\n\r\nIsabel and the group members are very happy and grateful to VisionFund and Kiva for this loan. Like Isabel, they will be able to invest in their businesses.

Neliberta, 48, is a very smiling person. She has been married to Alejandro for 29 years. Together they have made a family with their four children, who are studying. \r\n\r\nNeliberta has been raising oxen and pigs for two years. She started this business because she wanted to help her husband with their home expenses and their children's school expenses. She had also noticed, since she was a young girl, that the majority of people in her community had animals to sell. Neliberta has applied for another loan from this institution to buy more feed for the pigs and calves which she has at home. She says that she has not sold any of her animals, which is why she still has not earned an income, because she would like to raise many animals in order to sell them when she really needs the money.\r\n\r\nShe is very pleased because thanks to her previous loan, the number of pigs and oxen she owns has increased little by little.

is Marylen, 37, She is a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Ernesto, a construction worker, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarylen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 15,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMarylen hopes to give her children a good life and a future and dreams for an expansion in her business.

Her long-term plans are to build her home with good-quality materials, which she hopes will improve her quality of life and that of her young son.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1306294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-05T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-04T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":106.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117.03},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":120.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":129.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":140.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.54,"local_amount":106.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":110.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869043,"comment":null},{"amount":46.81,"local_amount":117.03,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":121.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577884,"comment":null},{"amount":48.35,"local_amount":120.88,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":125.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530115,"comment":null},{"amount":99.26,"local_amount":248.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":257.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975146,"comment":null},{"amount":51.84,"local_amount":129.6,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":134.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996413,"comment":null},{"amount":111.2,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":288.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352322,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-06T03:00:33Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534577,"name":"Maira Marisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maira, est\u00e1 solicitando un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo, para continuar invirtiendo aun mas en el negocio, se comprara ma\u00edz, sal, aceite, le\u00f1a, quesillo, repollo, gaseosas y otros productos que sean necesarios para que el negocio pueda seguir brindando un buen servicio.\nElla comenta que el pr\u00e9stamo anterior le permiti\u00f3 mejorar su condici\u00f3n, crecer y tener los materiales necesarios para trabajar, en su familia considera que su situaci\u00f3n ha mejorado teniendo m\u00e1s ingresos. \n","en":"Maira is seeking a new loan so that she can continue to invest in her business.

They chose this name because they meet in Lucia's house, and she has a corn mill, which is why they thought of naming their group this way.\r\n\r\nLucy, as she is affectionately called, is 42 and has been married to Margarito for 22 years. Together they formed a family with five children. Only one of their daughters is still studying and therefore dependent on them; the other four children are already independent. Lucy is a very enthusiastic and happy woman, but above all she is very hardworking. \r\n\r\nShe has made a living raising pigs, oxen, chickens, turkeys, and ducks for 22 years, since she married Margarito. Lucy says that she started this business because she wanted to help her husband with their household costs. She became even more motivated when the institution offered her a loan, which they said was to invest in her animals. Now she is applying for a loan to buy more pigs and calves. \r\n\r\nShe says that she doesn't have any difficulties in her work, because she already has plenty of experience with the animals. She has received two training sessions about raising animals, one from the institution and one from the government. Lucy said: \"I like my work very much because I can see how the mothers give birth to their baby animals. Once we had a sheep who gave us twins, but she wasn't able to give birth to them and we had to help her with the techniques we learned in the training.\" \r\n\r\nLucy is very happy and grateful to VisionFund because thanks to the loans, she has been able to invest in her animals. With her earnings, she has been able to finish building her house. Her house only had two rooms, but now it has four rooms and a small living room.
