From a very young age he has worked as an ironsmith, a trade he learned from his parents.  He also works as a crop farmer growing corn, beans and sorghum for family consumption.  Over the years he worked as a mason's assistant and learned the trade 25 years ago.  This is the work he does to earn an income to support the family.  His children help with the agriculture and thanks to their help they have been able to build a house little by little, although it is not yet finished.  His wife makes artisan bread and raises chickens and pigs at home.\r\n\r\nJuan is requesting a loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy sand, cement and iron to build a small room, and pay for transport of materials.  He already has the blocks he needs.  With the investment his family will live more comfortably, since there are several members of the family and they are quite cramped.  He wants to put in flooring since the house now has a dirt floor.  He also wants to give his children an education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":729.37,"image":{"id":1314323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy sand, cement and iron to build a small room, and to pay for materials transport.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-03-18T13:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-17T13:20:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":72.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":74.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":76.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":79.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":85.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":97.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.47},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.17,"local_amount":77.17,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":77.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525438,"comment":null},{"amount":70.87,"local_amount":70.87,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":70.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133675,"comment":null},{"amount":81.71,"local_amount":81.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":81.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381938741,"comment":null},{"amount":168.7,"local_amount":168.7,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":168.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814820,"comment":null},{"amount":84.63,"local_amount":84.63,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":84.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090657,"comment":null},{"amount":92.87,"local_amount":92.87,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":92.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856656,"comment":null},{"amount":153.42,"local_amount":153.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":153.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716015,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-19T23:23:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":538870,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad, a 38-year-old married father of two girls and one boy, works in a governmental institution during the day; afterwards he works in his own business making dairy products, as he has a small number of goats and sheep.

She was born into a very humble family and, as a result, has always worked hard farming corn and beans.  Her parents also taught her how to weave 'petates' (bedrolls) and raise pigs.\r\n\r\nEladia's parents died and she got married at the age of 18.  She has one daughter from her marriage who is now an adult.  These days Eladia only lives with her husband.  She is always hard at work weaving 'petates', fattening pigs and doing farm work.  In addition, she also sells lotions, lingerie, creams and other types of beauty products.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy the palm fibers she needs for weaving her petates, Eladia has to walk along mountain paths because there is no public transport service where she lives.  She buys her beauty products, to order, from the main city in her region.  This involves a twenty minute bus journey.\r\n\r\nEladia is requesting this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy wood, tiles and canes so that she can improve her home as the existing wood is in a bad state of repair.  She will also pay the rent on the plot of land she cultivates.  Eladia has experienced difficulties for the past two winters as her house has become damp owing to the bad state of the wood and she doesn't want to experience these difficulties any more.

Se cas\u00f3 muy joven y se dedic\u00f3 a los quehaceres del hogar y fue muy triste para ella no poder tener hijos. \u00c9ste y otros motivos fueron la causa de su divorcio que fue una etapa muy dif\u00edcil de sobrellevar. Sin embargo esta mujer ejemplar ha salido adelante y ahora vive en el Cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. \nEsther desde hace 6 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos y art\u00edculos para el hogar. La mayor\u00eda de sus clientes son mujeres. Con las ventas ella gana premios de art\u00edculos que le sirven para uso personal. Dedica varias horas cada d\u00eda en la ma\u00f1ana y en la tarde recorriendo las largas calles de su ciudad para tomar los pedidos de sus clientes, ofrecer los productos y realizar cobranzas de sus ventas anteriores. Ahora requiere un cr\u00e9dito que lo utilizar\u00e1 en compra de mercader\u00eda al por mayor y de esta forma podr\u00e1 obtener mayor descuento y as\u00ed ofrecer precios competitivos a sus clientes. Con los ingresos extras que se generen, Esther pagar\u00e1 algunas deudas y adem\u00e1s realizar\u00e1 arreglos que su casa necesita tanto en la fachada como en las instalaciones del interior. Gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva le ayudar\u00e1n a financiar este sue\u00f1o, ella se siente tranquila, pues adem\u00e1s de recibir un buen trato, su ejecutivo le ha asesorado y le ha brindado agilidad y confianza con el tr\u00e1mite. Esther dice a todas las personas que alrededor del mundo colaboran para financiar sue\u00f1os, que sigan creyendo en la gente, porque cuando dejen de creer se podr\u00e1n perder muchos emprendedores. ","en":"Esther, who is 62, was originally from Bol\u00edvar in the north of Ecuador but moved away from there on account of her parents' work.  She faced a number of obstacles during her education and, as money was tight, received only a primary education.  She married young and became a housewife  but, to her distress, was not able to have children.  For this and other reasons, she and her husband divorced, and this proved a difficult time.  However, this inspirational woman has risen above it all and now lives in Santo Domingo Canton in Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province.  The city of Santo Domingo lies between Ecuador's mountain region and the coast and has become a commercial hub with various growth industries. Proof of this can be seen in the number of enterprising families who set up small business a few years ago and now are microentrepreneurs who play their part in generating employment.  Studies show that a hands-on approach was employed in the setting-up of these businesses which have been well-received by the tourists, business people and travellers who travel between regions.  Furthermore, Santo Domingo is the third most populous city in the country.  For the last 6 years, Esther has sold cosmetics and household items, chiefly to women.  Her sales earn her bonuses in the form of toiletries and other items for her own use.  She spends several hours each morning and afternoon walking around her city's long streets taking orders from her customers, promoting her products and collecting payments for previous sales.  She is now requesting a loan which she will use to buy merchandise in bulk.  This will enable her to qualify for a bigger discount, and, as a result, offer competitive prices to her customers.  With the extra income, Esther will pay off some debts and, in addition, will  have much-needed repairs carried out on the exterior and interior fittings of her home.  Thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who, via Kiva, will help her finance this dream, she feels calm because, in addition to being well treated, she has been assessed by her officer, who has instilled in her agility and confidence in dealing with official procedures.  Esther asks all those, the world over, who work together to finance dreams, to continue believing in people because, if they stop believing, many entrepreneurs could be lost."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1160.84,"image":{"id":1313854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She had seven children whom she raised and to whom she has provided an education so that they could become independent.  She lives in a home of her own, along with her husband, Arturo who provides her the strength to move forward.

She buys all of her merchandise in the mall in town and takes it to the surrounding zones and districts.\r\n\r\nShe began doing this because of her husband\u2019s idea and initiative more than five years ago.  Things have been going well with her work although her work is sometimes a bit difficult because of the trips she makes and because she has to carry her merchandise herself but she knows that she has to put forth the maximum effort in order to be able to maximize her earnings.  Even though she makes many sales, she would like to maximize her earnings and sell in large volume, so she wants to keep working and grow her business.  This will be her third loan through Kiva and she hopes to be able to count on your support so that she can continue her objectives.  She is committed to making her payments on time.  She is asking for 1,500 PEN in order to buy second hand clothing in quantity.  She is looking for low prices by buying in volume and in this way she can increase her income. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1314435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-18T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":227.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":238.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":247.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":248.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":265.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":272.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.1},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.1,"local_amount":227.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":236.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869122,"comment":null},{"amount":95.31,"local_amount":238.27,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":247.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577966,"comment":null},{"amount":98.86,"local_amount":247.16,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:13Z","rounded_local_amount":256.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530195,"comment":null},{"amount":99.56,"local_amount":248.9,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":258.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975226,"comment":null},{"amount":106.27,"local_amount":265.66,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":275.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996491,"comment":null},{"amount":108.9,"local_amount":272.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:23:29Z","rounded_local_amount":282.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863974,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T17:28:20Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:23:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":538948,"name":"Berawan Salak Permai Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ni Kadek works raising pigs.

They have a pig, a calf and two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese production.  They also have 0.8 hectares of agricultural land and a vineyard with 800 samples of grapevines. They harvest grapes and make wine for selling. The income is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIoseb requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Ioseb will build a shed for chicks. After the shed is built he will be able to purchase chicks and raise them for selling, and thereby increase the income of the family.

With the received credit Eka will build a shed for chicks. After the shed is built she will be able to purchase chicks, raise them to sell, and increase the income of the family.

In particular, they have two pigs and sell piglets seasonally. In addition, they have a vineyard with 600 samples of wine trees. They produce wine for selling locally. There is hardly enough income to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBesik requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of their low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBesik has now requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the credit received, Besik will purchase a minibus. After purchasing a minibus, Besik will be able to work for a private company, which produces metal equipment. Besik will transport the equipment with his minibus and increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Harriet is 20 years old and lives in the town of Mubende, in Uganda. She is single and has two children, one of them currently in school. For the past two years, Harriet has been working hard to manage her faming business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Harriet has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. She will use the loan to buy more seeds for planting, such as beans and maize. The additional seeds will help Harriet to generate greater profits, and to acquire a restaurant. Harriet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nHarriet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1315165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

is 27 years old from the small village in the Gurjaani district. He has a large family: parents, wife, an infant son, brother, daughter-in-law and nephew. Valeri requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where 70 peach trees are grown. In addition, Valeri has a tractor, which is used for tilling services. Valeri serves local people for tilling services and earns money. It is hardly enough to provide food for such a large family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nValeri requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

","en":"Nargiza was born in a mountain village in Kyrgyzstan. She is married and raising one son. Nargiza was born in a simple farmer family. She was the youngest daughter and always helped her mother to care for the house and her father to care for the livestock, as her older sisters and brothers were adults and lived separately with their own families.\r\n\r\nAfter she got married, she and her husband started a business of livestock breeding with 30,000 som (KGS). Currently Nargiza has two dairy cows and nine sheep on her farm, allowing the family to get a monthly income in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and reselling livestock. They also have four bulls and four horses. \r\n\r\nTo increase the number of livestock and the size of the barn, Nargiza turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase sheep and cows. Nargiza plans to further successfully develop her business, which will help her realize her dream of building a house.

Unfortunately, because she didn't have the money and she had to work from a very young age, Marcelina wasn't able to study business administration, but she would like to have been able to do so.  In her free time she likes to cook a delicious chicken stew to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with a lot of effort and dedication, Marcelina works in her small business selling school and office supplies.  She works every day for approximately 10 hours.  She believes it's going well for her because of the variety of products and her good customer service.\r\n\r\nMarcelina's very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she'll be able to buy a small sales stall in the main market of her city.\r\n\r\nThis way Marcelina will be able to continue working and making the effort to achieve her big dream of expanding her business and having a great bookstore.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":547.27,"image":{"id":1315491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a sales stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-18T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-17T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":143.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":151.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":155.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":161.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":169.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":174.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":182.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":188.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":203.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.66,"local_amount":133.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":134.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483376,"comment":null},{"amount":54.58,"local_amount":140.86,"processed_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":141.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889411,"comment":null},{"amount":55.79,"local_amount":143.96,"processed_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":144.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664311,"comment":null},{"amount":58.73,"local_amount":151.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775654,"comment":null},{"amount":60.24,"local_amount":155.45,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779045,"comment":null},{"amount":62.58,"local_amount":161.49,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":162.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054224,"comment":null},{"amount":65.56,"local_amount":169.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":170.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819153,"comment":null},{"amount":67.56,"local_amount":174.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":175.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472128,"comment":null},{"amount":70.57,"local_amount":182.12,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":183.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694650,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-19T01:34:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":539286,"name":"Floridalma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Floridalma, tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera, tiene 7 hijos y vive con tres de ellos en una aldea que pertenece a la Entrada, Copan.

is 36 years old from Ozurgeti district. He is married and lives with his wife and two children. Rezo requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business startup but without success. The only source of the income for the family has been from the clothing Rezo buys and resells to villagers. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n<p>\r\nThe reason Rezo was rejected for a loan was because of the family\u2019s low income and poor living conditions. In most cases the rural poor do not have access to loans because they are regarded as high-risk borrowers.

He gained a lot of experience because of this, which is reflected in his good production. He grows peas, corn, and potatoes, but the peas bring the greatest satisfaction. He plants on land that he rents from others in the area. For this reason, his production is large. \"I've worked this way for years, so I have to hire trucks to take my harvest to market,\" he says.

is 39 years old, and is married with five children, who are all at school. \r\n\r\nAs a way of taking good care of his family, Nowa started up a hardware business as a major source of income.The business is located at Karuguza, on the outskirts of Kagadi town, and his customers are residents of the area.\r\n\r\nNowa is always challenged by the means of transport from his home to his business.

In winter his animals stay in the barn and in the warm season the roam the pasture, where they stay until November. Meat and dairy products, which come from his animals, he sells to his townsman's in Vanadzor. He has many customers and the profit from his activity allows him to meet his family\u2019s needs.\r\nSo Stepan is requesting a loan from Kiva to buy four cows.

was born July 6th, 1970 into a family of farmers.  She is married and the mother of two children ages of 12 and 21.  She currently works with livestock.  Since 2003 she has worked on breeding cattle as well as farming.

is married with five children who are all school-going and he is in charge of paying their school fees plus meeting all the basic needs of the family. He is into an agricultural trade business and it is from this that he has managed to take care of the needs of his family. In addition to agricultural trade, Tadeo trades in local brew commonly known as 'waragi' to supplement his income.\r\n\r\nHe wants a loan of 2,000,000 UGX. With the loan he will be able to renovate his residential house that is in a sorry state as witnessed in the picture. Apparently he is not safe from rodents like rats and ants which access his house easily due to the aged wood.

She makes a monthly trip to the city in order to stock her business.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Brigida hopes to save up enough money to open a store in another location in her town so that she can better serve her loyal customers, who are mainly farmers.

a young professional soccer player in Italy, Khosrow never dreamed he would one day be a business owner in the US.  After living in Italy and France for 35 years, Khosrow wanted to provide a better life with more opportunity for his daughter and moved his family to the US in 2002.  It was not an easy move, but the struggle to start a life in a new country empowered Khosrow to start his own business. \n\nHaving lived in the south of France for many years, Khosrow had a deep appreciation for the specialty tablecloths and napkins from the Provence region.  His enthusiasm sparked a business idea\u2014to provide quality tablecloths and impeccable service to Americans. Khosrow\u2019s idea quickly flourished into a successful local shop, Desire. \n\nThe recent recession pushed Khosrow to move his business to farmers\u2019 markets and close his shop in 2007.   Although a major decision, Khosrow found that he still retained much of the business he had established and enjoyed the personal interaction with customers at the markets.  His daily motto is, \u201cIf you are good and honest, people come back to you.\u201d\n\nHowever, in 2008, more disaster struck.  A break-in occurred at Khosrow\u2019s warehouse and over $97,000 in inventory was stolen.  Devastated, Khosrow picked up what was left of his business and started over using all that he had left.  His loyal clientele stood behind him and bit-by-bit Khosrow was able to regain some of his losses.\n\nSince then, Khosrow has continued to work almost every day selling his specialty tablecloths, napkins and other Jacquard fabrics from Provence.  With this Kiva loan, Khosrow will be able to purchase more inventory to be able to open another booth at a secondary market every day, reaching more customers.  Khosrow\u2019s goal is to hire an employee and teach them his daily motto and the benefits of being a smart business owner."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1863.38,"image":{"id":1315760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to
