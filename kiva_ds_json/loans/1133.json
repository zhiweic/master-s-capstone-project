Her husband is the major support for her in this business. She sells meat at the central bazaar for profits. In Azerbaijan, there is a high demand for meat because it is used in a lot of meals, such as kufta (soup), kababs, dolma, etc. Her income from this business is AZN 100 per month.

She is a widow, and has several children.  She lives with her family in a house that she has that is made of adobe.  She has some land that she bought when she was very young with the help of her deceased husband, so that they could work the land and support their children.  Once she was left a widow, she saw the need to work independently, often making use of the help of workers in the area.  On her land, she cultivates a variety of products that she considers to be profitable, such as: organic cocoa, coffee, and other products.  Over the years, and thanks to her work, she managed to buy other land where she decided to plant more cocoa trees, because compared to other products they are easier to care for.  With the sales of the dried beans to the buyers in the area, it is possible to recover the money invested and also earn good profits.  \r\n\r\nIn order to carry out her work well, she needs money so that she can maintain her lands with activities such as weed removal with the help of workers from the area, and with products such as organic fertilizers.  This is the third time that Kiva has provided her with a loan, because she is a member who is on time with her payments and has demonstrated that thanks to the loans that she has been receiving, her quality of life has been improving.  At this time, she wants to take a loan of 1,000 Peruvian soles to buy organic fertilizer and to fertilize her plants with the help of laborers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":247.56,"image":{"id":1361815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

","en":"Ana is a twenty-one-year-old woman.  When she completed secondary school, she began working to support her household.  She decided to move in with her partner Edgar, who is twenty-four and has worked as a bricklayer from a very early age.  Together they have a son, and they dream that one day he will have a professional career.  For this reason they work hard so that their son will have everything he needs.\r\n\r\nThey live in Pastaza, a canton in the province if the same name, in the Amazonian region of Ecuador.  The seat of the canton is the city of Puyo, which is located in the middle of the Amazonian forest in the west of the province, at an altitude of 924 meters above sea level.  The area is not heavily populated, but there are a great number of sites that are popular with domestic and international tourists, especially having to do with ecological activity and extreme sports.  The city is growing economically every day from commercial activity, livestock, agriculture and tourism.  Financial and commercial firms have opened branches here in order to take advantage of the economic activity of this small city.\r\n\r\nThere are many people here who have not given up due to lack of employment opportunities, but who instead have started their own businesses in order to live a dignified life and make their dreams a reality.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Ana has been selling different brands of cosmetics.  She sells her products on the long streets of her city, calling on customers, the majority of whom are women, also collecting payments and delivering her products.  She started this business so that she could share in the household expenses and also cover some personal expenses.  Many times, her customers ask for products that they need immediately, and this is an opportunity to obtain additional income.  \r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is seeking a loan so that she can build up her inventory and obtain higher profits.

Celedonio.  The couple have seven children and live in a wooden house that they worked hard to buy.\r\n\r\nEdilberta grows plants which are native to her region such as organic cacao, coffee, etc.  She grows them on a plot of farmland that she bought with the help of her husband when she was young so that she could financially support her children.  Edilberta has been farming with her husband for 18 years and, on more than one occasion, she has hired local workers to help finish off the farming tasks more quickly so that she can benefit from uniform growth on all her fields.  Edilberta has more cacao trees on her land than anything else because cacao is a product which is in good demand in her area and it is possible to recoup her investment with better additional profits.  Edilberta's work enables her to financially support her children so that she can send them to school and cover their other expenses.  However, she hopes over time that she will also be able to improve her home, building it from solid materials, so that she can give her family a better environment in which to live.\r\n\r\nThis is Edilberta's second loan from Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support that she is receiving as it helps her to continue in her work.  She will use the 1,000 soles she has requested to buy organic compost with which to nourish her crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":247.56,"image":{"id":1361821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She\u2019s a very hardworking, cheerful woman.  \r\n\r\nAle, as she\u2019s affectionately called, sells bedspreads, shoes and clothes for women and men by catalog.  She says she started this business to help her husband with household expenses since she has four children and was unable to work outside the home because her grandmother also lives with her and she\u2019s not well and she must take care of her.  She says that\u2019s why she decided to start her own business so she could stay and care for her home.  \r\n\r\nShe gets her children ready for school in the morning and then makes breakfast for her grandmother and for her since her husband leaves for work very early in the morning.  She does her cleaning chores and then heads out to sell bedspreads house to house; sometimes her customers come to her house looking for her to order something or other.  \r\n\r\nShe says that she gets the things she sells from authorized suppliers in the city of Zit\u00e1cuaro so she can get better prices.  At the moment, she\u2019s asking for a loan to fill some pending customer orders.  She comments that this is the month when sales are highest because of Mother\u2019s Day, Teacher\u2019s Day, Student\u2019s Day and the end of the school term; people take advantage of this to give gifts and they come to her to buy shoes and clothes.  This is why she wants to be well-stocked right now.  Alejandra thanks VisionFund for the trust they\u2019ve placed in her and for giving her loans to improve her business thus helping her husband, children and grandmother.  \r\n\r\nThe other group members are named Consuelo, Florentina, Esperanza, Tomasa, Blanca Estela, Maricela, Martha, Liliana, Reynalda and Sof\u00eda.  They will invest in their businesses which are: silkscreen shop, grocery store, Mexican fast-food snacks, bread baking, fine and costume jewelry making, vehicle repair shop and feed for fattening up chickens for subsequent sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":1359858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

So three years ago Kishwar began stitching work in her house to contribute to the family income. Kishwar is an expert in stitching trousers and has made her mark with it. She purchases open cloth from the market and then makes trousers and sells them to the people of her vicinity. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s her third year with Kiva partner Kashf Foundation.  She is currently requesting a loan of Rs. 20,000 in order to buy cloth, thread and zippers in large quantities. She expects to boost her earnings and wishes to spend part of the profits on the betterment of her family members.

Her loan requests have been rejected due to low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nZoia owns a bakery. She is baking pastries and her daughter is selling them. The family is working very hard to get a small monthly income. \r\n\r\nZoia requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Zoia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

There are also tourist attractions like \"l\u00edneas de Nazca\", which has visitors throughout the year. When he has free time, German enjoys to go on walks and eat his one of his favorite meals, delicious pork rinds. Because of his limited economic resources, he was only able to complete the fifth grade, but he would have liked to have studied medicine. German works very hard day to day as a farmer. He has grown cacti to attract cochineal (insects from which the crimson-colored dye carmine is derived), and works around seven hours a day because he is always making sure that his crop is in good condition. He believes his work is going well because he is responsible and dedicated to what he does.

Juan is a very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who dedicates all of his efforts into making headway for his little one, since he is both father and mother to her. Sadly as a result of limited economic resources and the need to work from a very young age, Juan was not able to pursue a professional degree in computer and information sciences. In his free time he likes to play with his daughter and sometimes cook a delicious Lomo Saltado (a traditional dish) to share with his family. On his own initiative and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Juan works in his small business selling groceries. He works every day for approximately 10 hours and believes it is going well thanks to his good prices and the way he treats others. Juan is very grateful for Kiva lenders, since thanks to your help he will be able to buy a sales post in a market in the city. In this way Juan will have a stable location and a place of his own where he can tend to his customers so he can continue working hard to achieve his biggest dream of having his own home.

His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of land, where potatoes are grown and they maintain 17 beehives. They sell the harvested potatoes and honey at a good price, but it is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRoman requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Roman has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people  who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Roman will purchase calves. After the calves are grown, they will be able to produce dairy products to sell, increasing the income of their family.

They have four children and all live together in a house made of sun-dried bricks.  Paulina comes from a poor background.  She mainly makes her living in agriculture but occasionally she collects plastic bottles to sell to large recycling plants.  Paulina has a plot of land where she grows turmeric, organic cacao and other profitable products such as mullein.  Paulina has been doing this work for 28 years and, with the money she has made over the years, she recently bought another plot of land.  When the harvest comes around, Paulina hires local labourers to support her and collect the various fruits more quickly.  What Paulina likes about her work is seeing that her harvest are good quality, which allows her to earn back the money she has invested.  However, one of her biggest problems is transporting her products from her land to sales outlets.  This is Paulina's third Kiva loan and she is very grateful for the financial support provided, which allows her to continue moving forward.  On this occasion she is applying for 1000 Nuevo Soles in order to buy organic fertiliser for her crops.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":247.56,"image":{"id":1361902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T07:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T07:50:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":103.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":103.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":112.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":116.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.36,"local_amount":75.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975761,"comment":null},{"amount":34.25,"local_amount":91.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":91.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997028,"comment":null},{"amount":35.37,"local_amount":94.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":94.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864498,"comment":null},{"amount":34.22,"local_amount":91.24,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":91.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352866,"comment":null},{"amount":37.66,"local_amount":100.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":100.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904636,"comment":null},{"amount":38.91,"local_amount":103.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":104.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090653,"comment":null},{"amount":38.79,"local_amount":103.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":103.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T23:56:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566963,"name":"Orencio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Orencio earns a living through his vegetable farming business for more than 8 years now.

The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

He works an average ten hours a day and believes things are going well for him because of his kindness to others.\r\n\r\nJorge is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to your help he will be able to renovate his home.  He wants to cover the outside walls of his house because it is in disrepair and does not look good.  This will give Jorge and his family added safety and well being, allowing him to continue working and striving toward his goal of having his own house and family one day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1361933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To renovate his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T10:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T10:10:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Guillermo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":101.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":108.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":123.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.58,"local_amount":81.54,"processed_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":81.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664562,"comment":null},{"amount":31.2,"local_amount":83.21,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776160,"comment":null},{"amount":31.93,"local_amount":85.15,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":85.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779271,"comment":null},{"amount":33.27,"local_amount":88.71,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":89.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054454,"comment":null},{"amount":35.1,"local_amount":93.6,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":94.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819364,"comment":null},{"amount":287.92,"local_amount":767.79,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":771.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472316,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T16:18:38Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:25:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566455,"name":"Mujeres Unidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mujeres Unidas es de la Ciudad de San Pedro,  tiene 14 integrantes, todas ellas mujeres luchadoras que desean poder ayudar a sus familias a salir adelante y darles todo lo que ellas no pudieron tener.\nLa se\u00f1ora Crecencia es una se\u00f1ora muy trabajadora que empez\u00f3 apenas teniendo un cerdo y unas pocas gallinas, actualmente y gracias al esfuerzo que est\u00e1 haciendo pudo ir creciendo y tener mayor cantidad de animales.\nEl cr\u00e9dito solicitado a la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya lo quiere invertir en la compra de cerdos para poder criarlos y tambi\u00e9n para faenarlos y venderlos.

He lives in Laredo, which borders Mexico along the Rio Grande in Texas. There are many different types of Mexican restaurants there, but there were few serving the traditional fried plantain dishes of his home country. Fortunately for Melvin J. and Laredo, his wife is an excellent cook. Together, the couple decided to open a Caribbean restaurant called Restaurant Grandes Ligas last year. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe saw an opportunity,\u201d Melvin J. said.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant is open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day of the week. Melvin J. said he works the front of the restaurant and his wife works the back as the cook. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, and offer everything from jelly-filled Cuban breads to licuados de mamay or papaya \u2013 tropical fruit smoothies -- for breakfast. In addition to serving mofongo con camaron \u2013 fried mashed plantains covered in a shrimp stew \u2013 Grandes Ligas serves tacos and other Mexican food.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople asked for the breakfast tacos, so we offer them,\u201d he said. \r\n\r\nWhen Melvin J. realized he needed some help with financing the painting and operation of his restaurant, he knew to apply with Accion Texas Inc. One and a half years ago, Melvin J. applied for and received a $500 Accion Texas loan to stock the shelves of another business he owns \u2013 a bot\u00e1nica or traditional herbs and medicines store called Yerberia San Miguel. He quickly paid Accion back and knew that doing so would help him build his credit and become eligible for a larger loan.\r\n\r\nAt his restaurant, Melvin J. said he serves a loyal clientele of people who love his wife\u2019s cooking and the cozy atmosphere dedicated to Major League Baseball.

is a member of the group called Trabajando para el futuro (Working for the future), located in the city of Puerto Plata. Yudelka is the single mother of 4 children and she lives together with them in her unfinished house. This is her 6th loan, which she will use to improve her house. She has had her business for around five years. Since then she has paid back all her loans and expanded her business. After her last loan, which she invested in her business, she realized the need to finish building her home structure. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she talked to other members of her group and they recommended her for a housing loan to improve her home by building some concrete blocks walls and covering them with cement. She will also change a part of her zinc roof that is very damaged. This loan, along with some savings she had from her business profits, will be used totally to buy all the materials to improve those areas.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups.

He reflects that his time there taught him just how important your team is and how important it is for each member to work hard.\r\n\r\nIn January 2011, Sean started his own construction firm, fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming an entrepreneur.  Almost two and a half years later, Sean's business has grown and expanded, providing Sean with the opportunity to positively affect the lives of many individuals and their families.  For Sean, the best part of his job is providing quality service in home renovation that not only creates a beautiful new space, but also restores and protects the special memories of the homeowner.  \r\n\r\nA loan of $7,332.90 will enable Sean to purchase equipment necessary to expand his construction business further.  Sean will also use the loan to pursue a public works contract in San Diego to restore historic San Diego buildings.  This is a huge growth opportunity for Sean and his business. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sean hopes to grow his business to the point where he can add jobs to the community and mentor younger generations in his trade.  Currently, Sean hires three part-time contractors as needed, but with further expansion, he can hire full-time employees and achieve his dream of passing on his craft.

","en":"Turdimurod is a cheerful man of 50. He is married and has only one child. He and his wife always dreamed to have many children, but due to their health they only managed to have one, their long-awaited and beloved son. The two have dedicated their life to him and are doing everything they can to provide for him. They live modestly but happiness never leaves their house. All their neighbors appreciate this family's generous soul. Turdimurod himself is an experienced farmer and has been farming for 20 years. He has his own land where he grows grain. This is his main source of income and he makes good profits from his farm. Turdimurod also has cattle which he raises for resale. His wife helps take care of the animals and she also sells their milk. The grain harvest is the main stable income for the family so Turdimurod wants to increase his harvest and be able to earn more from it. For this reason Turdimurod has turned to Arvand for a loan which he will use to buy seeds for various grain crops. He thanks everyone in Arvand in advance for their

has two goals: to graduate from college and to be his own boss. He is accomplishing both of his dreams. He started a commercial cleaning business five years ago and managed commercial cleaning contracts part-time while working on his accounting degree at Southern University. Last year, he incorporated and renamed his business to A. Commercial Cleaning Inc. He graduates from college at the end of the year.\r\n\r\nDuran said while he initially started the business to finance college and to fit work into his school schedule, he has big plans to grow his business once he graduates.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I like what I do,\u201d Duran said. \u201cI've been doing this for five years and we've started growing a lot. We're in the process of getting an office set up. Our goal is to be operating at least 100 cleaning contracts.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently, Duran manages 15 cleaning contracts and employs two workers full-time and three part-time. He plans to hire five more part-time workers, but hopes someday to hire at least 50. He said what distinguishes his business from others is the follow-through and quality control.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat separates us from other businesses is that we are very proactive with what we do,\u201d Duran said. \u201cWe have a field manager. And the field manager does drop in on a job to make sure the cleaning is up to par. And if there is a problem, he fixes it right then and there. Our belief is that we want to catch a problem before you do.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo expand his services, Duran needed to buy a carpet cleaner and a floor buffer for his business but didn\u2019t have the capital up front. He learned about Accion Louisiana \u2013 Accion Texas\u2019s branch in Baton Rouge \u2013 from the Louisiana Small Business Development Center. \r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a great experience, working with Accion,\u201d Duran said. \u201cI will refer as many people as possible to them.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuran said he is excited about finishing his degree. And while he acknowledges he could get a job in corporate America with his college degree, he said he prefers to be an entrepreneur. \u201cI love being my own boss,\u201d Duran said. \u201cYou have to work very hard, but I love the freedom it has offered

lives in the Ndaragwa area of Kenya, which has one of the cooler climates in Kenya. She has 6 children and has been doing this work for 20 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Taking care of my dairy cows'. Her biggest challenge is 'Feeding the animals.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Kanji, Varentine (all cows).'\r\n\r\nShellmith was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'It's easy to borrow.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: 'They assist people to get loans with little security.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

She has a high school education but had a child when she was still very young and had to face the great difficulties that accompany the responsibility of educating a child alone.  Her son is now an adult and lives independently which fills Rosa with pride.  Now this tenacious, entrepreneurial mother lives alone in R\u00edo Verde parish in Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province.  This city has a lot of commercial activity as it has become an important dry port where commercial exchanges are made between the mountainous and coastal regions of the country.  Its various tourist attractions, together with its warm weather, make it very popular with tourists from both at home and abroad.  Most of the locals run some kind of commercial or service-based business aimed at local people and tourists. \r\n\r\nRosa inherited her entrepreneurial spirit from her mother who taught her to run her own business, which she has kept running for the last 10 years.  It is how she has earned her living and she works at least 12 hours a day in her store as she opens thr doors when the day has barely begun to supply local housewives and students who are beginning their day before dawn, and she closes the doors when it gets dark and everybody is already home relaxing.  \r\n\r\nRosa has grown alongside her business and has seen that her customers have a lot of demands which go unfulfilled.  For this reason, she would like to increase the variety of products she offers so that she can meet the needs of all her customers.  She is requesting a loan to invest in buying food products, candies, drinks and toiletries so that she can increase her range of products and increase her sales.  This will make her more profits which will allow her to improve her quality of life and save up enough to cover any unanticipated health and food needs in the future.  Rosa is grateful to Kiva lenders who sponsor her micro-business.  She is also thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for putting their trust in her and enabling her to take this step towards growing her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1361856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise and increase the variety of products she sells","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660.7,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":85.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":91.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":92.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":94.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":96.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":98.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":101.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.11,"local_amount":85.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313799,"comment":null},{"amount":93.13,"local_amount":91.16,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":93.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565406,"comment":null},{"amount":94.73,"local_amount":92.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":94.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814444,"comment":null},{"amount":97.69,"local_amount":95.62,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":97.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320617,"comment":null},{"amount":99.07,"local_amount":96.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":99.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856307,"comment":null},{"amount":101.99,"local_amount":99.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":101.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059882,"comment":null},{"amount":101.28,"local_amount":99.14,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995225,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-09T21:01:59Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566749,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Virginia tiene 71 a\u00f1os de edad, esta acompa\u00f1ada y tiene cinco hijos, de los cuales solo tres viven con ella.

is 52 years old and lives with his wife and two daughters in the village of David-Bek which is in Kapan area. Both David\u2019s daughters are students of the State Armenian Pedagogical University.  Artush graduated from Kapan Technical College as a decorator-designer. Now Artush works in Kapan electrical station. His wife is a nurse and works in Kapan hospital.\r\n\r\nSince 2000, Artush has been engaged in an agricultural business. He has built a large barn for animals and breeds cows and piglets. His wife helps him in their farm and as Artush said without his wife\u2019s help he couldn't overcome all the difficulties of an agricultural business. Artush is a very worthy farmer and he cares about his animals with big pleasure and also carefully.

mayor anhelo era terminar la secundaria, por lo que empez\u00f3 a trabajar para poder pagarse los estudios con sus propios recursos, y as\u00ed en poco tiempo poder obtener su bachillerato internacional para el cual est\u00e1 estudiando sin darse por vencida ante las adversidades, pues muchas veces se juega su propia seguridad al trasladarse al centro de la ciudad buscando un centro de c\u00f3mputo para realizar sus tareas. Adriana vive en una parroquia alejada del pueblo de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nLa hermana de Adriana es costurera titulada y le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a Adriana la actividad de arreglar y confeccionar ropa casual. Adriana realiza varios arreglos en el d\u00eda, pues dedica en la semana 2 horas para terminar trabajos pendientes y los domingos pasa 12 horas en su m\u00e1quina para dejar todos los trabajos pendientes listos. En temporada de vacaciones ella trabaja m\u00e1s d\u00edas en la semana, mejorando as\u00ed sus ingresos. Esta jovencita emprendedora y luchadora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de un computador para as\u00ed poder tener en su casa acceso a la tecnolog\u00eda para realizar sus tareas y de este modo ahorrar en trasporte, impresiones y alquiler que pagaba en los diferentes centros de c\u00f3mputo. Adem\u00e1s estar\u00e1 m\u00e1s segura en casa y el tiempo que le tomaba en transportarse, ella lo podr\u00e1 invertir en realizar m\u00e1s trabajos de costura.\nAdriana agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por creer en ella y en sus sue\u00f1os, pues si no le abr\u00edan las puertas, ella no ten\u00eda la oportunidad de conseguir financiamiento para su computador y tambi\u00e9n agradece a los inversionistas que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva le ayudar\u00e1n aun sin conocerla, esto es muy valioso para ella.","en":"Adriana is a very young woman, 18 years old. Her greatest wish is to graduate high school, and she is proud to say she has had her family's full support until now. Nevertheless, she started to work in order to pay for her studies out of her own pocket, in order to finish the last year of high school and obtain the international diploma she has studied for. She refuses to admit defeat in the face of adversity, which is why, at great personal risk, she travels to the centre of the city to do her homework on a computer in a cybercaf\u00e9. Adriana lives in a remote village called Salcedo, located in Oriente de Cotopaxi Province, one of the most important provinces in the Ecuadorian mountains. This village attracts tourists with its lagoons and other bodies of water, suited for tourists looking for a thrill and extreme sports. However, agriculture, followed by animal husbandry, are still the main economic resources of the village. Despite the presence of a functioning economy, it is a very poor village, with worrying statistics of illiteracy and poverty, because many basic necessities are unevenly distributed. For instance, only 25% of homes are connected to the sewer system. Adriana's sister is a certified seamstress, and she taught Adriana how to mend as well as how to make casual clothes. Adriana does many such mendings in a day, since she works at her sewing machine two hours a day and twelve on Sundays. During school holidays, she works a bit more during the week, in order to increase her income. This enterprising and brave young woman asks for a loan that she will use to buy a computer, so as to have access in her own home to the technology she needs to complete her school assignments. This way, she will be able to save money on transportation and on cybercaf\u00e9 and printing fees.

Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n\r\nShe completed 10th grade and is married. She describes herself as a hard-working woman. Her spouse works with Firestone as security. She has five children between 17 and 8, who are in school and live at home.\r\n\r\nIda has a shop which sells cold water and soft drinks. She has been in business for 10 years and works 10 hours per day. With this loan, she will buy more inventory. One of the greatest challenges that she faces is low income. She transports her goods by taxi. She started her business with money from her husband. She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. Her future plan is to own a house.

is from Iraq. He is 43 years old, married and a father of a single child. Kassem works hard to provide the family income while his wife takes care of their children.\r\n\r\nKassem owns a small shop where he sells cements which are used for construction purposes. He has been in this field since 1990 and has gained good experience. Now, Kassem has 3 employees and is well-known in the surrounding area with an excellent reputation.\r\n\r\nKassem is requesting a loan of $2,000.
