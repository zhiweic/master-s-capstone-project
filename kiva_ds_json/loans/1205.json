is 49 years old. He is married and lives in the village of Velistsikhe with his spouse, two sons and retired mother. Gela leads the family's agriculture business. In particular, he owns a vineyard and a plot of land where peaches are grown. The family always has quality products and sells them among fruit retailers. As the income from the agriculture business is seasonal and is not enough for consuming, Gela decided to apply for a loan and start an animal husbandry business to generate income.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Gela will purchase calves.

","en":"Anvar is a kind and honest person.  He is 48 years old.  He is married and is raising two children.  His oldest child is 21 years old and the youngest one is 15 years old.  Because Anvar is the sole breadwinner for his entire family, they struggle financially.  His wife is a homemaker.  For more than 15 years Anvar has been cultivating crops such as rice, eggplants and turnips.  He has a lot of experience in farming.  Currently, he is growing vegetables on 1.15 hectares of land.  Using the profits from his farming, Anvar began to build a house, but he was unable to finish its construction when the money ran out.  This year, he wishes to complete the construction of his home.  He is asking for a loan of 5,000 Somoni to purchase the building materials needed to complete his house.  He is waiting for your kindness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1419965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She and her husband practice farming; they grow coffee and keep dairy cows on zero grazing. Seasonally, they are also employed as casuals at a tea farm to pick tea, and this supplements what they get from the farming business. With three children in school, they barely have enough to save and have electricity installed for them. \r\n\r\nTheir source of energy for lighting is kerosene, and for cooking it is firewood and charcoal. Every month, they spend at least $35 on purchasing fuel, and this is a huge sacrifice, since they have to cook and the children need light to study in the evening.  \r\n\r\nWith their four cows, Grace can be able to save this money and enjoy cleaner, better, cheaper fuel for cooking and lighting by having a bio-digester constructed for her. With a loan VEP hopes to assist Grace in getting this bio-digester. In addition to cleaner fuel, she will also be using the bio-slurry to grow fodder and food crops so that she can also save money used on buying manure from other farmers. This will increase her crop production, and we hope in the future, she can start up a business of selling green groceries. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":191.68,"image":{"id":1421657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To construct a bio-digester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kiambu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.166667 36.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-09-04T05:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-04T05:20:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace Wambui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4159}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T09:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4202.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410681399,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4202.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419987588,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4202.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429639963,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4202.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867617,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-04T18:31:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":602068,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 40-year-old Lucy from Tombo Western rural area in Freetown.

is a 30-year-old businesswoman from Liberia.  She is married and has three children between the ages of 1 and 17 years old.  Two of the children are currently attending school and they all live at home.  She completed 7th grade before starting her business. She describes herself as a hard working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nRebecca has had a cook shop business (restaurant), which sells rice and soup for the past 10 years.  She works from 7 am to 6 pm each day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is limited income. She intends to use the loan to buy more rice, pepper, onion, oil, fish, meat, etc. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because it helps to support her home. She hopes to one day to own a house. \r\n \r\nShe wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for their help.

meet 40-year-old Hawa from Buchanan. Buchanan is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea.  It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nHawa did not go to school and she is married.  She describes herself as a hard working woman. Her spouse works as a security man.  They have three children between 2 and 16 years old, only two of whom are in school and live at home. \r\n\r\nHawa has a table where she sells fish.  She has been in business for two years and works from Monday to Saturday, spending 10 hours per day.  With this loan, she will buy more fish.  One of the greatest challenges that she faces is to increase her sales.  She transports her goods by taxi.  She started her business with money from her husband.  She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. Her future plan is to build a house.  She thanks you in advance for your

is a 32-year-old businesswoman from Liberia.  She is unmarried and has five children, aged between 3 and 19.  Only four are currently attending school and they all live at home.  She was unfortunate not to attend school.  She describes herself as a hard working woman.\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County, which is located by the sea.  It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia. \r\nMarthaline has a table business which has been selling palm oil, soap, pepper, milk, sardine, etc for the past four years.  She works from 8am to 5pm every day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is making enough income. She intends to use the loan to buy more palm oil, soap, pepper, milk, sardine, etc for her business. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because it helps to support her family.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\nShe wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for their help.

is Mammie from Liberia. She resides in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County.  The county is located by the sea and is known for its beaches and fish. In addition, many logging companies are also located in the city. People in Buchanan are known in the country for their love of fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. \r\n\r\nMammie is 30 and married with three children.  Her children are between the ages of 1 and 20. Only one child is currently living at home and two are in school.  \r\n\r\nMammie has had a business selling fish for the past four years. She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more fish for her business. On average, she works 10 hours a day at her business from Monday to Saturday. She started her business with a small amount of money from her fianc\u00e9e. She transports her merchandise by a shared taxi. She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is controlling her own money. In the future, she would like to build a modern shop.  \r\n\r\nShe is grateful for your

meet 50-year-old Juah from Buchanan. Buchanan is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish. Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia. \r\n\r\nJuah finished 7th grade and is single. She describes herself as a hardworking woman. Her children's ages are between 18 and 32, one of whom is in school and lives at home. Juah has been running a table business, selling fish. She has been in this business for 20 years and works from Monday to Saturday spending 10 hours per day. With this loan, she will buy more fish to sell.  \r\n\r\nOne of the greatest challenges that she faces is low income. She transports her goods by taxi. She started her business with money from her husband.  She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. Her future plan is to build a house. She thanks you in advance for your

meet 35-year-old Oretha from Buchanan. Buchanan is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish. Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nOretha stopped her education at grade 7 before getting married. She describes herself as a hardworking woman. She has four children between the ages of 2 and 19. They are in school and live at home. \r\n\r\nOretha has been frying and selling fish, cala (balls of rice), plantain and chicken along the roadside since 2009. She works 10 hours each day at her business. With this loan, she will buy flour, fish, chicken, pepper, etc. for her business. One of the greatest challenges that she faces is the low income. She transports her goods by taxi. She started her business with money from her husband. She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. Her future plan is to build a house. She thanks you in advance for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":84.64,"image":{"id":1421730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

the north of the capital of Esteli. She is father and mother to her two children; as sole provider she takes on all the costs of their upbringing, such as schooling. Martha works every day in a factory producing cigars. She has worked there for around 10 years, and it is her only means of providing for her family. Her working hours are monday to Friday, 7am to 5pm.\r\n\r\nMartha contacted Ceprodel with the aim of requesting a new loan. She has had 9 loans from Ceprodel in the last 10 years, which have helped her improve her living conditions. She is confident her loan will be approved and she will be able to buy wood and zinc sheets to fix her kitchen roof, so she doesn't get wet during winter. She hopes that it will be approved quickly as she is a single mother and doesn't receive any help, and her own income is not sufficient to pay for the materials."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":112.43,"image":{"id":1421769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy wood and zinc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-09-04T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-04T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Erling","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":781.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410065510,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":781.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419829404,"comment":null},{"amount":49.93,"local_amount":1198.44,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-23T09:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1248.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430385171,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T14:54:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":602189,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of three children, Gina works hard to support her family.

40-year-old Mariatu from Jui in the Eastern area in Freetown.

She works at the business 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nMariatu requires a loan in order to buy more clothing material and cosmetics to expand her business.

Santiago loves to study and has always distinguished himself with his strong performance. He wishes to grow personally and professionally. His greatest ambition is to fulfill his dream of becoming the greatest chef, earning a national and international reputation, and helping his family financially. \r\n\r\nEven when he was a small child, Santiago's family noticed his calling to service and how he relished the preparation of a simple meal. For someone so young, Santiago paid great attention to the smallest details, improved his skills, and as he grew older, developed a passion for learning more about the complex art of COOKING. Santiago's secrets, recipes, ingredients, and techniques have been his own unique way of savoring the world, with its flavors and textures. His commitment to his career grows ever stronger and he has the courage to dream of becoming the best.  \r\n\r\nSantiago considers his studies the foundation of his life and believes strongly that education is the key to a better world. His ideal is to contribute to society, influence everyone he meets, and share his knowledge. Santiago hopes that his example will motivate others so that everyone who dreams will never give up and will pursue their dreams, no matter the cost. As a child, Santiago always thought that he'd never give up his culinary dreams. When he looks back, Santiago feels proud that he's pursued those dreams and ambitions even when few people believed he could fulfill them. Santiago believes that he only needs desire and passion, and to never give up in the face of challenges. He will be grateful to anyone who supports him just as he hopes to support others, regardless of social class. \r\n\r\nSantiago believes strongly that we're all equal and were born with talents and abilities that allow us to both to learn and to teach. He says that many people haven't discovered their talents, but that he knows clearly his greatest talent and ability is to love the delicious, mysterious, and endless world of gastronomy.

","en":"Makhbuba lives in Muminobod. She is 34, and has two children, a son and a daughter. She is raising the children by herself. Makhbuba is an excellent seamstress. She has a lot of experience in this field of work, but she hasn't done any sewing work for several years. Her children were small, and she didn't have any time to sit down and do any sewing or embroidery. Now Makhbuba is ready to resume her favorite activity and make dresses for sale, as well as create new  types of dresses. To do this she needs a new, upgraded sewing machine that is quick and easy to set up and operate. With this goal in mind, she has requested a loan in the amount of 1500 US dollars. She awaits your kind assistance.\r\n\r\nMakhbuba has to work a lot to provide for her children. Currently she takes care of livestock on her home property. She is going to sell the animals for an decent price."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":147.5,"image":{"id":1420030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a new, upgraded sewing machine  that is quick and easy to set up and operate","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Muminobod","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-09-04T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-04T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahbuba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":53.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":63.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":69.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":72.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":77.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.1,"local_amount":48.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":48.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419913322,"comment":null},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":49.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":49.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561411,"comment":null},{"amount":50.2,"local_amount":50.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030314,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T14:27:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":602253,"name":"Charlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charlita is 30 years old and lives in Unidos, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental.

is a 42-year-old married woman living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. Her husband makes iron chains by hand in his workshop. The chain is made on a hearth by hammering cut lengths of red hot wrought iron rods into oval links, one link passing through the next to form a cable. Now, the price of iron has increased and he does not have any in stock to make more chains so he is unable to make any chains to sell and earn an income.\n\nNagina requested a loan from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband can buy new iron rod coils and start his business again. Nagina is the mother of six children and it is very difficult to feed all of them in a day. Her dreams are to provide all the necessities to each of her children. Nagina is very thankful to BRAC Pakistan for this honorable favor.

To carry out his work, he gets up very early because he has to look for passengers on the streets of his city.\r\n\r\nHer husband enjoys his work because he can manage his free time and have more time to spend with his family. In addition, he is able to obtain very good earnings. Now her husband feels tranquil and comfortable, because he has a regular income and has more free time. This will be her first loan with Kiva, and she hopes that with your cooperation, her husband will be able to carry out his plans. She promises to make payments on time.\r\n\r\nMaryam requested a loan so that her husband would be able to buy the body of an auto rickshaw.

An ambitious entrepreneur, despite traditional roles and cultural norms, she started her business at the age of 42. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Wafa is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\n\nWafa is now 47 years old, a mother of five children. Since her divorce she provides for the family alone. She started her business on a very small scale five years ago and since than it has been steadily growing, attracting new clients, adding new services, and additional machines to her work-space.\n\nWafa is living in the south of Iraq where, despite relative stability over the past years, conflicts, safety and security issues still complicate life. But Wafa is determined to provide for her family and works hard in her sewing shop day after day. As the pictures show, she mostly works on dresses for women, making the typical home ware dresses that are usually colorful, comfortable and decorated with work-intense details. \n\nWafa started her business five years ago and since than it has been steadily growing attracting new clients with her detailed oriented, quality work. Although her business is still relatively small, her hard work and the potential for growth qualifies her to participate in the WLIFT project and also take a business loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \n\nShe would like to use her loan of $5000 to improve the workshop by renovating it, expanding it, and buying a new sewing machine, and a small generator - all to ensure she can work more efficiently, plan her work better, and provide better and faster services. In addition, she also plans to buy some nice quality fabrics and raw materials with the remaining amount after purchasing the larger goods.  \n\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

She began her business because she was trained in business; she needs to generate income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of enough capital to run her business.\n\nFatu requires a loan in order to buy more wood for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her level of living. \n\nIn the future, Fatu plans to expand her business more than ever.

Ramin\u2019s daughter is leaving the secondary school and is going to enter the university. Ramin is actively involved in agricultural activities. Specifically, he has milk cows and owns a plot of agricultural land, where maize and nut trees are grown. He cultivates the land and does all the agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. The harvested products are sold at local markets. Ramin owns a small car and uses it for displacements from his house to his plot of land. As the existing income is not enough for the family, he decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Ramin applied for the credit to MFO Credo.

The gathered harvest Zhanna's husband sells in the city market and so gathers income for the family's living. \r\n\r\nNow, this hardworking family needs financial support for improving their farm. As this is Zhanna's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. \r\n\r\nThe loan will help Zhanna to renovate the greenhouse and expand the cultivation process. She will also purchase forage for feeding pigs and fertilizer,  which is very important for successful cultivation of the land.\r\n\r\nZhanna waits for lenders' support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":703,"image":{"id":1420840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for the renovation of the greenhouse, forage for feeding pigs, and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Berkanush village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-09-04T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-04T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":123.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":112.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":114.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":118.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117.81},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":121.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":122.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":122.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":124.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":126.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":130.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":353,"local_amount":353,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":353,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420157430,"comment":null},{"amount":114,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308505,"comment":null},{"amount":236,"local_amount":236,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845791,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-02T02:19:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":601644,"name":"Jambuli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jambuli is 50 years old and married.
