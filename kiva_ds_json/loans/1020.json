Since 2011, her husband has been running a vegetable and dried fruit shop.

Julia's work is selling general groceries, such as rice, sugar, flour, and other items. She does her work in a shop which is inside her own house. She comments that she started this work because she had seen the experience of friends who had the same kind of business. Seeing that it was very profitable for them, she decided to invest in this activity and put everything she has into making it a success. Her older son helps her in his free time by serving customers, who become more numerous every day. She likes this business because it seems comfortable, and without too much effort she can generate income to cover her daily expenses. It also lets her have free hours to dedicate to other activities. Equally, it lets her be at home where she can watch and take care of her minor children.

 She is 64 years old and is widowed with two children.  Throughout her whole life, she has worked with all her soul to support her family.  For 12 years she has been a basket weaver - she sells her products at the local market and has her own clients.  She uses her income to support her family.  To earn a bit of extra money, Halima wants to start a new business.  With that goal in mind, she enrolled in the \"Get Ahead\" course organized by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.

She lives with her partner, Cesar who is a salesperson, out of their union they have 3 children of 9, 6 and 4 years of age. She loves them very much and they live comfortably in their own home. Agueda works selling fast food like salchipapas (fried potatoes and sausages), juanes (a traditional chicken and rice meal) and other items. Everyday she prepares her fryer, along with her tables and chairs in the afternoons in a corner in a central area of the Manantay town. She kindly cares for her customers with the support of her partner and eldest son who help her prepare and in their free time.\r\n\r\n<p>Agueda enjoys her business since she gets enough income to pay the household expenses and support her partner. However, she gets tired of having to set up and take down her stall everyday, which is why she would like to be able to rent a place where everything will be ready for her to take care of her customers. She has looked at her profits and with the support of her partner, Agueda plans to rent a place and have more tables and chairs so her customers will be more comfortable.

She is in a domestic partnership with Ricardo, 40 years old, and together they work hard so that they can improve. She lives in her parents\u2019 house while she is in the process of buying her own home. Margarita rents a motorcycle taxi for a living. She bought this second-hand motorcycle for a low price with a loan she got from MFP a few months ago. She rents it out to a driver every day and in exchange charges a daily fee. Thanks to her permanent optimism and desire to excel, she bought a taxi a few years ago, which she also rents out as a public transportation vehicle used in the main streets of the city. Margarita has been doing this for 3 years and thanks to this activity her finances have improved and she could meet some of the needs she had at home. What she likes best about her business as a vehicle owner is that it allows her to generate income from home. The hardest part is having to wake up very early to get the day started, but she understands that in the medium term she will have the best results from her effort. She hopes to buy another motorcycle taxi later on and continue improving. This is the 8th loan she takes from the MFP. Margarita is very happy to know that she has financial support because she can confidently continue her work.

She is from Chinandega, a place located in the western part of the country. Chinandega is a place with people who are very welcoming, hard-working and responsible. Michael's economic activity is providing tailoring services. She has done this work for 5 years. She started it because of the need to have a source of income to support her small child, due to the lack of sources of steady work. In her business, she makes a range of garments such as shirts, skirts, pants, dresses, nightgowns and children's pajamas. Michael needs the loan to invest in working capital, buying tailoring supplies such as satin, fabrics, spools of thread, needles, lace, buttons, linings, ribbons, and oil. Michael is a very hard-working and responsible woman with a desire to grow as a person. She has demonstrated this in her previous loans, with the fulfillment of her payments on time and in the right form. Michael is grateful for the help that the Kiva investors provide to people with few resources and poor countries such as Nicaragua, so that they can find ways to make a living with dignity.

Taking this loan will facilitate Adham's family's living conditions in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. \r\n\r\nIn order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see in fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. \r\n\r\nAs with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is proud of her business because she makes a profit, and with the profit she buys more goods and attends to the needs of her child. She is also grateful to the lenders for their continued support toward her business. Some difficulties she faces are the low sales during the rainy season, and learning to sell from her friends.

In addition, Tite is a mini-bus driver and transports passengers if there are any orders.\r\n\r\nTite has requested a loan to begin a trading business. He will purchase cattle in the villages of his district, transport them with his own car, and sell them at the local open market for a profit.

Also, in the future, the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n\r\nTite's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

","en":"Guljan is 51 years old and has 5 children. Guljan's eldest three children are grown up and work in Moscow. Her remaining daughter and son are students. By nature, Guljan is a level-headed and hardworking person. She has already worked for many years as a librarian in a local library. Her librarian salary is very low, which is why in 1997, in search of a source of income for her family, Guljan began her animal husbandry business with an initial investment of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her perseverance and hard work, Guljan was able to develop her business to generate a monthly profit of 15,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this, Guljan is preparing to marry off her son and needs to expand her agricultural business in order to increase her family's income. Guljan approached the company \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase 4 heifers. In the future, with the help of the cows, she can increase her milk production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1258144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase young cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bala-Saryy village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guljan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":30206.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458871,"comment":null},{"amount":850,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40275.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743659,"comment":null},{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":30206.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426726,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T05:29:33Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509034,"name":"Ngina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngina is a 29 year old married woman.

40-year-old Mariatu from Waterloo in the eastern part of Freetown, Sierra Leone.

She began her business because she needs to create income to support her child's education. She works at the business from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is transportation costs.\r\n\r\nMariatu requires a loan in order to buy more shoe bags and dresses for the festive season. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her standard of living. The other woman featured in the video is the SEP Officer of the Waterloo branch. In the future, Mariatu plans to operate a clothing wholesale business.

from Sierra Leone! This is 30-year-old Mohamed from Waterloo in the eastern area of Freetown. He is married with two children who are two and six years old. One of his children currently attends school. Mohamed was a student but he lost his parent and there was no one to take care of his education, so he decided to start a business at an early age. \r\n\r\nMohamed runs a general stock business at his store in a business market area.  He sells rice and flour. He has been running his business since an early age. He works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week.  He does not have any other source of income.   \r\n\r\nMohamed has requested a loan in order to purchase more rice for resale.

is 34-year-old Adiza. She is married and has two children, aged 17 and 13 years. One is a school-going child. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her because she assists in his schooling and accommodation.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Adiza established her clothing and home product business, which sells shirts, jeans, nappies, knickers, wrappers, towels, powder, bedspreads, creams, and other products. She began her business because she stopped schooling in Class V and has a health problem. She used to assist her mother in operating her business. She later married a contractor who established a small business stall for her. Working six days a week and nine hours a day, she earns about Le 1,950,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nAdiza would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000. She has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase jeans (eight dozen @ Le 360,000); skirts (five dozen @ Le 300,000); and blouses (10 pieces @ Le 12,000).

She is married to a contractor and has four children aged 16, 14, 12, and nine years. All are school going children. In 1996, Isatu B. established her baby clothing and utensils business. She began her business because she came from a poor background; she had to do petty trading after school hours to pay her school fees. Things got harder for her because she had to drop out of school. She was peddling everyday to help her parents and younger ones. She then got married and her husband helped her with a small amount of funds for the business. Since then, she has developed gradually. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 5,481,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nIsatu would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Isatu B has already received and successfully repaid two loans. She now requires a new loan in order to purchase baby powder - 10 dozen @ Le180,000, Baby clothing - 10 dozen @ Le180,000, Baby oil (small size) - 4 dozen @ Le100,000, Flask - 20 pieces @ Le150,000.She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 830,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Isatu B. plans to open a shop and educate her children. The loan will help as it is an additional business capital. Isatu serves about 30 customers per day including women and petty traders around town and villages. Her business is popular because she always has good customer care and good quality goods at affordable prices. She usually travels by vehicle three times in the month to Freetown, and Conakry once every two months to purchase her goods. She saves some of her profit and uses some as an additional capital for the business.  \r\n\r\nShe has enough savings now that she has acquired a piece of land which she is looking forward to developing. She is also planning to expand her business by acquiring more loans and saving enough of her profit. She is hard working and competitive. Isatu B wants to achieve her dreams by educating her children through acquiring subsequent loans.

In this village, there is a separate hamlet called the Mahar community. The main source of livelihood of this community is weaving bamboo baskets. In the year 2010, six poor, illiterate rural women of this hamlet formed a Joint Liability Group named Jaya Ram with the objective of taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the overall development of their family and the improvement of their existing businesses. Basanta, about 43 years old, is the featured member who is sitting in the middle with her hand raised. She is married and resides in a small hut with her husband, one son age 15 and one daughter age 12. Her children are continuing their studies. All members of this group belong to a very poor background far away from all basic needs like education, shelter, health facilities etc.  \r\n\r\nThe business of Basanta (weaving bamboo baskets) is a traditional business in her community. Basanta and her husband do the processing work and weave baskets of different shapes and sizes. They sell their products in the nearest weekly market in their town. Some traders also regularly come to this village to purchase bamboo products. Basanta earns a monthly profit of Rs 2,000\/- from her business. As there is a growing demand for these products to supply to various parts of the country, Basanta wants to purchase more raw bamboo with this loan amount to work for a longer period without any interruption for more output. This will help her to earn some extra income to manage the family smoothly. Basanta hopes to construct a house in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Udia, Sushama, Balamati, Tarulata and Subidha who are doing similar businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1258753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase raw bamboo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Mahulpada,Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T06:40:01Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Udia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balamati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tarulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subidha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":74000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":74000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T10:47:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509214,"name":"Rugiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, Rugiatu earns about 2,980,000 Sierra Leonean leone (Le) every month from this business.

In 2008, Osman Malam established his bags (school bags, traveling bags, casual bags) business. He began his business because as a teenager he was farming with his parents in the village because of his poor background; he was not fortunate enough to attend school. When he grew older, he decided to start a petty trading business. His father wanted him to be a farmer, but he had to leave the village for the main town because farming does not yield any profit. He was dealing local produce. In 2008, he changed his business into bags. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 606,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000. Osman Malam has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy school bags - 50 pieces @ Le25,000, traveling bags - 50 pieces @ Le35,000, casual bags - 30 pieces @ Le15,000, and computer bags - 15 pieces @ Le70,000. In the future, Osman Malam hopes to sponsor his children's education. The loan will help as it is the source of income. The rainy season is a problem as it reduces sales. He is hard working. He has successfully paid the previous loan and he will make sure he repays this loan in order to acquire subsequent loans.

Manju, about 36 years old, is sitting on the extreme left with her hand raised. She hails from the Mahar community. This community does bamboo weaving work. Manju is married and resides in a small mud house with her six family members: her husband, three sons (19, 15 and 5 years old) and one daughter (10 years old). All members of this group are below the poverty line. The Mahar community to which Manju belongs, has a separate hamlet in her village.  \r\n\r\nManju runs a business weaving bamboo baskets, which is the traditional business of her community. Manju and her family do the processing work and weaving of baskets like \u201ckula, tupa, kurli, bhuga, kulei, garna, talei, parla etc.\" in different sizes. During the marriage season, there is a heavy demand for these products. They sell the products once a week in the weekly market in the nearby town. Some traders also regularly come to this village to purchase bamboo products. Manju earns a monthly profit of Rs 2,500\/- from her business. To meet the growing demand for these products, Manju wants to purchase more raw bamboo with his loan to work for a longer period without any interruption. She also wants to procure some ready-made products from other weavers. This will help her to earn some extra income to bear the regular expenses of her family in a smooth manner and to materialize her future hope of constructing a house.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Nira, Pushpa, Baidehi and Lalita who are doing similar businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1258776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To purchase raw bamboo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Mahulpada,Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T07:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T07:00:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pushpa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baidehi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":54000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":54000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T10:41:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509249,"name":"Lamrana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 38 year-old Lamrana.

is 45 years old, married, and has two children who attend school. His wife is a trader who makes 200,000 SLL in sales per day. In 1990, Mohamed established his used handbags, schoolbags, and purses business. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about 6,744,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nMohamed is requesting his third loan of 4,000,000 SLL, which he will use to purchase used handbags, school bags, and traveling bags. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 500,000 SLL. In the future, Mohamed plans to engage in the wholesale business. \r\n\r\nMohammed feels good about the loan because it helps both in his domestic and business affairs. He wants to educate his children and these loans enable him to generate more income. The shortage of goods is his major business problem. His competition is great as several people are in the same business line. He goes for quality sales to better his competitors.  \r\n\r\nMohammed began doing business when he was a boy.  He was not able to attend school because he was from a poor home.  He serves about 50 people per day mostly peddlers and ladies. His business is popular because he has customer care strategies. He has one assistant, a distant cousin, who usually goes to Freetown to buy his goods twice per month.  \r\n\r\nMohamed saved his profits to build a house and he is now looking forward to expanding his business through the help of this credit service.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1014901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase used handbags, schoolbags, and traveling bags for his retail business.

52 years old, lives with his wife and niece in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His daughter has passed away so he and his wife care for her child. He has been running a candy and sweets business since 1998 at a local market. He takes his goods from wholesale food centers. Also he has retired from the police organization and gets a pension. Due to diabetes, his left leg has been replaced with an artificial leg, but he has still difficulty walking and uses a crutch. He is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase an automobile which runs on electricity and emits less smoke. As winter comes to Mongolia, the air in Ulaanbaatar is greatly polluted and encouraging the usage of environmentally friendly cars is essential in reducing air pollution. Issuing this loan to the borrower means he can work enthusiastically and also more importantly it will contribute to environmental protection.

Her husband helps in her business and collects the forest produce from different places in the state and outside the state. After collection, Kanak processes the raw products, makes packets and supplies them to the retailers. She has also tied her business with a govt.agency called ORMAS and sold them at a lump sum for a high margin of profit. Her husband also used to go to different district and state level festivals where there is a congregation of persons to purchase her finished products by hiring a stall. Her monthly net income from the processing unit is around 12,000 INR.There is a heavy demand for her products but due to lack of funds, she could not meet the demands of the market. So with the present loan, Kanak planned to procure a bulk quantity of forest products for processing and selling in the market to earn more profit. She has a dream of providing better education to her child and constructing a house of her own in due course.  \r\n \r\nThe other three members of her group are Hasina, Gitanjali and Snehalata.

But due to the lack of money, she is unable to purchase it. \n\nTherefore, as a member of seven-person lending group, Nazi has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to cover the cost of purchasing a new tailoring machine. In this way, she will be able to complete the orders on time. \n\nNazi intends to utilize part of the profits on the betterment of her family members and on providing quality education to her

years old. She is a very caring mother and tries to provide good living conditions for her 2 children. Several years ago, Davlatoy went to Russia in order to earn a living, but was unable to find suitable work and returned home, where she found work at a farm. For the past 6 months, she has been milking cows and capably taking care of all her work responsibilities.\r\n\r\nDavlatoy would like to have a cow of her own in order to provide her children with fresh milk. Her children were very happy to hear their mother's plan. However, Davlatoy's salary is insufficient for such a purchase, and so she is requesting a loan of 3000 somoni to buy a cow. Davlatoy is a return client of IMON International, and promises to repay her loan on time. This loan will help her to improve her children's nutrition and ensure their healthy growth. Davlatoy is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1258360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gissar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.524722 68.551389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T09:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T09:00:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Davlatoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":207.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":219.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":230.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":225.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":243.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":244.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":249.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":261.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":267},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":275.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":283.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":292.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.99,"local_amount":207.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":214.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740952,"comment":null},{"amount":47.57,"local_amount":219.55,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":226.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056251,"comment":null},{"amount":50.59,"local_amount":233.47,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":241.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801948,"comment":null},{"amount":48.46,"local_amount":223.68,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":230.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510193,"comment":null},{"amount":52.74,"local_amount":243.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":251.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915478,"comment":null},{"amount":52.99,"local_amount":244.58,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":252.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693188,"comment":null},{"amount":352.66,"local_amount":1627.65,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1680.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390555993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-20T00:04:31Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509275,"name":"Tam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tam is 41 years old, and married with two children.

","en":"Nasirat is 52 years old, married, and the mother of four children.  Nasirat began a business in animal husbandry and farming, which has become the primary source of income for her family.  Nasirat began her business with 5,000 som (KGS) in 1998 and has been able to develop her business to where she now has six cows and ten sheep, which bring her a monthly profit of 10,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and cattle.  She fattens the cattle and sells them at the local cattle market.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her business, Nasirat applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy additional head of cattle.  Nasirat plans to invest in further increasing the size of her herd, and she dreams of one day giving her youngest son a good education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1258446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She is a woman of good taste and she has a kind heart.  Her husband died young, leaving her with one son.  She raised her son alone, married him off, and now she has two grandsons.  To earn an income and help his mother, Muhabatkhon's son went to work in the Russian Federation.  However, he doesn't send any money to the family.  Having not received any money from her son, Muhabatkhon decided to start her own business in processing apricot kernels.  With this goal in mind, she studied in a course called \"Achieve Success\" that is organized by the Association of Business Women and she received a graduation certificate.  She now has business-related skills.\r\n\r\nShe will buy apricot kernels, clean them with a special machine, and then sell them at the local market.  Her daughter-in-law will help her with the business.  She plans to use the income she earns to provide her grandsons and daughter-in-law with all the necessities of life.  She is requesting a loan of 4,500 somoni to buy the machine for cleaning the apricot kernels so she can start her business.  She is relying on your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1258445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is Laylanie, 35, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Paul, a seaman, and is a mother.   Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business.  She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLaylanie operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  Her income is generated by getting supplies at wholesale prices, and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLaylanie hopes to have a happy and peaceful life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and she draws strength and inspiration from studing the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1259233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T11:21:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T11:21:09Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laylanie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4106.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095363,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.98,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3421.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484513,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2738.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037023,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T12:06:47Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509475,"name":"Victoire","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\u00c9pouse d\u2019un transitaire au port, Victoire est une jeune dame \u00e2g\u00e9e de 39 ans.

Four of her children work in the Russian Federation; the youngest two are in school.  As a source of income for her family, Risalat took up animal husbandry and farming.  She started with the piece of land alloted to her by the government after the collapse of the USSR, and today her business brings in about 5,000 som (KGS) from animal husbandry and farming.  Because of Risalat's hard work, she now has four milk cows.   \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Risalat applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 135,000 som (KGS) to buy bulls and cows.

She thanks Kiva for having loaned her the money which allowed her to make these achievements. \r\n\r\nRosalba is currently getting ready for the Christmas and New Year season.  This is a time of year when her sales increase and she must have good stock available if she wants to impress her customers and draw their attention, interest and desire to buy.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Marilou is requesting a loan for 8,000 PHP, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilou faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from Gods.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives in a town near the city; it is easy for her to make her way to buy things from the market.\r\n\r\nShe is happy with Tuba Rai Metin (TRM) activities that offer loans to poor people, especially women. With the income, she hopes to make her business bigger in the future and to improve her living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1259293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy coffee, sugar, biscuits, candies, soft drinks, hard drinks, and other stock for her kiosk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TL","country":"Timor-Leste","town":"Dili","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-8.833333 125.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":243,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T15:31:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T15:31:27Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":166.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339634341,"comment":null},{"amount":166.7,"local_amount":166.7,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":166.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347190271,"comment":null},{"amount":666.65,"local_amount":666.65,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":666.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355933496,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T17:13:11Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T19:30:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509311,"name":"Erlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlyn is 42 years old, married, and has two children.\r\n\r\nErlyn works hard to provide for her children.

This way Margarita was able to give free reign to her entrepreneurial and business aptitude, because since her grandparents there's a tradition of being merchants.\r\n\r\nShe started her business selling clothing to her neighbors.  Little by little this grew and she brought together a lot of customers.  Today she sells not only clothing but every type of electrical appliance they request.\r\n\r\nIn her seven years of experience with her business she has managed to save to build her house and has helped her husband support the household.  She makes her sales on credit every day, while she makes her purchases in cash in wholesale warehouses.  She works from 7 in the morning until 7 at night every day.  Her business goal is to open a store where she can offer a variety of products to her distinguished customers and earn the market of potential buyers around her.\r\n\r\nCurrently she's applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it she'll buy clothing, footwear, and electrical appliances for the requests her customers have made.\r\n\r\nThis is the Christmas and New Year season and there's disposable income among the families who buy from her.  Thanks to getting a Kiva loan she'll make the most of this situation by having everything her customers

","en":"Bermet is 57 years old, married, and she raised four children.  With the collapse of the USSR, difficult times began for everyone, and each chose his own way to provide food for his family.  Having received her own plot from the collective farm in 1990, Bermet began a business in animal husbandry and farming with 3,000 som (KGS).  Today, Bermet has three milk cows, six sheep, and 3.42 hectares of irrigated land where she grows wheat, sainfoin, and potatoes.  Nowadays, Bermet's main priority is to provide her children with a firm foundation.\r\n\r\nWith plans to further develop her business, Bermet applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep and bulls, which she will fatten and later sell.  Bermet plans to invest the profits in further growing her business and in building a home on her own

In the Philippines, Balut is well-known egg that is sold on the sidewalk. Balut is an duck egg that has not been hatched; instead it is cooked as a boiled egg with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is a highly nutritious food that Filipinos love, especially when they feel tired as it revitalizes their energy and strength. About 450-600 Balut eggs are being boiled and sold every night. She and her husband do the boiling to lessen expenses for the vendors that will sell it. They earn 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales per day.  \r\n\r\nGertrudes is requesting a loan of PHP 22,000 that she will use to buy additional Balut eggs. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nGertrudes dreams of giving her children a good, quality education. For now, she and her husband will just continue to lean on each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future.

He returned to his motherland a sick man and he didn't have the means to pay for treatment.  Since he is married and has four children, he had to go to work in an aluminum plant.  He has been working at this plant for five years now, and his salary provides for his family.  His wife is a homemaker, so Ochildy is the only breadwinner for the family.  His only son isn't able to work and can't support his father.  Two daughters are also in school, and his oldest daughter hasn't been able to find work.\r\n\r\nYear after year Ochildy's condition worsens and none of the members of his family is able to support him.

With her previous Kiva loan, she was able to buy a greater volume of these products and she is very satisfied, because she got discounts from the providers and she added a new product: desserts, from which she has gotten really good results, because she makes it and distributes it starting Monday and collects the money on Saturdays. \r\n\r\nShe sends the following message to Kiva lenders: \"Thank you for lending me the money to move forward and I hope that you continue to support me and I will respond well to the loan.\" She is currently applying for a new Kiva loan, with which she will buy ingredients like condensed milk, chocolate, and cookies, to make desserts and buy cheese. These are the products that sell most at the end of the year, because of the Christmas and end-of-year festivities.

This is why her Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, will be successful because it will help her have additional working capital to buy in larger amounts and it comes at the best time of the year for sales: the month of December.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1259916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy footwear, blouses, jeans and articles of clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Palmar de Varela (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T18:51:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T18:51:12Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelly Johana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":52938},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":59774},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":61168},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62596},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64056},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65551},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":67080},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68645},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70247},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71886},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73564},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82495}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.62},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.78,"local_amount":52938,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":53435.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130911,"comment":null},{"amount":33.62,"local_amount":59774,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":60336.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071669,"comment":null},{"amount":34.41,"local_amount":61168,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":61743.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497882,"comment":null},{"amount":35.21,"local_amount":62596,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63184.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527695,"comment":null},{"amount":72.9,"local_amount":129607,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":130825.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928447,"comment":null},{"amount":37.73,"local_amount":67080,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":67710.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705601,"comment":null},{"amount":47.98,"local_amount":85293,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-24T08:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":86095.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817091,"comment":null},{"amount":149.29,"local_amount":265413,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":267908.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323369,"comment":null},{"amount":9.08,"local_amount":16131,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":16282.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082619,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T22:48:46Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509757,"name":"Aidee","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aidee es una mujer incansable.

is from the Vani district. He is 31 years old, single and lives with his mother who has chronic health problems and is provided with a relevant pension from the local government. Levan\u2019s source of income is a small amount of rent from his store.  As the existing income is not enough for the family, Levan decided to start a new business. In particular, he plans to finish the renovation of an additional store and rent it for a good price. Levan has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. However, his loan request was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, for they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this loan, Levan will install doors and windows in his newly built store and renovate it properly so that it satisfies the personal needs of his clients. Levan hopes his business will be profitable and this will increase his income, providing his family with enough money to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living

She is Gino's partner who works as a police officer. Together they live comfortably in her mother's house. She lives in the company of her parents, her sister, her brother-in-law and her partner. Paola's business is the sale of lubricants, for which she set up a rented locale in partnership with a friend, where the partner serves customers the majority of the time, since Paola counts on a job as a policewoman for work, and has rotating shifts.\r\n\r\nShe started this business in partnership more than 8 months ago, because of the idea and plan of her friend, sharing the profits fairly. She considers the business profitable enough because of the profits that it leaves her, since she succeeds in selling many lubricants because of the demand and the growth of the parking lot.\r\n\r\nShe likes the business because of the additional income that it generates. She is looking forward to increasing the customer service personnel, because the customers are increasing each day. She doesn't like the disorder that is caused by the minute when her locale fills up. But the financial income allows her to increase her income. On the other hand she has plans to continue and grow the business. Therefore this will be loan number 2 with the microfinance institution. Therefore she counts on this small loan in order to be able to complete her objectives. In addition to feeling comfortable with her group since she considers them to be kind and in solidarity, therefore she commits to completing the payment of her installments.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 1,000 PEN, she will invest in the purchase of lubricants in greater volume seeking low prices for her purchases. In this manner she will obtain greater profit margins and increase her stock of merchandise available for sale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1258867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy lubricants in greater volume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T19:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T19:50:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":151.46},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":151.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":165.48},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":171.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":178.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":181.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.58,"local_amount":151.46,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":155.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573047,"comment":null},{"amount":60.7,"local_amount":151.75,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":155.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122689,"comment":null},{"amount":66.2,"local_amount":165.48,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":169.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868515,"comment":null},{"amount":68.66,"local_amount":171.65,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":176.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577346,"comment":null},{"amount":71.21,"local_amount":178.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":182.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529587,"comment":null},{"amount":72.65,"local_amount":181.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":186.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974639,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T23:12:03Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
