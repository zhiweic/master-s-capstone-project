She and her husband and their only daughter moved to another district because they did not have regular jobs in their district.  Having moved to another district, they were able to find a place of employment.  However, her husband passed away after several years, and she was left without a provider.  Mosharif worked as a dishwasher at a cafeteria.  She had a small salary.  Mosharif got seriously ill because she was depressed.  She was being treated for a long time.  Despite the bad state of her health, she started her own business of buying and selling women's clothing because she had to raise her daughter.  She has since married off her daughter.  Mosharif wants to increase her working capital.  She is requesting a loan in the amount of 6000 somoni to purchase women's clothing.

There, she works alone every day, selling waffles, fried foods, melt sandwiches, coffees, and other things.  \r\n\r\nThe idea came out of the need to generate income to support household finances, since she was unemployed and job opportunities are very limited in the city.  Her drive, determination and dedication have allowed her to get ahead, and her business has already been running for 9 months, and her customers from the area recognize her for the good products she offers.\r\n\r\nShe is now applying for a loan in order to invest it in the purchase of wholesale supplies (oil, vegetables, sauces, waffle mix, butter, and other items), to upgrade the space where she is located (put in a floor to level the work table and the deep fryer), and to upgrade part of the space to open an parking lot.  \r\n\r\nThis will allow her to offer better service to her customers, because they will have the option to park their vehicles and enjoy the products on site.  Furthermore, this will improve the image of the business, opening the possibility of attracting new diners, which will allow her to increase her sales and the income she receives from her labor.\r\n\r\nThis is how Gloria wishes to continue getting ahead and in the future, realize her dream of opening a restaurant in a commercial location, that would be more profitable and guarantee economic stability to be able to enjoy a better quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75.46,"image":{"id":1460267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy wholesale supplies (oil, vegetables, sauces, waffle mix, butter, among others), to upgrade the space where she is located (put in a floor to level the work table and the deep fryer), and to upgrade part of the space to open a parking lot.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Santa Elena","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74788},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76856},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78980},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81163},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83407},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85713},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88082},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90517},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93019},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95590},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98233},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100948},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103739},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106606},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109553},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112582},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115694},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118892},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122178},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125556},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129027},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132593},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136258},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140026}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.4,"local_amount":65562,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":66611.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074789,"comment":null},{"amount":40.06,"local_amount":74192,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":75379.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009981,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T11:49:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":625818,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Hard work is an important Hmong value - everyone is expected to contribute to the family, from their childhood to old age.  Traditionally, less physically demanding jobs were reserved for elders.  Older women would cook and make clothing while young adults worked in the fields.  Now that factory-made textiles and food have replaced the homemade, Kue and many elders face a quandary.  Many of them go out and work in the backbreaking fields to try to bring value to their families and maintain their dignity, often falling into debt-slavery as a result. \n\nFor Kue, hammock weaving is a way to maintain her pride and self-worth.

He has a spouse and his wife also works growing vegetables.  His son lives at home and is currently in nursing school.  In addition to his wife and son one of Jaime\u2019s brothers also lives with them.\r\n\r\nJaime works growing basic grains (corn and beans).  He\u2019s been in this activity 16 years having learned from his parents who were always interested in his learning.  Ever since he was little he\u2019d go out to the fields where his father worked.  He decided to go into the same line of work because when he married he had no other option but to grow basic grains in order to obtain food for him and his family.\r\n\r\nAn institution has recently arrived in his community that\u2019s helping them with technical assistance to grow vegetables which is another economic activity he has.  The place he works is about 500 meters from home and he gets there on foot; his wife helps him with the work which generally goes from six in the morning to two in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking for is to make a co-payment to the institution that\u2019s making available some of the materials needed for the vegetable planting.

As a new member of the family, Parichat was eager to prove herself a worthy wife and productive partner.  Although Parichat earned an education and can read and write in Thai, she struggled at first to find a source of income; there are few job opportunities in her village or the surrounding area. \n\nTwo years ago, Parichat began learning to weave hammocks.  She caught on very quickly and her ability to read helped her understand even the most complex weaving patterns without assistance.  Now she is a prolific weaver!\n\nAlthough most couples in their tribe try to start families right away, Parichat and her husband are only recently expecting their first baby.

Alongside her aunt, she started her own small business at age 16, selling dairy products and meat, and later expanded to various retail merchandise. Gradually, she expanded her customers among her schoolmates, so she decided to work with multinational companies to offer a variety of merchandise, like makeup and women's and children's clothing, through specialized product guides.\r\n\r\nHer knowledge of the market was the first thing that she practiced with her aunt's help and it allowed her to advance. Today, her goal is to build her credit history, so this is the first time that she is applying for a loan. She developed her business by going door-to-door, making sales in cash and credit with a frequency of 20 days, and purchasing products directly from distributors' catalogs. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of improving her access to finance, Angelly has turned to a Kiva loan as her first source of financing, and with which she will purchase beauty products, women's and children's clothing, meat, fish, and cheese. With her Kiva loan, she hopes to increase her sales and number of customers. Her ultimate goal is to have her own shop where she can display products.

Thanks to Avezkul's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 bull, 4 calves, 2 sheep and also 14 hectares of land, where she annually grows clover and barley. The monthly income amounts to 6,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Avezkul requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Avezkul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1458477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Rovnoe village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avezkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T13:17:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":623736,"name":"Daisy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daisy is 37 years old and lives in Olingan, Dipolog in the Philippines.

Her profits from her business will definitely help to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nEmiliana hopes that her business will continue to flourish and dreams to have a good life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

","en":"Aygul is 44 years old, a widow and raising three children alone after her husband's death and also running her own business. Avezkul has a secondary-specialized education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide additional income for her family, Aygul is involved in animal husbandry, having started 25 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aygul's hard work, today her business contains 5 dairy cows, 1 heifer, 1 horse and also 8 hectares of land, where she annually grows clover and barley.

He is a widower, and he has children. He manages their household while operating his business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his family\u2019s everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLito operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for only one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 12, 000 loan. He will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings.\r\n\r\nLito dreams that his children will finish their studies and hopes that his business will flourish. He meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them as individual pieces. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nNerissa dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

She has a secondary education.  She currently sells sewing and knitting items at a local market and is also involved in animal husbandry and agriculture.  She started in this business 15 years ago, when she first bought livestock for 35,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work both as a retailer and as a cattle breeder, she currently owns two dairy cows and two horses.  Yrysbubu also rents two hectares of allotted land on which she cultivates potatoes and other crops every year.

La idea surgi\u00f3 de la necesidad de generar ingresos para aportar a la econom\u00eda familiar, pues estaban pasando por una dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n financiera. Aprovech\u00f3 la oportunidad de tener una escuela aleda\u00f1a a su casa y comenz\u00f3 vendiendo mecato para los estudiantes, poco a poco la demanda de sus clientes fue aumentando y el negocio se convirti\u00f3 en lo que es hoy en d\u00eda, una gran tienda de abarrotes bien surtida; all\u00ed trabaja con su esposo y juntos han podido superar todos los obst\u00e1culos y sacar adelante a sus hijos.

She is married and the mother of two children, aged 10 and 11 years old. She works as an independent merchant, running her own business. It is a general store she set up in the living room of her house. She got the idea out of necessity of generating income to support her family. They were going through a hard time financially. She took advantage of the fact that there was a primary school close to her house and she started selling pastries to the students. Little by little, her clientele grew and the business became what it is today, a great, well stocked general store. She works there with her husband and together they have been able to overcome all of the obstacles and get their children ahead. She gets her drive and her strength from her family. They have motivated her to ask for the help of the sixth credit cycle. With it, she hopes to buy merchandise wholesale (dairy products, meat products, pastries, sodas, grains and more). She will also do some improvements on her locale (painting the locale). This will allow her to improve the image of the establishment and positively change the the perception of the passers-by so that they can become potential customers. In addition, she will have more variety of products available to sell. This will help improve profits and income that she gets to continue paying for her household's basic needs.  Her only challenge, according to Mar\u00eda, is that the area where she lives is very distant from headquarters and sometimes she runs out of stock because the deliveries are late from the suppliers. Nonetheless, this doesn't stop her from continuing to fight with love and dedication. She dreams of the possibility of having a good business and turning it into a mini-supermarket where people can fill all of their needs and tastes. This will open the possibility of offering her children an excellent both in high school and college so that they can become upright people and enjoy a better quality of life.

is Zenaida, who is a resident of Batasan, Quezon CIty, Philippines. She is married, and she has children. She manages her household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family\u2019s everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nZenaida operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for only one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings.\r\n\r\nZenaida hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams of having a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of ther work every week.

She lives with her husband and two sons. Her husband works in the private sector with a very low salary that does not cover the expenses of the family. For more than 15 years the family has been extensively engaged in agribusiness. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her family members, Vardishagh is engaged in livestock, including cows and hens, and in the cultivation of beans, tomatoes, eggplant, pepper, alfalfa and several fruits (peach, apricot, fig, apple, pear and walnut). Her sons help her sell the agricultural products in the local market. \r\n\r\nAs the family's needs are growing day by day, Vardishagh wants to increase the number of livestock to effectively meet her family's needs. A loan of USD 2,500 will be a great support, enabling her to purchase two steers and some forage for the livestock. \r\n\r\nAs this is Vardishagh\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The First-Chance loan program provides loans to people who haven't had access to credit products before because they have no credit history.
