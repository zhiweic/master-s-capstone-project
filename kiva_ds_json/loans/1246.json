The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).

By buying in bulk, he will be able to offer his products at a cheaper price than his competitors, increasing his sales. \r\n\r\nSimon hopes to continue to grow and diversify his store in the future. With future profits, he dreams of one day opening up a small boutique shop and maybe even a restaurant. He thanks you all for your support!!!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2876.75,"image":{"id":1454155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

His wife is a librarian, and their son works as a security guard at the petrol station. They get monthly salaries. \r\n\r\nThe existing funds are too small, so Iuri decided to start up his own business. There is a high unemployment rate in the region, and the majority of the inhabitants are self-employed to make a living. To be able to start up his business, he is requesting a USD 4,200 loan. His loan request was approved, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. \r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions, to rural vulnerable poor people who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the amount he is asking for, Iuri will found a metal and plastics workshop.

Mar\u00eda lives with one of her sons, 33-year-old Jorge, who works as a builder, and her daughter-in-law.  They live in the Pedro Vicente Maldonado canton in the Pichincha province, Ecuador.  The Pedro Vicente Maldonado canton has many places to visit, like rivers and forests, which many tourists go to see.  When tourists come during festivals, they can see artisan exhibitions and fayres, where farming products and cattle, which are important for many inhabitants' livelihoods, are displayed.  These events have provided private businesses with the opportunity to build hotels, hostels, and offer various services for tourists.  However the main business in this town is agriculture and cattle raising.  Every year this work increases the town's economic output, even though there is little technology in the area.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda makes a living doing various types of work, within the farming sector - she milks cows, harvests cocoa, and raises chickens.  Even though Mar\u00eda had a porblem with her leg a few years ago, stopping her from working, she has continued to raise and fatten up chickens.  She learned this trade from a very young age, from her parents who worked in this same area.  Mar\u00eda invests some ten hours of her day in looking after the animals.  Particularly when they are babies, the chickens need a lot of care, as they are sensitive to illnesses.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda dreams of having a farm raising chickens and pigs.  To start on the path towards this dream, she will buy more chickens, and increase the size of her sheds.  In order to do this, Mar\u00eda needs a loan.  She will increase her income to pay basic costs, and will also save up to look after her health in her old age.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":164.15,"image":{"id":1457914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens and extend the sheds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pedro Vicente Maldonado","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-10-26T12:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-25T12:00:04Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Piedad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1142.73,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":87.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":91.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":94.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":97.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":103.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":105.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":107.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.09,"local_amount":75.61,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":76.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059949,"comment":null},{"amount":88.06,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995280,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-26T14:52:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":624365,"name":"Unidos Para El Progreso Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cUNIDOS PARA EL PROGRESO\u201d est\u00e1 conformada por 06 socias dedicas a prestar servicios y a las diversas actividades del comercio.

With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is very fortunate to live in one of the most touristic places of the Canton, known as the Mindo Parrish, which is visited by many foreigners who come to enjoy the beautiful scenery, ranches, waterfalls, and other places.\r\n\r\nShe is a single mother who lives in a humble home with her 3 children; the oldest is 11 and the youngest is 5. They go to school in the area. Rosario comes from a family with few economic resources. Her parents only sent her to primary school due to the financial situation, which is still a challenge. She also had a problem with one of her lungs and couldn't work for 15 days.\r\n\r\nBecause she is the head of household, she doesn't have a lot of free time. Apart from her chicken production business, she also works in the kitchen of a restaurant nearby. She works an average of 10 hours a day. However, whenever she can, she takes advantage of her free time to be with her children.\r\n\r\nShe started her chicken business on her own because the area has several restaurants and it is a popular place. She started with 10 chickens and sold them. This made her realize that it was a profitable business and that there weren't many expenses because she could deliver them throughout her own Parrish.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of the business is taking care of the baby chicks. She has to watch them carefully and make sure that they don't get sick. If they do get sick, she has to care for them and give them special treatment for a fast recovery.\r\n\r\nRosario has many dreams, including improving and expanding her small home and growing her business.

Because of a lack of economic resources, they haven't been able to have electricity in their home. But, with the payment facilities offered by FUSAI, she accessed a loan from the Foundation and will use the money to get the house wired and connected to the electricity supply.

He is married and lives with his wife, two school-age children and retired parents. They are running an agricultural business and grow maize and grapes on the family-owned plot of land. Also, Gia breeds a dairy cow, three calves, a pig and six bee-hives with bee colonies. The income from the agricultural activities is modest and Gia decided to start a trading business with a loan. But the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Gia\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as he doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. He received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Startup Program gives vulnerable poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of $2000, he will purchase second-hand shoes at wholesale prices and sell them from a stall located at the local fair market.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

It\u2019s also known for having a very important ethic group in the Tsachila community, representative of Ecuador.  Erlinda was previously engaged and had a son who is now 8 years old.  The engagement failed because her partner did not support her financially and also because he would not allow her to start any businesses to help get the family ahead.  She met Julio five years ago and he is a very responsible man with whom she now lives and they have a four year old daughter together.\r\n\r\nThey live in a rented home.  Her oldest son attends a school that is a bit far away and he travels by bus every day.  Her daughter stays home with her.  Her husband is a hardworking and responsible gentleman who has been doing farm work for hire for the past eight years, but his income is not enough to cover the household expenses.  For this reason, Erlinda decided to start a clothing sales and cosmetic business three years ago.  She works it 3-4 hours a day, visiting her customers door to door, and spends the rest of the day caring for her family.\r\n\r\nNow both work to sustain the household and work every day to get ahead and achieve one of their dreams of having a shop so that they can have a better income and be able to buy a house.  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has provided them with the opportunity to increase their income, by providing a small loan to buy merchandise.

posee hace aproximadamente 2 a\u00f1os y con el que complementa los ingresos para llevar el sustento a su familia y a su peque\u00f1o hijo de 1 a\u00f1o de edad. Su empuje, perseverancia y las ganas de salir adelante, lo impulsan para buscar alternativas que apoyen su proceso de crecimiento, por esta raz\u00f3n solicita el cr\u00e9dito, con el cual pagar\u00e1 una deuda a sus proveedores y cancelar el saldo de un cr\u00e9dito que tiene vigente; esto le permitir\u00e1 tener capital disponible para enfrentar su principal desaf\u00edo que es el manejo de cartera, pues sus clientes pagan a 3 meses, pero los gastos de su microempresa no dan espera, llegan cada mes, afectando la rentabilidad de su negocio.

","en":"Carlos, 30, has spent part of his productive life working as an employee on a flower farm in the region where he lives; he works there every day from 6am until 2pm.  In addition, he also cares for his own hortense flower crop that he\u2019s had for about two years and that produces extra income for him to support his family and one-year-old son.\r\n\r\nHis drive, perseverance and wish to succeed impel him to seek alternatives that will support his growth process and this is why he\u2019s asking for the loan that he\u2019ll use to pay off a debt he has with suppliers and to pay off another pending loan.  This will make it possible for him to have cash on hand to face his main challenge which is managing his client portfolio because they pay him every three months but his micro-business has expenses that don\u2019t wait, they arrive monthly affecting his business\u2019 bottom line.\r\n\r\nCarlos wants to continue striving to move his work forward once more and be able to access the possibility of expanding his crops, acquiring more customers and offering employment opportunities.  In this way, he\u2019ll be more profitable and generate higher income to ensure his family\u2019s improved well-being and quality of

He currently has 4 children attending school in different grades, including high school, 9th grade, 7th grade, and 5th grade.  His other children are already grown, but they continue to live in his house.  One of them works as a farmer and has other economic activities.  Alfredo's wife devotes herself to the household chores.  They are a very united family, because each of them contributes to put food on the table and cover other family expenses.  \r\n\r\nAlfredo is a mason by profession; he has about 20 years of experience in this activity, and this is how he provides for his family.  One of the things that motivated him in this work was that as a child his dad, who was a mason, would take him to work, and so he learned the trade rapidly and on the job. He was seeing that this was an activity where one could earn money, and so decided to learn this trade very well so that now he is one of the best in the area where he lives.  In addition, he has also always worked in agriculture, because this has been another source of income for him.  For a long time he had 20 cows, from which he obtained income for his family, but because of some problems he had to get rid of them.  Alfredo has involved his children in his masonry work; they are learning how to do the same work that he does.\r\n\r\nAlfredo will use this loan to buy dairy cows, specifically, he will buy one dairy cow to start producing as he did before.  With this, he will be able to obtain another source of income for his family, and thereby improve his children's living conditions as they get an education.
