Nana requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, without any success. Her loan request was rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. She has an empty space in her village and plans to open a grocery shop there. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-starts up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Nana requested a loan for purchasing stocks of groceries which will help her to start her grocery store. She will reinvest the profits into the shop and will keep adding more products.

is 34-year-old Margarette. She is married and has four children ages five, six and fourteen. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her to assist with the house chores.  \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Margarette established her textiles business. She began her business because she wanted to assist her husband in taking care of the home. Her business is located in the city center and her main customers are adults. \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and ten hours a day, Margarette earns about SLL 2,500,000 every month from this business.

is from Aurora Zamboanga del Sur, and father of two children. He is 51 years old. He is happily married and his wife is a nurse. He has a flower farm to earn a living. He decided to engage in this business to help his wife to earn an income for the family needs and of course for the education of the children. His wife is not yet a regular employee and does not earn so much. He has been in this business for about 5 years and earns an income of approximately PHP 8,250 a month.\n\nJerry was very happy hearing the name of GATA DAKU MPC when someone introduced them to him.

She is married to Rey, her business partner and is the mother to their children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand-in-hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nMarifi owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and maintain her jeepney. Marifi dreams to expand her business and hopes to give her children a good education and a good life.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is 38-year-old Abdul. He is married and has three children, aged 14, 12, and 5 years. Two of them are school-going children. He has one additional dependent, who lives with him because she is attending school.\n\nIn 2003, Abdul established his clothing business. He began his business because he dropped out of school, due to a lack of financial support. His uncle advised Abdul to join him in his business, because it was the only way he could help him. He had no alternative but to join his uncle, and trade with him from place to place. He worked with his uncle until years later, when he started his own business. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about SLL 925,000 every month from this business.\n\nAbdul would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,500,000.

is 27-year-old Bassie.  She is married and has four children, aged 8, 5, 3, and 1 year. Two of the children are school-going children.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bassie established her general store business, selling items like peak milk, mayonnaise, sardine, sweets, batteries, biscuits, cigarettes, and soap. She began her business because she did not attend school, her parents being people who did not see value in educating a girl child.  She used to assist her mother in business.  After she got married, her husband opened a shop for her to run.  Working 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, she earns about SLL 2,158,000 every month from this business.\r\n\r\nBassie would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Bassie requires a loan in order to buy inventory, like Ovaltine, powered milk, baby food, sweets, cigarettes, toilet paper, soap, and batteries.

She also earns additional income from the rental houses owned by the family. The area has a large population, most of whom work on the island and return to the mainland in the evenings, with little time to prepare meals. \r\n\r\nAsha learned about Milango through advertisements. She joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations. Her main challenges are price fluctuations. Asha is applying for a loan of 43,200 Kenya shillings to buy retail and food stock such as rice, cereals, wheat flour, cooking oil, etc. Asha will use the extra income from the loan for savings, to improve her family's living standard and to pay school fees for her children. She looks forward to owning a large business space and a wholesale shop in the

Houston, Texas, Angela owns Angela's Bridal Designs Tailoring & Alterations, where she works with all fabrics specializing in custom-cut bridal wear, dance costumes, embellishments, quilts and then some.\r\n\r\nWith more than 30 years of experience, Angela's next step is to create a line of wedding veils; she already has permission to vend at a local wedding shop where she offers her services. She is positive that once the veil material arrives, the demand will follow and she'll be able to hire the list of people waiting for a job with her, that without the loan, she would not be able to do.\r\n\r\nWhen Angela attended school to become a designer, she knew to sew and quickly learned to make patters. \"God gives you a gift, and that's very important. We have that; my daughter and I have that. We don't say no to anything,\" she says. \"We do a lot of stuff here,\" she says. \"It's the only way to keep in business. I do a lot of custom-made pants, shirts, tuxedos and suits.\" You can view Angela's full list of services on her website www.angielocustoms.com\/.\r\n\r\nShe's helped launch several companies through her work: one man employed Angela to create and sew designs for his business of selling custom-designed soft computer cases; that man is now in China shopping for a large factory to keep up with his orders. Another man requested Angela create a prototype of his detachable vinyl-type house invention, which allows clean air to flow in while workers in factories and refineries can work without the dangers of harmful fumes. Currently, Angela helps a lady develop her fashion line of dresses by sewing.\r\n\r\nHowever, her life hasn't always been this easy. In her home country, Angela was married by 18 years old to a jealous man, who never let her leave home, but when he left to work, she walked to stores and purchased small amounts of materials and paints. To escape her life, she painted, designed baptism, other formal dresses and sold them to local businesses where people started to order multiples, she says. \"I love what I'm doing,\" Angela says. \"It's my life.\"\r\n\r\nThe business grew, Angela hired an employee and purchased two sewing machines, but it wasn't enough; the business continued growing. \"I decided to open my business. I had 20 people working in morning and another 20 working at night. That was very successful; my husband decided to help and stay home, until the divorce.\"\r\n\r\nAfraid her jealous, and now angry, ex-husband would try to find her, Angela fled the country to Texas where she began working with a designer, \"but she didn't pay me sometimes because I didn't have papers,\" she says. Shortly after, Angela went to work for herself.\r\n\r\nAngela says her business is stable and receives many referrals but she needed a loan to purchase materials to make bridal veils. She went to her bank and they recommended her to Accion Texas Inc. for a loan. She also plans to create dance costumes and sell them to local dance studios.\r\n\r\nAn established business woman, she reinstated her business by working from home and expanded to her current location: a large office on a busy corner in Houston. Since the beginning of her business, Angela says: \"Now, we receive orders for people we don't even see in Florida, North Carolina, from everywhere; they like what we do.\"

This is the biggest challenge that they are facing, and that is why they have come to Kiva for their first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which they will buy sauces, meat, and bread products to have enough supplies to make products for their potential customers. \r\n\r\nTheir dream is to buy their own house to be able to give their family their own roof to live under peacefully.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1301436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sauces, meat, and bread products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-02-25T16:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-27T16:10:12Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dirianis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":830000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":74653},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":76395},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78178},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80002},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":81869},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83779},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":85734},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87734},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89781},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.72,"local_amount":74653,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":77092.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498029,"comment":null},{"amount":43.72,"local_amount":76395,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":78891.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527845,"comment":null},{"amount":44.74,"local_amount":78178,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":80732.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928590,"comment":null},{"amount":45.79,"local_amount":80002,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":82616.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705741,"comment":null},{"amount":46.85,"local_amount":81869,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-25T08:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84544.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968031,"comment":null},{"amount":47.95,"local_amount":83779,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":86516.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817228,"comment":null},{"amount":49.06,"local_amount":85734,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":88535.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323500,"comment":null},{"amount":50.21,"local_amount":87734,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":90600.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082740,"comment":null},{"amount":51.38,"local_amount":89781,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":92714.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062118,"comment":null},{"amount":52.58,"local_amount":91875,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":94877.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731814,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-27T01:18:55Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531699,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al sur de la ciudad de Barranquilla y se dedica a la actividad comercial;

To be able to buy the refrigerator, he took a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq.   \r\n\r\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor, thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity.

She lives with her parents. \r\n\r\nIn search of additional sources of income for her family, Azikul started her own animal husbandry business in 1968 with an initial investment of 5,000 som. Thanks to persistent work Azikul now has two cows, two bulls, four calves, and two horses on her farm. Her monthly income from diary and meat products as well as the resale of cattle is about 35,000 som. \r\n\r\nWith long-term business development in mind, Azikul turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 som to purchase four bulls. She plans to use the additional income to invest in increasing her head of cattle.

","en":"Gulbara is 53 years old and she has raised one son.  By nature, she is a quiet and very positive woman.  She has been involved in animal husbandry since 1998 and started in this business with an initial capital of 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, she now owns one cow, 30 sheep and two horses.  She makes close to 15,000 som (KGS) a month from the sale of milk and dairy products.\n\nIn order to further develop her business, Gulbara has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy a dairy cow and small livestock, which will allow her to increase her milk yield.

She is 28 years old, married and a mother of two children. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Khanda is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nKhanda has five years' experience with the small, home-based sewing and tailoring activity. She makes custom-ordered small, fabric household items and dresses for women and children. She would like to improve her work conditions and renovate her work area. She hopes that the nicer atmosphere will make the ordering experience for her customers a little more pleasent, and will also allow her to have a nice place to work on her orders. To be able to pay for the renovation work, she took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Presently, these pillows and quilts are an integral part of traditional wedding ceremonies.  For the first few years of her work, Ibadat worked from home, but recently, she's rented a building and hired laborers.  With the goal of further developing her business, Ibadat has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy a new car since it is difficult to transport materials and make deliveries of the finished products.

As a means of earning income for her family, she raises cattle and grows crops. She started this business 11 years ago with a sum of 5,000 Kyrgyzstan Som.

In addition, she works 0.55 hectares of irrigated land. For the purpose of further developing her business, Kamiila has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 Som to buy 3 heifers to fatten and re-sell in the future.

She lives with her husband in Koutiala City. She did not have the chance to be educated, and so she became interested in commerce at an early age. She learned about commerce from her mom. After having run several revenue-generating businesses, she has now opted for selling peanuts, peanut butter, soaps, cakes, etc. \r\n\r\nTo increase her business capital, so as to expand her business, Assitan turned toward the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso seven years ago. She has taken out four loan from an association (solidarity loans), all properly repaid, and she is now on her 9th individual loan, of which the preceding eight were indeed paid back. \r\n\r\nWith this financing, she intends to purchase 6 sacks of peanuts from Koutiala grain and grocery suppliers. Accepting cash and sometimes credit, she makes her sales out of her home to a customer base composed generally of women. \r\n\r\nWith this financing, she is planning on a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that she envisions using for repaying Soro the interest and helping to improve her family's living conditions. For the future, Assitan plans on expanding her business in other directions. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":838.64,"image":{"id":1301260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase sacks of peanuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-02-25T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-27T17:00:05Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":46344.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636470,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46344.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029954,"comment":null},{"amount":93.19,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":46344.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819461,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":46344.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678363,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":46344.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924036,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":46344.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207294,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":46344.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419971967,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":46344.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624636,"comment":null},{"amount":93.19,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":46344.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850674,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T02:54:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525807,"name":"Lindita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lindita is a 25-year-old married Roma mother of a one-year-old child and is expecting her second one soon.

","en":"Najmiddin is 46 years old, married, and has three children.  He's a man with many positive qualities.  He's a very kind and responsible person.  When he was a child, he dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur.  Now that he's grown, he buys and sells men's clothing and footwear and he enjoys this work very much.  Najmiddin imports clothing to his village from another city and sells them in his store.  His wife does not have a job outside of the home and focuses on raising their children.  \n\nThis business is the sole source of income for the family.  For this reason, Najmiddin is trying to develop his business and save money for his children's future.  Since he does not have enough money to buy a new assortment of men's clothing, on the advice of his friends, he turned MDO Arvand for a loan.  From loan proceeds Najmiddin Nachmiddin wants to buy a new range of men's clothing and shoes.  He expresses his gratitude to MDO Arvand and Kiva for financial

He is married and has two children. Sherali's wife works in a high school, and in her spare time from work she still cares for her husband's parents since they are very elderly pensioners. \n\nSherali on his own is engaged in selling food products. These kinds of activities started three years ago. Sherali buys products in a nearby town and sells them in his village. Unfortunately, he was not able to get his own shop, but in the future he plans to purchase one. He is saving money for this.

Yasser is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. \r\n\r\nFATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see in fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. \r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim

He breeds cows and cattle and sells milk and milk products, as well as cattle for meat purposes to local butchers.  There are about eight head in his herd.  Sakit has five years of experience in this field, and the reason which pushed him to start his own business was a very low pension.\r\n\r\nSakit usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, and resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar. Milk and yoghurt he sells to the neighbors. Milk and meat selling brings an income of 400 AZN per month. \r\n\r\nMilk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce.

She is married to Henry, a driver, and is a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDonata operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm-sized ones to the much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Donata's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Donata continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nDonata hopes to expand her business and have more products to sell. She dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up every week with her *co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1300934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to pay for fabric, cloth, thread and other materials needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-02-25T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-27T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Donata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2715.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037440,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2714.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781960,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3394.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488848,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1357.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894476,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-25T20:05:11Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531313,"name":"Virgendina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virgendina works hard to support her family.

Accepting cash or credit, she makes her sales to a customer base composed of men and women at the big market in Koutiala.\r\n\r\nShe plans on making an average profit of 100,000 francs CFA per month.

","en":"Julia is 53 years old and was born in a small part of the city of Loja.  Her family was of limited financial resources so they were only able to pay for her to complete elementary school and receive a basic education.  She married Jose when she was very young.  He\u2019s now 63 years old and a farmer.  They have five children and have provided them with everything they needed so that they could become independent and work on their own.  She currently lives with her husband in the Santo Domingo settlement of the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province.  Santo Domingo is located along the mountain and coastal regions of Ecuador, and is in a commercially strategic zone, very convenient for large and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nJulia has been a housewife since she married and has also been helping her husband work on the crops.  However nine years ago she saw that the household needs had increased greatly when she was diagnosed with uterine cancer and she had to cover various costs for this treatment.  It would have been easy for Julia to give up and use her illness as a reason to quit working, however this woman has not slowed down despite her age and illness.  Each day she goes out to walk along the streets of her city and offer casual clothing, table cloths, and curtains to her customers and also to collect on bills from previous sales.  Julia needs to grow her business and needs more merchandise.  This will help her increase her income and be able to cover the cost of her lab fees, medicine, and special food that her cancer treatment requires.  Julia needs this loan to be able to buy clothing and products.  Thanks to some of her friends\u2019 recommendations Julia has approached Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, who aside from the speed and trust, have they have made this loan possible very easily.  This is her first loan and she expects to be on time with her payments.  She is grateful to Kiva, who has made this loan possible.

","en":"Leonel is a man who was born in the warm part of Ecuador, in the town of Los Bancos, where he spent his childhood and, thanks to the effort of his parents, was able to complete primary school. He worked with his parents since he was very young, and he married, forming a household with two children, who are now attending a public school. With time, things did not go as he hoped, and he made the decision to separate from his wife. It was a very hard time for him and his family. In any case, it was overcome, and Leonel continued working so that his children would not lack for anything. Now Leonel lives in the Rio Verde parish, a historic part of Santo Domingo, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a province of Ecuador that in recent years has had high sustained growth. Its capital is a city whose most attractive and eye-catching features are its delicious fruits and the gastronomy that is offered there. It also has considerable commerce, since it has become a terrestrial \"port\" for commercial exchange between the mountain and coastal regions of the country. In addition, it has various tourist attractions, which, accompanied by its warm climate, are much visited by national and foreign tourists. It is for this reason that the majority of its inhabitants have undertaken some commercial activity or service for local residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nLeonel had relatives who had always worked in the wholesale distribution of rice to the stores, micro-markets, and warehouses both within and outside of the city. Leonel continued their example and has been working in this business for five years. He goes through the city and its outskirts offering his product and taking orders from his frequent customers. In the space in his rented house that he designated for his business, Leonel receives the product by the hundredweight and prepares it to go out through the city delivering it and also charging the customers. Leonel dreams of having his own house where he could build a warehouse for rice and some additional foodstuffs and thus be able to grow and give an example to other people. To achieve this dream, Leonel has proposed increasing his sales and creating some savings with the extra money that he receives.

He is married and has four children. He and his family live in the mountains. His wife is a housewife, and she raises the children. As they live in the mountains, they can only work with livestock breeding. \r\n\r\nHudoiberdi has been breeding livestock for many years already, and is very satisfied with this, because he gets a good income form this type of business. Every month he purchases livestock at the livestock market and fattens them for some time, before selling them at a higher price. \r\n\r\nSince childhood, Hudoiberdi's family had financial problems, and he was not able to study, and lived in bad conditions. Therefore, he dreams of his children living in prosperity, studying at the university, working with their profession of choice and not knowing hunger. In order to achieve all this he works very hard. \r\n\r\nHudoiberdi would like to purchase livestock and increase the number of cattle. For this he turned to the organization \"Arvand\" to receive a loan. He hopes that he gets the loan and can develop his business.

After school he started working and helped his parents, as he was the eldest son in the family. Mukim worked for food, but he did not forget about his moral values. He always read books and was very interested in medicine. \r\n\r\nThe years went by and currently Mukim has a family. He has a loving wife and three children. His wife does not work, she raises the children. Mukim, as a responsible family man, a caring father and a good husband, works hard so that his family is not in need and his children grow up literate. He works two shifts at the hospital as a medical assistant. He works and struggles so that his children don't have as hard a childhood as himself. He wants them to study and get an education. \r\n\r\nMukim tries to create good living conditions and always supports his family morally and materially. To realize his future plan, which is to renovate their apartment, he is in need of additional resources. He would like to refresh their living rooms and renew their bathroom by spring. To do this, he decided to take a loan and equip his house. He turned to \"MDO Arvand\" and hopes for help and support from the

His father was left behind in Cambodia. When he was 20 years old, Patrick came to the U.S. to look for his father because he believed his father lived with his uncle in Seattle. Unfortunately, his father wasn\u2019t here. \r\n\r\nPatrick was strong enough to get through and decided to restart his life in the U.S. He learned English, but unfortunately wasn\u2019t able to attend college.  He found a job in the telecommunications industry, promoting, selling, and servicing wireless phone services. Then he became an independent contractor, doing installations and sales for Verizon FIOS with the hope of creating jobs for his fellow immigrants. After four years of hard work for Verizon, he became its top salesperson.\r\n\r\nIn early 2012, Patrick and his wife decided to start their own company to provide marketing services for telecommunication companies. Verizon became the company\u2019s first major customer by contracting with Patrick\u2019s company to handle referrals of prospective customers throughout the United States.  Patrick\u2019s company\u2019s job is to follow up and sign up the customers with services from Verizon. In this past year, the company has hired seven employees and has started to make a profit. \r\n\r\nIn late 2012, as his business grew so fast, Patrick wanted to expand his business and hire more staff. However, with his limited credit score and short business history, he wasn\u2019t able to get the loan from the bank. One day, he heard about PACE from his friend. \r\n\r\nWith a loan of $10,000 from PACE, Patrick can add three work stations equipped with computers, printers, and Internet access; also upgrade the phone system and hire at least three more staff.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2539.51,"image":{"id":1299005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call

Pues ella sola es quien lleva el sustento a su casa y provee para las necesidades de su hijo y el mantenimiento y servicios b\u00e1sicos de la casa. Esta humilde mujer vive con su hijo en la parroquia Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n en Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Adem\u00e1s la visita de turistas nacionales y extranjeros aporta al fortalecimiento de las actividades de los emprendedores que desde hace algunos a\u00f1os han establecido sus negocios alrededor de toda la ciudad. Esta ciudad que es la tercera m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nDesde hace 25 a\u00f1os, Annie ejerci\u00f3 por cuenta propia su oficio de costura, confeccionando todo tipo de ropa casual y formal, oficio que hered\u00f3 de algunos familiares. Ella atiende a sus clientes en su casa, en donde ya muchos moradores de la zona la recomiendan por la responsabilidad y buen trabajo que realiza con la ropa. Trabaja todo el d\u00eda, sentada en su m\u00e1quina de coser elaborando trajes a la medida de sus clientes. Para Annie es importante un crecimiento de su negocio para que su hijo herede el esp\u00edritu emprendedor que seguramente le servir\u00e1 de mucho en el futuro. Como un paso al mejoramiento del negocio, ella requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual piensa comprar una m\u00e1quina de coser que servir\u00eda para la elaboraci\u00f3n de disfraces que son muy demandados en ciertas \u00e9pocas del a\u00f1o, adem\u00e1s de las telas e insumos necesarios. Con esta compra, los ingresos de Annie incrementar\u00e1n y ella podr\u00e1 mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su hijo para que \u00e9ste obtenga el t\u00edtulo profesional que ella no tuvo la oportunidad de conseguir. Cuando se le cont\u00f3 sobre la intermediaci\u00f3n de Kiva para financiar sus sue\u00f1os, Annie se sinti\u00f3 muy emocionada y dijo que agradece a cada persona que alrededor del mundo dedica tiempo y dinero a la realizaci\u00f3n de proyectos de emprendedores como ella que en muchas ocasiones se les dificulta tanto la obtenci\u00f3n de cr\u00e9ditos en el sector financiero. ","en":"Annie is a 56 year old woman.  Her life has been an example of hard work and effort.  She completed high school in her hometown of Quevedo and then moved in order to train herself in styling and sewing clothes.  She is unmarried and has one son who has become her motivation for doing her best job each day.  She alone is the one who supports her household, provides for her son\u2019s needs, and pays for the home\u2019s maintenance and utilities.  This humble woman lives with her son in the Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n parish in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas.  Commerce is very active here and this area has become a land port for trade between the mountains and the coast of Ecuador.  In addition, the visits of domestic and foreign tourists contribute to the strengthening of the activities of entrepreneurs that have established their businesses all around the city in recent years.  This city is the third most populous in the region and also contributes to activities such as agriculture, livestock breeding, fishing, and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nFor 25 years, Annie has been working as a self-employed seamstress. She inherited the trade from her family and makes all styles of casual and formal clothing.  She serves her clients in her home and many area residents recommend her because she is responsible and does a good job on the clothing.   She works all day, and sits at her sewing machine fashioning custom-made suits for her customers. For Annie, the growth of her business is important because she wants her son to inherit the entrepreneurial spirit that will surely serve him well in the future.  As a step toward improving her business, she is requesting a loan to purchase a sewing machine, fabric, and materials, which will help her make costumes that are in high demand at certain times of the year.

Currently, several malfunctions have developed with his car. \r\n\r\nTolibjon had savings for car repairs, but he had to pay for his daughter's education.

His hope is that his children study and prepare themselves professionally.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1301626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy three livestock (cows)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T01:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T01:00:05Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T16:25:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531241,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La cliente vive en Guayaquil, tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad.

Rasulov. She is 48 years old, and has three children \u2014 two sons and one daughter. Sadly Markhabo's husband died several years ago, and she has been forced to become both mother and father to her children. Her sons have gone to Russia for work, and they try to send her as much money as possible. For several years, Markhabo has been working raising and fattening cattle. She buys young calves, fattens them, and then sells them for meat. Since she no longer bears the heavy responsibility of looking after the children, she has gotten a second job working the night shift in a home for the disabled. Her daughter helps her with raising the cattle. Things are very difficult for Markhabo without her husband, but she lives for the sake of her children and doesn't lose heart. Soon her sons will come home from abroad and she will marry them off, and has saved up money for this. Markhabo has decided to take out a loan and buy a cow to expand her business. Hopefully she will receive financial support at Arvand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1297674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Winny replied 'It will  boost family income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Winny owns the following: cow, poultry and motorcycle, but does not own pig, pump, bicycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net and running water but does not have electricity, solar power, a sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":184.31,"image":{"id":1301006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Winny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1475.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1514.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1554.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1595.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1638.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1681.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1725.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1771.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1818.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1918.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.93,"local_amount":2954.4,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3233.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516769,"comment":null},{"amount":19.37,"local_amount":1549.43,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1695.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960374,"comment":null},{"amount":19.5,"local_amount":1560.38,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1707.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820047,"comment":null},{"amount":40.57,"local_amount":3245.6,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3551.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980692,"comment":null},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":5434.84,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5947.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529309,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-26T12:04:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531341,"name":"Vivian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vivian, a 48-year-old married mother of two, works very hard to provide for them.

She is divorced and lives with her family. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Hanah is one of the many Iraqi women who are working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has two years experience with the small, home-based sewing and tailoring business activity, which she would now like to improve. She would like to be able to offer a greater variety of creative options for her customers who order dresses and small fabric household items from her and to do so she would like to purchase an embroidery\/pattern machine. To be able to buy the new machine, she took a small loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.
