In 2007, after learning how to run a business from her mother, she opened a general store where she now works every day, from morning to night. Her main business challenge is a lack of capital with which to operate and stock her store. Joyah is requesting a loan to buy clothing and palm oil to sell to her customers. She hopes that the extra income she earns from this this loan will allow her to educate her children and start a savings account. In the future, Joyah hope to open a big clothing store.

She began her business because she needed to raise income for the development of the home. She works at the business every day from morning to 11:00 p.m. at night.  She says that at present she is faced with insufficient capital to run the business. \r\n\r\nHannah requires a loan in order to expand her shop by purchasing bundled water, soft drinks, and bagged sugar.

is 59 years old, and she is from a small village in the Martvili district. She lives with her parents, who are provided with a retirement pension. \r\n\r\nMadona requested loans from local financial institutions several times in order to start a family business, but she met with no success. Her loan request was rejected every time because of her low income and the family's poor living conditions. Currently, the family's only source of income is their agricultural business. Specifically, Madona has a cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. Madona sells the cheese locally in an open market at a good price. This activity provides hardly enough food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMadona's loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing credit with soft conditions for start-up and restart-up businesses to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. Madona requested a loan from Credo to purchase an additional milk cow. After purchasing the cow, she will be able to increase her cheese production, which will significantly increase the family's income and improve their living

He has already sold a large part of his harvest, but he needs basic supplies to be able to continue with his work. It is for this reason that he approached INTEGRAL about taking out a loan. He will use the loan to buy seeds, organic and chemical fertilizers, pesticides and other supplies. He hopes that his request for help is heard so that soon he will be able to take advantage of this opportunity to continue providing his family with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1241568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and other supplies.

It has been a profitable project and the only source of income to the family, but also it needs more support to cover some of the costs.\r\nMahdiya is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing needed stocks of basic groceries that customers often request such as rice, canned and frozen food and dairy products. This will increase sales and increase the family's income and ensure better living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":667.52,"image":{"id":1241299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Mikhei is very hard-working man, with a rich experience in his work.\r\n\r\nHe requested a loan to purchase boxes for apples, and cover the costs related to harvesting apples. Mikheil will pay for workers and will be able to keep the apples in boxes in proper time. This will make sure not to rot the products during winter season. Mikheil will sell apples after several months, when the price and demand are higher and this will significantly increase the family income. The increased profit will be used for improvement the family living

With this investment, she hopes to improve her store and have more customers, so that she can increase her income. \r\n\r\nNilda is very thankful to the Kiva investors, knowing that they will support her in her business.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her inventory. \r\n\r\nTeresita hopes to help her grandchildren finish college and dreams that her business will continue to grow. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

All four active women entrepreneurs in this group belong to Bhawanipatna town in the Kalahandi district in Odisha, India. Kalahandi district is a very poor region of the country with poverty and underdevelopment. Rashmirani, standing second from the right with a red-colored sari in the photo, is one of the members of this group. She is 26 years of age and lives with her husband, her four-year-old son, father and mother-in-law. \r\n\r\nRashmirani has been running a fabrication workshop for the last 13 years in a temporary shed with the active participation of her husband, who looks after all activities of the business. She has engaged three skilled workers in her fabrication works @ 3,000 INR each per month. She manufactures grills, shutters, windows, doors and other iron products per the orders of the customers. Her monthly net income from the fabrication work is around 5,000 to 6,000 INR. In her opinion, her present income is insufficient to manage the fabrication as well as household expenses. Her husband purchases iron materials from the local market regularly as needed. \r\n\r\nWith the present loan, she is planning to purchase iron rods, angles, and iron sheets in bulk to save the unnecessary expenses incurred due to price fluctuation of the materials and transportation. With this, she will earn some extra income for her family. Rashmirani has a dream of providing a better education for her child and constructing a good workshop for her fabrication unit in the near future. Also, she has a big hope of constructing a house of her own in due course.  \r\n \r\nThe other three members of her group are Gitanjali, Niharika and Kuni who are running a vegetable farm, an electrical shop and a shoe business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1241347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To purchase iron rods, angles, and iron sheets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhawanipatna,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T05:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T05:30:11Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gitanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niharika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rashmirani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":144000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":144000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-24T08:19:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":499495,"name":"Enrique","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seventeen years ago, Enrique began his career as a truck driver.

A graduate from The University of Texas at San Antonio, Shannon says, \u201cMy father and I felt confident that we would be successful.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn May 2012, Shannon and his parents began the business, offering reduced rates and \u201cincreased quality care.\u201d  He says because they have a small number of clients and one van, he and his family can offer more personalized customer service. \r\n\r\nValet Transportation doesn\u2019t have a website or social media page but runs completely off word of mouth and direct marketing. \u201cWe have an agreement with nursing homes and an emergency transportation business which calls us when they have overflow,\u201d Shannon says. \r\n\r\nA client can pay $200 to $300 for a stretcher van, which is how most emergency vehicles work, since they may not be equipped with wheelchair harnesses or ramps.  His company charges $80 round-trip in an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) certified van equipped with wheelchair necessities.\r\n\r\nShannon found out about Accion Texas Inc. six years ago during a UTSA seminar about how to generate operating income. \u201cI never deleted that number from my phone,\u201d Shannon says. The loan will repair the van and be used as cash flow. \u201cWe bill the nursing homes and they take 30-90 days to get to us,\u201d Shannon says. \u201cOur invoices show we make a monthly profit, but we don\u2019t see it until they pay.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe loan eased the family\u2019s financial worries and freed them to complete preventive maintenance. Shannon says, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been able to obtain more clients without these procedures. We would have had to wait two to three months before making that money ourselves.\u201d \r\n\r\nValet Transportation also provides services to grocery stores, clinics, pharmacies and any other places their clients need to go. \u201cOur service is a lot cheaper than calling a cab,\u201d Shannon says. \u201cOur clients rely on us instead of other means.\u201d \r\n\r\nShannon\u2019s goal is to purchase another van and employ two full-time drivers by summer 2013. Without the help of an Accion loan, Shannon would need to wait before extending services, and would have to pay out of pocket for daily operating expenses. \r\n\r\nShannon says, \u201cI had a good experience with Accion. The rate we got was a lot lower than expected.\u201d

She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMa. Elma operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks to collect the garbage, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Aside from this she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan to buy recyclable materials and to buy scavenged materials from collectors which she will use in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she purchases more materials.  \r\n\r\nMa. Elma hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1241760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for recyclable materials and to buy scavenged materials from collectors which she will use in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T05:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T05:30:12Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

With the assistance of other Mary Kay consultants, Ofelia learned more about her new products and company.\r\n\r\nOfelia has a team of four consultants. She says the Accion Texas Inc. loan helped her business, especially considering she couldn\u2019t receive the assistance from a traditional bank. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional,\u201d she says. \r\n\r\nMary Kay offers Ofelia the opportunity to advance professionally. But without the Accion loan, purchasing the inventory needed to make sales would have been much more challenging.\r\n\r\nA friend who was a previous Accion client told her about the non-profit microlender, so she applied. The Accion lending team helped her understand the application and underwriting process at every turn and she was approved for a loan. \u201cIt was great working with Accion,\u201d she says. \r\n\r\nThe loan helps Ofelia make product information sheets and purchase inventory and miscellaneous materials to create appealing prizes for current clients. These items include bags, tissue paper, baskets and small products for current clients. Without an Accion loan, Ofelia says, \u201cI would have been able to purchase the inventory, but it would have been hard.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the Mary Kay products Ofelia offers, visit

The literal meaning of \"Golngai\" can be closely translated as \u201cbesotted friend\u201d. These tribal women belong to Kholep village of Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. In order to empower themselves and contribute to their family incomes, they mean to help one another to get a loan as a group.\r\n\r\nHevei is pictured with her hand raised. She is 38 years old and a mother to three sons and one daughter. Her husband, Seikhohao, earns money as a wood cutter. With a tight budget, they barely manage their children's schooling. She grows a homestead garden for food. Before she got a loan, she would work doing anything for a day\u2019s wage. There are times when she has to baby-sit and wash clothes to get paid. The nature of her work as a wage earner began to have an adverse effect on the children. Since then, to protect her children's emotions, she got a loan to make a difference in their lives.\r\n\r\nWith part of her first loan, she bought piglets and yarn to weave. She weaved three shawls in a month. With her second loan, she continued her activities and she was happy that she actually earned more than her previous daily wages. She actually bought a TV using her income, which made her children very proud. She said, \u201cThe day I bought the TV, I felt like I was on top of the world. It may sound funny for others but for me and my family it is a great achievement\u201d. Eventually, her activities became the source of the family income. She has contacts and plans to supply the woven shawls and wrap-round at a large scale to retailers of the same products.       \r\n\r\nShe needs and requested another loan from Kiva to improve upon her weaving activities. She wishes to continue weaving for her main source of income. She plans to utilize the loan to purchase one handloom (a simple machine to weave) and to buy yarn of varied quality to weave. Raising pigs is a long-term profit source, which she conveniently wishes to continue. This can serve as a backup plan for any emergency.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members, too, need and requested another loan to do better with their income-generating activities. The group is very happy to know that their loan comes from all around the world. The members pray for God\u2019s blessing for everyone who has lent their money to make a difference in their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1238126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase one handloom (a simple machine to weave) and buy yarn of varied quality to weave","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hevei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneihat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinkholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neipi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoimong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-22T12:07:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":499626,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivic is married with four children.

She lives together with her parents and siblings in their own house. Since she was young, she took responsibility for her family\u2019s business. She distributes her time between selling cheese and studying business administration in an accredited university in the city. In the town of Yauyos, she has a farm where she takes care of 100 cows. Her parents make the cheese from their milk and she sells it according to the molds\u2019 weight.\r\n\r\nShe receives orders from various neighboring cities, where people know about the good quality of the farm's products. In order to assure the product\u2019s quality she travels two times a month. The family also raises sheep and sells their meat. \"Some months, orders outrun my production, so I have to buy from other farmers in order to stock my business\", she says. She has now many orders and expects to be able to serve them, since her objective is to industrialize her production of cheese.\r\n\r\nDenisse is a member of the \"San Lorenzo\" group and this is the second credit with MFP, so she expects to get a small loan in order to meet her goals. On the other hand she promises to pay the installments in time, just as she did with the previous loan. She enjoys being a part of the association because all its members are responsible persons and work together as a team.\r\n\r\nIn case she gets this loan, she will invest it in cheese molds for her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1239822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cheese molds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T11:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T11:50:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denisse ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":105.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":110.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":115.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":124.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":126.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":134.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":138.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":144.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.26,"local_amount":105.65,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":110.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188898,"comment":null},{"amount":44.22,"local_amount":110.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":115.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572795,"comment":null},{"amount":46.29,"local_amount":115.71,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":120.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122459,"comment":null},{"amount":49.66,"local_amount":124.15,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":129.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868280,"comment":null},{"amount":50.41,"local_amount":126.04,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":131.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577098,"comment":null},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":134.01,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":139.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529381,"comment":null},{"amount":55.59,"local_amount":138.98,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":144.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974498,"comment":null},{"amount":57.96,"local_amount":144.9,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":151.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995929,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-22T14:42:08Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":499663,"name":"Darisuren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Darisuren is a 57-year-old widow who lives with her mother and her son in a house in Arkhangai Province, Mongolia.

She is married and has 3 children aged 19, 13 and 7.  In 2004, she established her tea shop business.  Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she supports her family.\r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid 4 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy food materials for her business.  In the future, Sanu plans to improve the financial condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nWhether on the streets of Kathmandu or in the villages outside of the capital, tea shops are places of business and meeting in Nepal.

Asad lives in Marneuli District with his wife and son. Asad has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but with no success, his requests consistently rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nThe only source of family income is agricultural activities, including their two cows whose milk is used in cheese production. Asad owns 0.7 hectare of land upon which he grows alfalfa. He also has a greenhouse and sows tomatoes and cucumbers. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nAsad's loan request from Credo was approved within the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the loan, Asad will build a new greenhouse which will enable him to grow more vegetables and thus increase the income of the family.

She has worked in agriculture and fishing for several years. She is a humble, dedicated, and enterprising woman who wants a better future for herself and her family. To her, this is the most important thing and it is what drives her to search for better alternatives. She lives in a rural area of the country and her home does not have electric lighting. These days, this is a basic necessity for the home, and Blanca knows that lighting is fundamental for her family to have a better quality of life. Therefore, she decided to request a loan from Integral. This loan will allow her to buy an environmentally-friendly lamp. This gives her an effective solution to her problem since it is low in cost, and it also uses renewable energy resources. This is just what she needs in order to have lighting at night in her home. Blanca Esther is very happy and enthusiastic for the help, and assures that she will pay off her debt. She also has confidence in God that he will provide her family with a full

His loan request was rejected each time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides that, Besarion has a 0.5 hectare vineyard and 27 persimmon trees. They produce wine and sell the cheese locally in an open market.  It is hardly enough food for such a large family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBesarion requested a loan from Credo to start-up his family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of thei low income. With the received credit, Besarion will purchase a car. As their existing income isn\u2019t enough for the family, and their living conditions are poor, Besarion decided to work as a taxi driver after buying the car.

Margret is 23 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past 2 years, Margret has been working hard to manage her small clothing business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Margret has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Margret to generate greater profits and pay for her medical bills and her child. Margret hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nMargret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1241993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She has made a living in her beauty salon for thirteen years.  She took specialized courses, which allowed her to perfect her skills and start her business, specifically cutting, styling, and coloring hair.  Now she's adding hair-removal services in response to client demand.  She works in a rented shop seven days a week from 2PM until 10PM.  Mornings she sells handbags and leather jackets at various businesses.  \r\n\r\nShe buys the merchandise and supplies she needs in the city of Santiago from different distributors and shops that specialize in hair products. \r\n\r\nMaria plans to use her loan to buy hair-styling products, a pot, and a table for hair-removal.  One of her goals is to be able to buy the shop she now rents and be the owner of her own salon.  That way she'll generate more income to provide for the financial well-being of her family.\r\n\r\nMaria lives with her husband, a twenty-four-year-old son who goes to the university, and a thirteen-year-old daughter who's in school.  Maria's professional dreams include being able to buy the shop so she can expand her business.  She is very glad and appreciative of the opportunity given to her by Fondo Esperanza because it will allow her to invest in her business.  She says there's really good communication within her communal bank, and the training has served to teach her new sales and accounting strategies.  \r\n\r\nPadre las Casa is a town in the south of Chile, near the city of Temuco in the Araucan\u00eda region.

is 47 years old. She lives in Lagodekhi District, East Georgia, with husband and son. Irma is also a librarian and gets monthly income. She requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 calves. Irma owns a bakery, where she bakes different kinds of rolls. It is hardly enough food for a three member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to start-up her family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Irma will purchase a milk cow and feeds for the cattle. She also plans to expand her shed and her dairy business. After buying a milk cow, she will be able to produce more dairy products and sell it locally at a good price. It will increase the income of the family.

She mainly offers rugs, from those round, palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. Because rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that a person can buy, sometimes even from a peddler while riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Nelia is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy larger quantities of raw materials, like fabric and thread, to use in making rugs. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNelia hopes to increase production, and dreams of being able to do her family good through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

la secundaria. Es divorciada y ha tenido que salir adelante con sus 4 hijos a quienes educa para un d\u00eda verlos convertidos en profesionales. Vive en el cant\u00f3n Pastaza ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta ciudad. La competencia entre microempresarios es muy grande, sin embargo cada uno ha puesto su valor agregado para ganar preferencia con los clientes. \nMar\u00eda Isabel ha buscado las formas de dar a sus hijos una buena educaci\u00f3n y adem\u00e1s la calidad de vida que ellos se merecen, es por eso que hace 10 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con un restaurant peque\u00f1o en donde ofrece comida r\u00e1pida y tradicional. Son 10 horas las que invierte en esta actividad, esperando obtener recompensa rentable. Su padre le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a llevar a cabo este negocio y est\u00e1 muy agradecida con \u00e9l, pues gracias al esp\u00edritu emprendedor que hered\u00f3 de su padre, Mar\u00eda cada a\u00f1o mejora su negocio y aun cuando se qued\u00f3 sin nada por un rob\u00f3 que sufri\u00f3 en el local, no se ha dado por vencida, inclusive ha buscado otras alternativas de generar ingresos como es la venta de ropa por cat\u00e1logo. En muchas ocasiones sus clientes compran los platos que prepara Mar\u00eda pero tienen que servirse sin la comodidad de una mesa o una silla, ya que las pocas mesas con las que cuenta en el local siempre est\u00e1n ocupadas. Es por eso que Mar\u00eda ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de mobiliario para adecuar su restaurant con las comodidades que demandan sus clientes. Ella encontr\u00f3 en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa la mejor opci\u00f3n para solicitar este cr\u00e9dito, ya que en esta instituci\u00f3n se preocupan porque las personas superen la pobreza y adem\u00e1s le brindan asesor\u00eda y facilidad para la obtenci\u00f3n de cr\u00e9dito. Mar\u00eda Isabel espera que con esta inversi\u00f3n sus ventas se multipliquen y su negocio genere m\u00e1s utilidades que le permitan reinvertir y tambi\u00e9n mejorar su estilo de vida y el de sus hijos. ","en":"Mar\u00eda Isabel is a thirty-eight-year-old woman, who, when she was young, did not succeed in continuing on to university studies and completed her studies after high school.  She's divorced and has had to get ahead with four children who she's sending to school so that one day they'll become professionals.  She lives in the Pastaza canton, located in the province of the same name, in the Amazon region of the Republic of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the canton is the city of Puyo, located in the middle of the of the Amazon jungle in the western portion of Pastaza Province and is at 924m above sea level.   The population is small, but there is a wide variety of areas preferred by domestic and international tourists, primarily for ecological activities and extreme sports.  It's a city that is growing by the day economically due to commerce, livestock, agriculture, and tourism, and so financial and commercial companies have established branches to take advantage of the economic activity the city supports.  Competition among small-business people is very stiff, yet they all offer up their added value in order to win clients' favor.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel has sought out ways to give her children a good education and the quality of life they deserve, so she has invested ten years running a small restaurant where she offers fast food and traditional food, waiting to earn a profitable reward.  Her father taught her how to run this kind of business and she's very grateful to him, because, thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit she inherited from him, she improves the business every year.  Even when the business was robbed and left her with nothing, she was not defeated, and has even looked for other alternative to make money, like catalog clothing sales.\r\n\r\nSo often, Mar\u00edas clients order the dishes she prepares, but have to be served without the comfort of tables and chairs because the few tables the restaurant has are always filled.  That's why Mar\u00eda is seeking loan, so she can buy furniture to outfit her restaurant with the comfort clients demand.  She found Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to be the best option for getting a loan, because the institution concerns itself with helping people overcome poverty by provides lending advice and facilitating loans.  Mar\u00eda Isabel hopes that, with the investment, her sales will multiply and her business will generate more profits that she can reinvest to improve her and her children's lifestyle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1242315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"para comprar

He is a single dad to two children who he loves and who are his driving force in life. Urbano is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who puts all his effort into getting his family ahead in life. Unfortunately Urbano was unable to finish primary school as he had to work from very early on to support his parents given that his family had a very low income, although he very much would have liked to have pursued a professional career in Accountancy. In his free time, Urbano likes watching television and on some occasions cooks a delicious dish of rice with duck to spoil his children as it is their favorite food.\r\n\r\nAt his own initiative, and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Urbano works providing his freighting services, and has a small motorcycle with an attached trailer which he uses to work. Urbano works every day from the early hours in the morning and he can do this for approximately 12 hours. He feels comfortable performing his job and thinks that it is going well because of the friendly treatment that he offers to his customers.\r\n\r\nUrbano is very grateful to the Kiva loan lenders as it is thanks to the help given that he will be able to repair and overhaul his motorcycle. In this manner he will be able to rely on his work tool that is in good conditions to continue offering his services. That is how Urbano will continue working and forging ahead to make his biggest dream come true, that of seeing his children become good
