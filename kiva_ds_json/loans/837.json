is Peter, 54, a resident of Manila, Philippines. He is single. He manages his household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nPeter operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines and, while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. He will be incorporating the loan into his current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nPeter hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he fervently hopes that his adopted children will be able to have a good future through all his hard work in his business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Gulsana was born in a large shepherd family with 7 children. After school she got married to a man from the same village and in the period 1991 to 1997 she gave birth to four children. During this time she was a housewife, and her husband was engaged in agriculture. \r\n\r\nBecause the life in the village became very hard, Gulsana and her husband moved to the city of Bishkek in 2000, where her husband found work as a loader at the market \"Dordoi\", in order to pay for the family's food and rent. In the period 2001-2011 Gulsana's husband for periods went to Russia as a migrant worker, and was able to buy a house in the village of Sosnovka. During this time the family expanded with four more children. In 2011, Gulsana was awarded the honorary title \"Mother Heroine\".\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Gulsana and her husband purchased a \"container\" (point of sales) at the market in the city of Kara-Balta (Chuysky province, Javil district) and started selling food products. Currently Gulsana and her husband are selling food products at their own point of sales. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulsana turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for broadening the assortment of goods. Gulsana plans to invest the income from the loan in developing her business, in order to have an opportunity to give all her children education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1076546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Comadres\u201d is made up of fifteen indigenous, humble, working woman who want to improve their lives.  The members are from Pinotepa Nacional, an area where people dance the Chilenas and where they speak Mixtec.\r\nOne of the members of the group is Librada Miverda, thirty-six, a cheerful and chatty woman.  Her friends call her Mine and she has sold Herbalife products for the past three years.\r\nShe has a small stand near the hospital where she sells her products and also makes malted milkshakes, teas and yogurt.  Mine tells us that what she likes most about her business is helping her customers have a better quality of life and good health.\r\nShe is happily married to Javier, thirty-six, and they have two children, Ada Lizabeth, thirteen, and Iitzad Iizbeth, sixteen.  They are the reason she wants to get ahead and improve their quality of life.  Mine is requesting the loan to buy more Herbalife products to sell wholesale and retail since her business is giving her good earnings.  That way she can have more income to help her children and provide them with a better education.  One of the things that makes her sad is that some of the people are suspicious of what she sells as if the products were bad for their health. She also tells us that she delivers her merchandise to customers\u2019 homes and that she makes her malted milk shakes with oatmeal, natural Herbalife flavoring and ice.\r\nShe blends all in the blender, adds ice, blends again, and serves it with cinnamon for their enjoyment. Ones of the nice things about Mine is that she cares about people\u2018s health, both thin and heavy, so that their bodies feel well.  Mine thanks the Foundation because with their assistance, her business grows every day and she can help people eat nutritiously.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nRosa Elia- who sells

It is made up of thirteen indigenous women who want to improve their social condition.  They speak Mixtec and wear traditional skirts and shawls. \r\nThe members of this group are natives of a town called Santa Catarina Mechoacan.  It is a small town with a lot of green trees.  There is a very beautiful river, as you enter the community.\r\nThe name of the town, Santa Catarina Mechoacan, means \"fishing town\" in Mixtec.  The members of the communal bank tell us that a long time ago the river was full of fish, and the people from the community would fish very early in the morning. \r\nOne of the members of the communal bank is Se\u00f1ora Maria de Jes\u00fas.  She is fifty-six years old and is a hardworking indigenous woman.  She is a little shy but very friendly.  She earns a living making and selling bread. \r\nSe\u00f1ora Maria de Jes\u00fas tells us that she has been selling bread for twenty years.  What she likes best about her business is making the bread, which she does with love.\r\nShe makes her bread in an earthen oven (which is in the background of the above photo).  She sells the bread in the Ri\u00f3 Grande community every third day.  What she doesn't like is that she gets overheated making the bread and that her back aches, as she carries the tray of bread on her back as she sells it door to door.  Sometimes, though, she takes orders, and she always tries to deliver on time.\r\nOne of Se\u00f1ora Maria de Jes\u00fas's dreams and goals is to modernize her equipment so that she doesn't get so overheated or tired.  She does get a little tired, because of her age. \r\nOne of her challenges is exapnding her business.  She wants to have employees make the bread and deliver it to more communities besides Ri\u00f3 Grande.\r\nShe also tells us that she will use the loan to purchase more bread-making ingredients, like: yeast, milk, baking powder, sugar, butter and lard.\r\nThe loan will also help her improve her house, since her earnings have enabled her to fix it up, to make it more resistant.\r\nSe\u00f1ora Maria de Jes\u00fas is very grateful to the Foundation for the help they have given her to make her life better and meet her goals and dreams.\r\nThe other members of the communal bank are:\r\nZoila- who makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nMargarita Rogelia- makes her living selling bread.\r\nLucina- makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nMaria- makes her living offering carpentry

Two years ago, she saw this dream come true when she founded her home-based wholesale jewelry company in Miami, Florida. Her company primarily specializes in the sale of stainless steel jewelry. Ever since the founding of her company, she has loved the independence it has given her and she has seen overwhelming success. This success has inspired her to diversify her company into an individual seller of jewelry as well as a wholesaler. She also hopes that, through new business permits, she will be able to diversify the products that she sells to become a more well-rounded retailer and serve a larger variety of customers.

Miguel makes a living growing coffee, and 6 years ago, he started his own small grocery store.  He has stocked it little by little.  He works with his wife, and they have a schedule from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.  One of the disadvantages is that in some months, the sales are lower, but with good administration of the business, Miguel and his wife have been able to get ahead.  Their family has scarce economic resources, so they make the most of each opportunity that presents inself.  The loan that he is requesting is to stock his grocery store with products like:  rice, flour, eggs, sugar, butter, soap, etc.  With the help of this loan, Miguel will be able to keep his business well-stocked and help support his family.

However, her salary does not cover being able to purchase construction materials all at once.  That is why she comes, once again, to the institution that has supported her in an unconditional way.  \r\n\r\nShe now needs the loan to raise the roof and to build a room.

She is 37 years old and the mother of two adorable children for whom she works very hard.  She puts in a lot of effort every day to get ahead on her own, since the father of her little ones left her a few years ago.  Her home is in the city of Pisco, which is known for having a hot, comfortable climate.  It is also very well known because it is the site of one of the country's most important tourist attractions, the Ballestas Islands and Paracas' El Candelabro.\r\n\r\nAt first she sold fruit for a living, but as time went on, her sales went down and one of her little ones got sick and she had to use the little money she had for working capital to take him to the doctor.  After that happened, she began to save and, with a lot of effort, Juana started her business selling chicken soup in her home.  She works about eight hours a day, especially at night, since there is a lot of business at that time.  She thinks her business is going well because her seasoning is very good and that's why her customers always come back.\r\n\r\nJuana is very thankful to Kiva's lenders, as it is thanks to the great help she has received from them that she will be able to buy ingredients to make her soups, such as bulk vegetables.  She will also be able to make improvements to her home, which will allow her to offer her children a better quality of life and keep struggling every day to make her biggest dream a reality: to have a big restaurant and to offer her children the best

Before reaching the community, there is an arroyo (stream bed) called Tuzapa.  In San Franciso de Maguey, there are approximately two hundred homes amid the many green trees.  One of San Franciso de Maguey\u2019s traditions is the cowboy dance, celebrated on the Day of the Dead.   Men, both young and old, come out to dance in the streets of the community dressed in red suits and hats, and carrying canes. They dance to the music of wind instruments as the citizens accompany them, applauding each dance.  \r\n\r\nOne of the members of the Liberaci\u00f3n Group is Gelacia, a cheerful, talkative, and fun lady.  Gelacia has been selling tortillas for eight years.  She tells us that she has a tortilla called La Nina.  She has two workers in the tortiller\u00eda (tortilla shop) who operate the machines and wash the nixtamal (cooked maize).  Gelacia also helps her employees by weighing the tortillas and selling them at the tortiller\u00eda while they go to the community suburbs by motor cycle to sell more tortillas.  She tells us that she is very happy with her work because it provides her with good profits that enable her to grow her business more and generate work.  What she dislikes about her business is that the tortiller\u00eda gets overheated and it\u2019s very hot.  As a result, she and her employees become very dehydrated.  \r\n\r\nShe is happily married to Pedro who is sixty-six years old.  They have seven children who are already married.  Gelicia tells us that she will use the loan to purchase more corn, lime, and tortilla wrapping paper and also to repair the tortilla machine.  She is very grateful to the foundation for helping working people who desire to improve their lives and their community.\r\n\r\nA list of the other members follows:\r\nJuana, who sells cold meats\r\nMaria, who sells cold meats\r\nCriselda, who sells meals\r\nEfr\u00e9n, who sells groceries\r\nHip\u00f3lita Cytlaly, who sells clothing\r\n\r\nThey thank the foundation for helping all the people who wish to see a better future and a better Mexico for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":1066832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients for making tortillas.

The market is very good now that it's the school year, and most of his customers are students who are already regulars that he transports from La Matanza to Cruz Verde, and that's why the investment in maintenance will be a benefit as much for his customers as for himself.\r\n\r\nHis primary objective is to give good service and more than anything, to attract more customers and gain their loyalty, and for this reason he treats customers respectfully and responsibly and has an overall feeling of trustworthiness, and this is the reason that he will never want for work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1069629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy tools to maintain his farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Matanza - Morrop\u00f3n - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Raul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1508,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":103.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":110.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":114.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":119.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":128.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":131.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":134.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":140.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":144.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":148.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.67,"local_amount":214.2,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":217.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332862,"comment":null},{"amount":42.33,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":112.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423630,"comment":null},{"amount":43.73,"local_amount":114.7,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":116.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317043,"comment":null},{"amount":45.65,"local_amount":119.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":121.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373876,"comment":null},{"amount":361.62,"local_amount":948.4,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":963.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385124,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-22T10:05:41Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:00:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":416342,"name":"Merlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlita is 40 years old and lives in Buenavista, Pagadian City.

She is married to Rodolfo, her business partner, and is the mother of three children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCelia hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

is 44 years old. He lives in a small village in Sagarejo district with his family: wife \u2013 Lia and 15-year-old son who goes to school. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is agriculture. They have a milk cow. Lia produces and sells on average 15 kg of cheese on the local open market per month. Along with the abovementioned, Vazha has a horse. He takes wood from the forest to the village with his horse.  The wood is sold in the village among the local population. They consume it for heating their houses.

their lives.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are from Pinotepa Nacional in Oaxaca state, a land of hard-working people and progress; but also much hunger, as there are many poor people, although there are plenty who take more than their fair share.  \r\n\r\nIn Pinotepa the most popular dance is the Chilena. In Pinotepa there are small businesses and also many children playing in the park, and many women selling tamales in the streets of the community.\r\n\r\nOne of Pinotepa's traditions is the \"Fifth Friday\" holiday where there are a lot of fun and games in the streets for the children, and one can see the Pilgrimage, a play about the life of Jesus Christ. People go out to watch the youth who perform the play. For the people, that day is one of repentance and forgiveness, and a day to enjoy oneself and forgive others.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Maria Emiliana. She is 49, and known for being a friendly, hard-working woman, who is very proud of her roots and  her business.\r\n\r\nEmilia, as she is better known by her fellow group members, sells soft drinks and tamales. She has been selling soft drinks and tamales for 20 years. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about selling tamales is the preparation. Emilia tells us that the tamales are prepared in the following way: First, heat the banana leaves and clean them. Then prepare the chili, adding add half an onion, puya and gaguillo chilis, garlic; then grind them together. Then wash the chicken meat and put it, together with the prepared chili on a large platter. Prepare the dough adding lard. To make a tortilla out of the dough, you place the leaf down, and put a bit of the dough on top and flatten it. Add both the chili and the chicken. Fold the leaf into the shape of a tamale, and put all of this together on the fire. Wait for them to cook, take them out of the pot, and let people know you have tamales, so that your customers come and buy from you.\r\n\r\nEmiliana has six children: Maria de Jes\u00fas, Mois\u00e9s, Eleazar, Francisco, Angelo and Juan Jos\u00e9. They motivate her to keep going, as she really loves them and wants them to always count on her. Emiliana is happily married to Eleazar, 51, a friendly and hard-working man. \r\n\r\nEmiliana also tells us that she sells handmade tortillas, yet doesn't intend to return to the tortilla business: only when she has orders for them. She doesn't make tortillas every day, because making them is hard on the the lungs.\r\n\r\nEmiliana also sells food, chicken mole (chicken in a spicy sauce), chicken soup, fish soup, barbecued meat, and abobo de marrano (marinated pork).\r\n\r\nEmiliana requested the loan to buy more soft drinks and more ingredients for making tamales. She is very grateful to the Foundation for helping her earn her daily living.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Rocio, who sells candy; Elizabeth, who sells Mexican snack foods; Ignacia, who sells Mexican snack foods; Adela, who sells clothing; Adelaida, who sells clothing; and Maria de Jes\u00fas, who sells chickens.\r\n\r\nThey give thanks to the Foundation for helping them to appreciate things and benefit from life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1066805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy soft drinks and ingredients for making tamales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-23T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-23T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria  Emiliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5666.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656846,"comment":null},{"amount":718.75,"local_amount":9375,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:05:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9443.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317523,"comment":null},{"amount":575,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":7555.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418908,"comment":null},{"amount":575,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7555.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568484,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-23T20:21:49Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":414825,"name":"Sonrisas Frente Al Mar Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Banco comunal se llama \u201cSonrisas Frente al Mar\u201d est\u00e1 conformado por 18 emprendedores, quienes se dedican a diferentes rubros, entre los cuales se encuentran artesan\u00eda, preparaci\u00f3n de productos de reposter\u00eda, venta de abarrotes, entre otros.

\n\n","en":"Svetlana is 57 years old, has raised one daughter and takes care of three grandchildren. Svetlana was born in a simple family; her father and mother were teachers at the local school. After having finished school, Svetlana started medical studies in 1972, and got married in the same year. In 1973 Svetlana gave birth to her daughter, and 6 months after their daughter was born, Svetlana's husband left her for another woman. Being a strong woman, Svetlana succeeded in finishing medical school and got a job as a nurse. \n\nIn 1985 Svetlana started working as a nurse in a psycho-neurological home, an institution where she also works today. Her work experience in this institution is 27 years. After 10 years of devoted work, the administration gave Svetlana an apartment and a private agricultural property, where she started engaging in livestock breeding. \n\nThanks to her persistence, perseverance and her belief in herself, Svetlana managed to raise her daughter all by herself, give her an education and in 1990 happily marry her off. Currently the daughter and her husband are migrant workers in Russia. Svetlana is still engaged in livestock breeding, and she has one dairy cow, one bull and six sheep at her farm. \n\nWith an aim to further develop her farm, Svetlana turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of livestock. Svetlana plans to invest the income from the loan in further expanding her farm, so that she has opportunity to help her daughter, so that she does not have to leave her children in the search of work.

She is 47 years old and a resident of Palawan, Philippines. She is single and manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNilda operates a variety store with the help of a single employee. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go in order to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Rice and fuel are among the item she carries; these being basic necessities. \r\n\r\nShe is also a dealer of sawali, a native housing material made out of buho, a species of bamboo indigenous in the Philippines. The bamboo is split, the skin is separated from the body and dried in the sun. Then it is woven to make the sawali, a cheap but durable material for walls and partitions. Located along the national highway, Nilda\u2019s store gets a portion of its sales from commuters and passersby, but the mainstay of her business are the residents of the surrounding rural areas. She earns a minimum of 1000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nNilda needs an additional PHP 15,000 for her business. The loan will be used to purchase additional products for her store. A portion of her loan is also used to finance the sawali makers from whom she gets her supply. It will allow her to continue and expand her operations. \r\n\r\nAs with all businesspersons, Nilda dreams of expanding and succeeding in her chosen business. Having no family of her own she vows to use the fruits of her enterprise to help others and to save for the future. She also aspires to know Jesus Christ more deeply. She relies on the guidance of her C.C.T. fellowship group in her walk with Christ.\r\n\r\n*All C.C.T. community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship group gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance loans.

She is 34 years old and a resident of Palawan, Philippines. She is married to Freddie, a self-employed furniture maker, and a mother to her three children. Two of them are in grade school with the youngest not yet of school age. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide an income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArlyn has been operating a variety store for the past 12 years in Palawan. Essentially, a variety store is a small convenience store, which retails basic necessities, such as canned goods, beverages, toiletries and, in rural areas such as Busuanga, even rice and gasoline. Arlyn earns by buying in bulk, marking these up and selling by the piece. She nets around PHP 335 daily from the operation of her store and from selling sawali on the side.\r\n\r\nArlyn needs PHP 16,000 to add to her existing capital. She believes that this amount would help her sustain and expand her business. It would be used to boost the product inventory of her store. And it would also enable her to order more sawali from her suppliers to cope with the rising demand due to the upswing of construction in the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nArlyn\u2019s 12 years in business is a testimony to her grit and determination to succeed. She has had her share of challenges. Chief among them are delayed payments from her customers. She has also learned the lesson that profit from business should be plowed back into the enterprise to make it viable and strong. This in turn will ultimately ensure her family\u2019s future.\r\n\r\nA firm believer that education is the path to a brighter tomorrow, Arlyn dreams of seeing all her three children finish college. An active C.C.T. partner, Arlyn meets with her co-fellowship members every Monday to give mutual support, pray for one another and study scriptures as well as to monitor the status of individual loans.\r\n\r\n*All C.C.T. community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.
