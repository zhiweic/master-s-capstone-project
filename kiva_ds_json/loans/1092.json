She is now on her sixth loan, which will help her to increase her business and to buy 35 bags of onions (20 bags of small-bulb onions and 15 bags of large-bulb onions).\r\n\r\nMariam sells her goods for cash to a customer base which mostly consists of housekeepers.\r\n\r\nThanks to this new loan, Mariam is expecting average monthly profits to reach 80,000 CFA francs, which will be used to contribute to the family expenses and to pay off her loan's interest.  The rest will be reinvested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1327169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy condiments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-06T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-06T01:50:08Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":33839.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030121,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":33839.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819614,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":33839.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678504,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":33839.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678505,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.68,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67678.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924144,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-06T09:29:31Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:55:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544648,"name":"Katherin Yulieth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Es KATHERIN tiene 22 a\u00f1os, tiene una hija de 5 a\u00f1os se llama juliana  la cual es su vida tiene esposo con el cual llevo 6 a\u00f1os \u00e9l se llama Sergio vive con la suegra que es una gran ayuda y  ha sido la persona que le ha tendido la mano.

She has a daughter named Juliana, 5, who is her life.  She has been with her husband, Sergio, for six years.  She lives with her mother-in-law, who's a big help and has given her a hand.  \r\n\r\nShe studied a lot as a first-aid technician in the Red Cross.  She finished high school with a lot of effort when she was 18, because she had her daughter when she was 17.  She has worked since she was young to pay for school, so she knows what it is to take money out of your pocket to pay for the things you want.  This is why she learned to appreciate things.\r\n\r\nShe has worked at everything: as a babysitter, in gardens, as a pre-school assistant, brushing hair in the home, selling shoes and clothing, in restaurants.  All this has helped her get experience and know what it is to work.\r\n\r\nShe wants to finish her program to be able to give her daughter a better quality of life and have her own spa, be her own boss, and do what she likes, although she works in a company that has nothing do do with this.  She likes it because thanks to this job she managed to begin studying the profession she always wanted to.\r\n\r\nShe considers herself a responsible, sensible, and committed person who's dedicated to the things that make her put passion into everything.  She's a good mother and she always achieves what she sets out to.\r\n\r\nShe knows that with this help from Kiva she'll save money to be able to buy the materials required by her program so she can begin to practice her profession by giving massages in the home.  It's a good way to begin to get experience and clients.  When she achieves her dream of setting up her own spa she'll have the patients who will help her get ahead with her dream.\r\n\r\nFinally, she wants to thank those who are giving an opportunity to all the people connected to this agreement between CampoAlto and Kiva.  Many, many thanks for helping people like herself who have a lot of dreams and goals for improvement so they can give their families the quality of life they deserve.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to finish her cosmetology program","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-06T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-06T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katherin Yulieth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197702,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-07T10:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891024,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912436,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-06T04:52:25Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545008,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine, 38 years old, is married to a farmer.

Prior to that, he had worked in several different places, but the salaries that they offered were not sufficient to cover his living expenses, so he changed his employment. His current business is going very well, and he has his own regular clients. He needs to repair his vehicle, but he does not have the financial means to do so. He is seeking a loan of 5,000 Tajikistan Somoni to fix his car. This is first loan request from our organisation and he promises to repay it.

Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Hamlet will purchase a car and a stock of fruits and vegetables to start trading himself. Hamlet will go to the local market in the capital city, buy products at the wholesale price and sell it to the resellers with the price mark-up in his district.  He is already very experienced in this field so he hopes the new business will be profitable.

lives in Malava, a small town in Kakamega county. Kakamega county is located in Western Kenya and is famous for having the only tropical rain forest in the country. Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping. \r\n\r\nMatayo is married, and has one child. His wife is also a farmer, and together they grow maize, beans and cassava, and also keep poultry on their land. Matayo likes beekeeping because bees are easy to keep and don't require management. He also enjoys working with Honey Care because they don't destroy the honey combs while harvesting, allowing the colonies to produce even more honey. \r\n\r\nThis is Matayo's first loan, and he plans to use the income generated from his hives to start a maize selling business or open a small shop. In the future, Matayo hopes to purchase a motorbike that will help him transport his maize from his home to the market.

She obtained a license from the city to open her store. In the meantime, she has encountered a few difficulties along the way, such as having to take over sole responsibility for supporting her household. This has been difficult because she would have liked to have a little more help from other members of her family. However this does not mean she is not able to work hard for all the things she wants in life; rather it encourages her to continue excelling.\r\n\r\nJacqueline will use her loan to purchase more supplies for her stationary and shipping store.

is a married man, aged 44, who lives at Kanagisa village with his three children and wife.

Now he has over 60 Ankole long-horned cattle (local breeds). He also grows plantain and maize, but on a medium scale. He sells his agricultural products to the local community, most especially fishermen from a Kanagisa fishing site and cattle traders from Kampala.\r\n\r\nThe reason why he started farming was for personal development, and for that reason he has managed to acquire several plots of land from the neighbouring trading centre and various bibanja around Kanagisa and the neighboring villages.  He has acquired this loan to buy more cows in order to increase the quantity of milk he supplies.  He hopes to expand his business to the level of supplying 1000 liters of milk every day and to take good care of his family with all desired materials.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the challenges he faces are limited capital and unpredictable weather changes.  He describes himself as a humble and hardworking man.\r\nHe urges money lenders to take good care of their animals in order to reduce animal diseases.  This will help them to open up markets which were closed, and, as a result, there will be customers (clients) for the animals.  Therefore, there will be business growth.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":360,"image":{"id":1326466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-04-06T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-06T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993929,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040632,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831261,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689470,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480608,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879773,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983444,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635583,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863062,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-07T23:57:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545161,"name":"Enkhbold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Enkhbold, 33 years old, lives with his wife and daughter in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

Now, he lives in Kapan together with his wife, sons and daughters.  His children are already grown and each has a job for which they've studied for.  Robert's wife is a teacher and works at a boarding school.  For 10 years, he has worked as a taxi driver for various services in Kapan.  In recent years, he's been driving his own vehicle as a private driver.  He says the number of his clients increased after purchasing his own car as did his profits.  Robert is very happy that during these difficult times he is able to provide for his family.  A loan of 500,000 Armenian dram will help Robert change the upholstery in his new car and to make a few technical repairs.  After this work, his car will be safe and comfortable for his clients."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":402.07,"image":{"id":1326513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

Nosheen has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband can buy new tools for his shop. The old tools are obsolete and there is no demand for them now.  After getting the loan, she will invest the money in her husband's business and he can buy new tools like drill machines, hammers, PVC pipes, joints, wiring, etc.  In this way, he can expand his business, and their monthly income can be increased. With the profit amount, Nosheen intends to pay her household expenses. She is looking forward for the bright future of her children.

25-year-old Francis; he owns a mobile money transfer business in Nakonde district. His shop is located on the border of Zambia and Tanzania. The town where his shop is located is one of the biggest border towns in Zambia, with a high traffic of business taking place. This is his story....\r\n\r\nMy name is Francis. I am 25 years old. I have two brothers, and one sister. I started running my own business while I was in school. I had a camera that I would use to take pictures of people; then I would develop the pictures and sell them. This helped me to raise money to pay for my school fees. When I completed high school, I worked in a shop as a shopkeeper, and continued to take pictures in my spare time. Through my job and photography business, I was able to raise enough money to open my own mobile money transfers shop in Nakonde, a border town.\r\n\r\nMy mobile money transfer business gives me the pleasure to associate with different people. I enjoy the comfort of running the business without being answerable to anyone but myself. I have clear goals and expectations of what I want to achieve.  When it comes to my customers, I believe that they benefit from my business because it helps them send money to their distant relatives, such as children in schools, colleges, etc. They are also able to buy mobile phone airtime from my shop.\r\n\r\nI am appealing to you, Kiva lenders, to help me with this loan. I will use the loan as the working capital float for my business. Currently, I have very little working capital, which slows down my transactions. My business is located at a border town, and as such the demand is very high, and sometimes I have to keep customers waiting because I have no cash to satisfy them. Once I get the loan, I believe that the growth of my business will be evident because I will have money readily available for my customers who want to receive money. This will help me to earn more commissions. The commissions are heavily dependent on how many customers I serve.

She and her husband have a daughter who is a minor and who attends school.  She works in agriculture along with her husband.  They produce mainly coffee.   Adelina has been doing this work for more than 5 years, because she learned how to farm from her parents when she was very young.  As a result, this is the type of work that she still continues to do now.  Adelina has a second grade education; she was not able to complete elementary school because her parents earned very little.  Now, she and her husband support each other so that they can get ahead with their dependent daughter.  Their coffee cultivations are located 2 kilometers from their house, and so they travel in a private car to get to their crops.\r\n\r\nAdelina is requesting help so that she can purchase organic and chemical fertilizers and fumigation pumps to maintain her coffee crops.  If she doesn't provide this maintenance and care to her crops, they may get damaged over time by the Roya fungus, which particularly affects this type of crop.\r\n\r\nAdelina dreams of educating her daughter so that she can have a better quality of life and better work opportunities, because working the land is so hard. There is so much environmental pollution and lack of supplies to care for the land, and the earnings are low.  In this way, she can prepare her daughter. Through this request, Adelina will strengthen her crops so that she will get an excellent harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1326681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic and chemical fertilizers and fumigation pumps to maintain her coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-04-06T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-06T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":14500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T03:02:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545194,"name":"Nasreen Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasreen is 31 years old.

","en":"Suhrob is an honest and fair-minded young man. He is 27 years old, married, and has 2 children who are in school. His wife is a teacher at the local high school. They live happily in a large house that has a fruit orchard and a big cattle shed where Suhrob keeps cows. For the last 12 years, he has been raising cattle. He now has 7 cows, calves, and 1 horse. He knows all the ins and outs of animal husbandry and is skilled at his business. He purchases livestock, takes care of them for several months, then sells them at the local market.

This will increase sales and improve the family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

His goal is to expand his business and start selling in other regions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1325556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy wood to make doors and sell them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Juan Pueblo.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2013-04-07T10:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-07T10:00:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":730.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":912.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":944.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":978.8},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1013.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1087.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1126.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1167.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1209.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1252.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.94,"local_amount":730.79,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":743.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373195073,"comment":null},{"amount":47.37,"local_amount":912.25,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-27T08:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":928.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382007062,"comment":null},{"amount":99.89,"local_amount":1923.74,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1957.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390870049,"comment":null},{"amount":52.64,"local_amount":1013.88,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T17:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1031.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410187041,"comment":null},{"amount":54.53,"local_amount":1050.21,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T19:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1068.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419950460,"comment":null},{"amount":56.49,"local_amount":1087.84,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1106.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430129583,"comment":null},{"amount":326.14,"local_amount":6281.29,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6391.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829419,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-12T23:17:47Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:50:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545232,"name":"Parwin's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parwin is a 24-year-old, young Iraqi woman.

She successfully repaid the loan and is now working on making further improvements to her business. She has now requested a new loan to be able to buy a generator, an embroidery machine and a water dispenser\/cooler.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

She went to school through fourth grade and could not continue due to a lack of financial support since her parents had limited resources and could not support her.  \r\n\r\nSince her childhood, she has worked cultivating coffee.  Her family did this work and today it supports her family.  Her parents taught her to work the land more than twenty years ago and now she works with her husband.  Their land was purchased after many years of sacrifice to save and purchase the land they cultivate today.

She holds a positive view of her business' success because she plans to sell these items at a junction where the demand of such items is very high and where there are few people selling them. She has many people in that community who will buy from her at regular intervals, and she plans to sell to them at reduced prices so as to have a quick turnover. With this activity the community needs will be met; the community faces a problem getting provisions since they have to travel long distances to get what they need.  Sophie's regular customers will benefit from free gifts also.\r\n\r\nThe profit from the loan will be used to buy medication for Sophie's children, their education, and also to feed the family.

Educating her children is another challenge in her life. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she has requested, she plans to buy food items for her restaurant, such as rice, beans, maize, oil and spices. She will also improve the present state of her business site. She believes that the business will succeed because she has a good location for her business, she charges moderate prices and has ready customers to buy her food items.\r\n\r\nWith the profits from this loan, she will take care of her family\u2019s needs for food, medication and education. She will expand her business in the future and help vulnerable children in her community.\r\n\r\nShe prefers loans from Grounded and Holistic Approach for People\u2019s Empowerment because of the organization\u2019s low interest rates, its installment repayment intervals and, most of all, the training offered at GHAPE

He is positive the business will succeed because he has experience, and he will buy a good breed of piglets and chicks and also buy a well mixed feed for their feeding. With this activity the community will benefit from the droppings from the animals as manure for the fertilization of their farms thus leading to improved yields. \r\n\r\nThe profit from the loan will be used for feeding his family, educating his children, expansion of the business by buying more piglets and chicks, and also for future investment.

Her husband is a good man, but he earns very little money.  For more than ten years, Sayohat has been raising and selling cattle to earn extra money to support the family.  Presently, she has three cows.  Besides raising cattle, she sells milk and kefir to the locals.

He is the coordinator of his group, which is called Union y Amor (Union and Love) 4. He has been running a grocery store for ten years, after starting it with his own savings. He will invest this loan in his grocery store and buy products such as rice, beans, sugar, cooking oil, canned food, and many other goods.\r\n\r\nWilfredo lives with his long term partner in their simple home.

lives in the Mombasa area of Coast Province, Kenya. She is married and the mother of five children, although only the youngest is in school. She is a fresh juice vendor, a business she has been operating for three years. She started the business with her savings. She learned about Milango through a friend who invited her to the group, and she joined with an aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations. Her main challenges are the high cost of materials and unpredictable weather, which interferes with the steady supply of fruits. Sophia is applying a loan of 41,900 KES (Kenya shillings) to buy fruits wholesale and to put up a structure where she can sell the products. The extra income will be used to pay school fees for her child. She aspires to expand the business to one that is bigger than the one she has and to serve more

","en":"Dilbar began taking out loans 4 years ago, and in this time, she has made progress in her work and her life. Though it is generally considered a man's field, circumstances worked out such that she earns a living in animal husbandry. She started out with one cow which she fattened and sold for a small profit. With each year, with the help of loans from MDO Arvand, she has gradually increased her herd. Having gained more experience, Dilbar has started to raise cattle and sell dairy products, the profit from which allows her to cover the daily living expenses of her children. She has 5 kids and she needs a certain amount of money to pay for their daily school needs and monthly educational costs. She really wants her children to become educated, and to this end, she is working hard to provide at least the basic means for them to study well and learn a specialisation. At present though, her kids help her in her small family business by cleaning the cattle shed and selling milk. Dilbar's motto is \"every minute is precious.\" Despite her age, she also works as a cleaner on a collective farm because in the near future, she will host her son's wedding, and this will require a significant outlay of cash. As Dilbar herself says, \"I still need to work and earn money, and later there will come the time when I can sit and take care of my grandchildren.\" Life has required her to be strong and decisive like a man, thrifty and sensitive like a woman, a caring wife, and a loving mother. Dilbar has once more approached MDO Arvand for a loan to purchase more cattle and cattle feed. She is really hoping for support and is grateful in advance for the cooperation and assistance.

is married, has five children and lives with her family in a three bed apartment house in Bafut Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. She has faced many challenges in life including: sickness in her family, poverty, the death of both parents leaving her to care for her younger siblings, the death of her son after a brief illness that led to spending money to no avail, and a serious illness.\n\nWith the new loan requested, she will engage in gardening by cultivating vegetables and ginger, buy chicks for her poultry farm, buy feed for the chicks, and other articles. This business will succeed because she has good soil for gardening and the droppings from the chicks will also serve as manure in the less fertile areas. She has ready customers who will buy the output. The community will benefit from some of the droppings from the chicks as vegetables will be sold to them at moderate prices.\n\nProfit from the business will be used for expansion of her poultry farm, education of her children in school, and furnishing of her house.  The GHAPE loan is preferable because of its low interest rate, convenient repayment intervals and no collateral required before loan disbursement.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.25,"image":{"id":1326696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chicks, chick feed, vegetable seedlings and other articles for her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Bafut, NW.
