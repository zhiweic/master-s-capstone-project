He grows early vegetables, tomatoes, and radishes. He owns a large plot of land, where he maintains three large greenhouses and two other greenhouses for transplanting. \r\n\r\nThanks to his previous Kiva loan, Vasiliy was well prepared for his season and made a good profit. He invested a part of the profit in his business by purchasing a boiler for heating his greenhouse. Now he needs some additional funds to purchase and install pipes for the heating system and to purchase a motor. \r\n\r\nVasiliy's 4-year-old granddaughter recently underwent an operation.

Merenziana has requested a loan of 400 USD to buy additional chicks and feed. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to improve her family's general welfare. In the future, Merenziana plans to open a shop in town for selling chickens in bulk.\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1288667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy additional chicks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Masvingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":184,"posted_date":"2013-02-09T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-11T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merenziana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyaradzo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":950,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":143.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":152.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":160.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":172.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":143.99,"local_amount":143.99,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":143.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347124880,"comment":null},{"amount":152.02,"local_amount":152.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":152.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355870925,"comment":null},{"amount":154.71,"local_amount":154.71,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":154.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364580057,"comment":null},{"amount":160.88,"local_amount":160.88,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":160.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372978658,"comment":null},{"amount":166.13,"local_amount":166.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":166.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381758965,"comment":null},{"amount":172.27,"local_amount":172.27,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":172.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390622854,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-12T15:15:43Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:26:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525820,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is aged 34 years and a farmer in Kitale county, Kenya.

He is married and has five children who stay with him.  Out of the five children, three are school-going.  He is also looking after one orphan at home.\r\n\r\nElisha is involved in the buying and selling of agricultural products, mainly coffee, ground nuts and beans, as a major source of income to look after the family.  He started this business in 2008 after failing to get formal employment.\r\n\r\nElisha requested a loan of 2,000,000 shillings to add into his agricultural trade business to buy ground nuts, coffee and beans, since the season is on.

She is requesting this loan to buy animals such as cows. She estimates that with cows, she will be able to sell milk and curds. This way she will be able to yield better earnings to provide maintenance for her lands for harvesting. Her goal is to obtain a better production and better quality of her products to sell them at a better price.

She makes a living selling seafood, such as crabs, shrimp, and fish, among others. \r\n\r\nShe has been in this business for several years, which has given her sales experience that allows her to obtain the best income. Her business is in a strategic location which is good for business, because many people walk around the area. She is very well-known because her seafood is of the best quality and she offers accessible prices. Her service is also excellent.\r\n\r\nRosenda is an enterprising woman with many goals to achieve. She works every day to earn her daily bread, and she knows that with effort and dedication she will achieve success. In recent months, her demand has doubled, which gave her the drive to grow her small business. \r\n\r\nShe needs to invest in supplies, but she does not have sufficient capital to do so. Therefore, she has applied for a loan from INTEGRAL which will allow her to buy wholesale seafood, etc. Rosenda Candelaria has creditworthiness and impeccable morals. She guarantees that she will be able to clear her debt while offering her family a better quality of

After completing secondary school, he enrolled into the Kapan Technical College for Building Construction Technology. At present he works as a construction worker for a construction company in Kapan. Lernik is married and has one son and one daughter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to working in construction, Lernik raises animals and grows produce in his native village, where he owns a land plot. He has been in this business for almost 20 years. On his farm, he keeps cattle, pigs, chickens, and sheep.\r\n\r\nOf course, after hard work in construction, it is difficult to take care of the farm as well, and so Lernik\u2019s wife and children help him out with farm work. Lernik and his wife sell vegetables, fruits, milk, meat products and cheese at the Kapan markets all year round. The revenues from farming allow him to provide for his family in a dignified way. Lernik decided to expand his farm, for which he needs a loan in the amount of 700,000 AMD to buy two bulls as well as hay for his cattle.

is a 39-year-old Lebanese married man. He lives with his wife and three school-aged children at their modest house located in one of the beautiful Lebanese villages. Fadi has spent the last sixteen years installing home electricity. He\u2019s the only one covering the family expenses. \r\n\r\nFadi always wanted to better develop his business and improve his work, but till now he earns a barely fair income, for that reason he decided to take a loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l to purchase the needed electrical equipment for his business.

The extra funds from the loan will be added to her savings to expand her agricultural business. Her future plan in five years time is to open a cereals shop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1291397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy tea tree seedlings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nanyuki","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":203,"posted_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-13T08:00:13Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31314,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":37,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7829},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":7829},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7829},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":7827}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-02-11T13:12:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525427,"name":"Reem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Reem is a conservative person, she asked her mother to take her place in the photo instead.\nReem has recently turned 18 years old.

This is not only a family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and meats costs less than raw food. Fe's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales everyday.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, Fe is requesting a Php10,000 loan.

She and her husband have two wonderful children. Baktygul has a high education and has a very happy and cheerful, positive personality. Since 1990 she has been doing animal husbandry and field crop cultivation, a business which she started with 20,000 KGS by buying one cow. Additionally Baktygul sometimes brings in clothing from Bishkek and sells to the stores. Thanks to her hard work Baktygul now has two milk cows, two calves and two horses in her livestock. Her monthly income from animal husbandry is 10,000 KGS. With the goal to grow her business she has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow and fodder. By that she can increase her income from the dairy business. Baktygul plans to invest the income from the loan into further increase of the headcount of livestock and build a house for her

Breads and spreads are staples in the usual Filipino cuisine, and are used mostly for breakfast and snacks. The most popular type of bread is the Pandesal, a Filipino version of the Spanish Pan de Sal or salted bread. It is baked during the wee hours of the morning and sold steaming hot to early commuters, students and workers. Her store is located adjacent to her house, and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales everyday.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 35,000 loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. She will also use the money for the maintenance of her oven. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. <p>\r\n\r\nLilibeth dreams that her business will expand even more and hopes to have a good and happy family.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<p>\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
