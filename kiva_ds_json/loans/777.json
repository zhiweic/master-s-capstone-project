She is married and has 3 children aged 22, 18, and 15 years.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Zainab established her raw fish business. She began her business just to enable her to take care of her children as a single parent and that is her only source of livelihood. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 900,000 SLL every month from this business.\r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL.  Zainab requires a new loan in order to buy raw fish. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 350,000 SLL.

He will use the 3000 new sols to buy a cargo motorcycle so that he can transport his sacks of produce more easily.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":992733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cargo motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-28T21:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-27T21:20:11Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isidro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":455.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":478.18},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":489.56},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":509.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":524.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":542.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":170.81,"local_amount":455.49,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":459.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386368,"comment":null},{"amount":179.32,"local_amount":478.18,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:14Z","rounded_local_amount":482.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099463,"comment":null},{"amount":374.57,"local_amount":998.87,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202495,"comment":null},{"amount":196.78,"local_amount":524.73,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":529.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098180,"comment":null},{"amount":203.52,"local_amount":542.73,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":547.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400987,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T01:51:56Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":386128,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita is 76 years old and a widow with three children.

She lives in her own house along with her partner, Ren\u00e1n, who is 41 years old, and their three beloved children, to whom she wants to offer a better quality of life. Maura is a profit-making woman. She works with great conscientiousness to plow the land to then grow cacao plants, work that she has been doing for more than 35 years. She does this in addition to taking care of her parents, since they are elderly and need attention. Maura, with the help of her partner, can carry out this work on her farm because thanks to it, they can pay for the family expenses. At harvest time, she can count on the help of her children and day laborers. This way she can extract the fruits rapidly to then offer the harvest to the cooperatives in her district. Nevertheless, it is difficult for her to transport her sacks of harvested cacao to the cooperative centers.

More than just a haircut, Jonnys offers his clients for 10 hours a day and sometimes more, self-improvement services that his friends, neighbors, and the general public take advantage of.\r\nEven though competition is high, he sustains by the quality he provides, his low prices, and complete customer satisfaction.  Financial statements demonstrate characteristics of small business: primary investments are on fixed assets which creates liquidity for these types of businesses.

Over this time, she has been able to gain good buyers.  She sells her corn to Vivero Los Incas, which exports the corn that she produces, and sells her potato harvests to a company that makes fries.  In parallel with this work, she also raises bulls and hens which she consumes and sells when people request them.

She is an entrepreneur and runs a small company with much growth potential.  She was born in Barranquilla which gave her a free, cheerful spirit that captivates the people around her.  Her father being \"Antioque\u00f1o\" and her mother \"Santandereana\", has given her a determined character and disciplined working habits, which she uses to run her store.  She started her business in 2010 with her mother's advice.  Daniela has strengthened the business with the marketing expertise she learned through corporate sales and marketing training.\r\n\r\nIn her store, Daniela not only sells groceries, canned goods, liquors, meats, eggs, etc., but also has a main goal of being able to meet all the needs of the typical shopping basket for all the families who live nearby.  Housewives and neighbors meet at her store to share time together.  They pay in cash but sometimes receive short-term credit terms.  Daniela wants to study social communication and her greatest challenge is having the income, through her store, to do so.  Daniela's accounts receivable turnover is two days, and her inventory turnover is 15 days.  These are the financial indicators she uses for company growth.  She will use the Credikiva loan, her first through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy groceries, canned goods, liquors, wholesale, so she can obtain better discounts and payment terms in the market so she can meet her goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":992940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy groceries, canned food, and liquors wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-29T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-28T13:00:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77412},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84492},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86463},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88481},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90545},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92658},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94820},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97032},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99296},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101613},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103984},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113204}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":89.55,"local_amount":161904,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":162262.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039193,"comment":null},{"amount":47.82,"local_amount":86463,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":86654.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651324,"comment":null},{"amount":48.94,"local_amount":88481,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":88676.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140931,"comment":null},{"amount":50.08,"local_amount":90545,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":90745.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100825,"comment":null},{"amount":51.25,"local_amount":92658,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":92863,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338450,"comment":null},{"amount":52.44,"local_amount":94820,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":95029.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395020,"comment":null},{"amount":53.67,"local_amount":97032,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":97246.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386832,"comment":null},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":418097,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":419021.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993714,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T21:16:20Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385571,"name":"Miryan Maricela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miryan de 22 a\u00f1os, es una mujer trabajadora que comenz\u00f3 como vendedora de cosm\u00e9ticos y joyas para poder ayudar con los gastos familiares ya que tiene 4 hijos. \n\nComenz\u00f3 a vender cosm\u00e9ticos desde las 08h00am para mejorar sus ingresos.

She lives together with her son Maycol who she looks after in her own home, which is located in the town of Chilca.  Her courage is admirable as she brought up her three children on her own.  Two of her children are now living independently.  They have their own families and always look out for their mother.  Evarista continues caring for her remaining child who she loves very much.  For this reason, every day from Monday to Friday she works in a mine in the high area of the city.  There she mines gold, silver and copper, and earns a good wage for it.  This allows her to cover her expenses.  She tells us that she often pans the waste products which are thrown out of the mine and extracts small nuggets which she sells to jewelry stores in the city.  This makes her extra money.  However, as she doesn't always have this income, she started a small business buying sheep and grain which she sells in the country's capital city on the weekend when she has a break from her job.\r\n\r\nEvarista belongs to the \"Chilca' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support as it will make her feel secure in making progress in her business.  For her part, she pledges to make her repayments on time.  Evarista enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.

She lives together with Eder, her husband of 7 years.  The couple have two children, Mariangel and Farid, who they care for in their own home.  Their home is located in the town of Hualahoyo.  Magaly's main job is making bricks.  She carries out this work together with her husband.  Her job consists of preparing the molds which are then fired in the oven.  She says that she makes 25 thousand bricks a month and sells them to a well-known supplier who always visits her factory.  However, when she obtains a better offer, she goes to the country's capital city to sell her bricks.  Alongside this work, Magaly also grows corn and potatoes in partnership with a lady who owns farmland.  They share expenses and, when harvest time comes, they divide the profits.  She sells the crops that she grows in the capital, where she also takes vegetables to sell in the wholesale market.  Right now, Magaly would like to put together some money to buy a truck.\r\n\r\nMagaly is a member of the \"Barrio Oriental\" community bank and this is her thirteenth loan from MFP.

He has been working there for one year. In addition to working at the library, Jonius also cultivates vegetables: cucumbers, cassava, papayas, cashews, corn, peanuts and string beans at their farm in his spare time. Jonius is assisted by his wife, Feronika, in taking care their farm and selling the crops as well while he is at the library.\r\n \r\nJonius is thinking to improve his business; he wants to buy seedlings, fertilizer, and pesticides. In addition, Jonius wants to buy firewood to resell at the market. This situation led him to request a loan amounting to IDR 5,000,000 from TLM for his business improvement.

He lives with his wife, Ani, and their daughter, Maricielo--who they dearly love--in a rented house in Chilca.  Carlos was born in the city of Huancayo, but his parents are from the country and he\u2019s proud of them for that.  Carlos has always worked hard.  His plan is to build a small house on a plot of land in the city, left to him by his mother.  He started his taxi business to raise the money he needs.  He drives the route between Huancayo and the city of Huancavelica, a trip that he makes once or twice [a day, a week?\u2014not clear] and he\u2019s happy with his earnings from the business.  His wife has a crafts business, turning wire and thread into human figures.  She makes around a thousand of the figures a day and is well paid for her work.  Carlos wants to drive larger buses, but he needs a new set of licensing and it\u2019s expensive to get.  He could earn a lot more with it, though, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s applying for this loan.   He belongs to the Chila community bank and this is his first MFP loan.  He was pleased to learn about this means of financing because the money will allow him to grow his business.  He, in turn, agrees to repay the loan in the agreed-upon time.  He likes his community bank because the members are responsible and supportive.  Carlos, upon receiving your loan, will pay for the licensing he needs to grow his taxi business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":992988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to get required licensing for his taxi business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-29T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-28T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401007,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-01T02:00:32Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":386291,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is a 45-year-old lady from Kisumu City, situated along the shores of Lake Victoria.

Her only responsibility is to keep her parents calm, for which she works without rest buying and selling young sheep, which is her specialty.\r\n\r\nHer job consists of traveling to the altitude at which they raise the animals, to buy large quantities from the ranchers.  She herself transports them to the city where she sells them at the various markets in the valley.  Her job is going very well for her, for which she feels fulfilled because she started this job when she was very young.  Every year she gets better customers and, as a result, better profits.

She really likes what she does, as it provides her time to to care for her household and take care of some tasks that she needs to attend to while running her businesses. At the beginning, she had many difficulties learning everything related to the business. Moreover, she was lacking capital to invest in her business.
