He is 33 years old and lives with his wife, parents and grandmother. Temuri has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for the family business start-up but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is a monthly pension of Temuri\u2019s father and grandmother as well as a small income earned by Temuri working as an auto mechanic locally. Besides that, the family owns a milk cow and produces dairy products with the received milk. The income is hardly enough for food for a five member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTemuri requested a loan from Credo to start up the family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor that do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Temuri will set up his auto repair workshop in Kutaisi (the nearby town). He will rent the building and serve the local drivers. Temuri will get a service fee, and the new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

However, one of the grounds of constant concerns is that next to one of her plots a river circulates, as it is very beneficial to her crops.\r\n\r\nBeing in the middle stage of the maintenance of cocoa trees, she believes she should give it all her attention, because the quality of the grains will determine the marketing of it, which is why she needs sufficient organic compost as well as sufficient capital in order to contract to manage the weeding.\r\n\r\nIn the future she plans to construct a house of concrete and bricks to fulfill the urge to complete one of her dreams of a planned inheritance for her grandchildren. She has had seven loans and has a good credit history permitting her work to go smoothly. She is an attentive person at the meetings of her communal bank. With the 1,000 [soles] she will buy bags of organic compost as well as contract laborers to weed the crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1232617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

The loan will be used to buy building materials for the expansion of her shop. With a budget of 1,700 INR, she will purchase roof sheet\/tin sheet and use the remaining 3,300 INR to purchase women's garments, such as tops, lingerie and footwear.\r\n\r\nIn order to save more, Paokenwiliu works in a homestead garden where she grows vegetables such as cabbage, mustard leaves, corn, coriander, spring onions and ginger for her family's consumption to reduce buying meals. She dreams of supporting her son (8 months) through to higher education without any financial constraint.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of her group members are keen on expanding their businesses. Two of the members supply Paokenwiliu with clothes, and one member wishes to expand her piggery farm by bringing in more piglets. One wishes to open a yarn store. Two other members jointly opened a tea stall \u2013 the only tea stall in the village \u2013 where they serve up to 100 customers a day. With the loan, they wish to expand the tea stall aiming to accommodate more customers and keep more menus for the customers. In these ways, the group, with their respective businesses, collectively wishes to improve their lives by focusing on their children's education, so that they may have a better future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1232321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy building materials and ladies garments for the expansion of her clothing store.

She grows tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes in greenhouses.  She has four large greenhouses, as well as greenhouses for seedlings.  She has been in this line of work for about 16 years.

She lives with her partner and has two children who are 21 and 19 years old.  She is currently very happy to be expecting her third child.  She lives with her husband and their two children in their own home, which they were able to build through a lot of work.  Karina's business is selling food, local dishes and roast meats like chicken, pig and fish.  To do this, she set up a table in the front area of her house where she gives friendly and cordial service to her customers.  She has been in this business for four years, and her daughter helps her to prepare the stews and serve the customers.  The majority of her customers are her neighbors and passersby.  In addition, three months ago Karina was able to purchase a taxi, which her husband uses for work.  And so they are able to meet their household expenses.  Karina likes her business, as it affords her an income that meets the household expenses and her children's needs.  Her children are her motivation to continue progressing.  On the other hand, she doesn't like when the prices of her supplies go up, as it results in an income reduction.  But even so, she finds a way to make her sales profitable.

She will use the benefits from this loan to improve her system of seed trays, which is a method of planting resulting from the germination and development of a botanical or vegetative seed, growing in cells of a tray in a sterilized artifical substrate, over a specific period of time, in order to be transplanted to its final location in the soil, depending on the type of plant.

She works a lot.  What she wishes for most is to be able to offer a better quality of life to her young daughter and to strengthen herself economically.   Consuelo makes a living selling chickens.  \r\n\r\nShe has a stall in one of the busiest markets.  Fortunately, she has good sales and considerable profits since her work place is well-located on a corner quite visible to the street.  But this work takes a lot of sacrifice in order to obtain good and fresh products that she offers to her customers.  She has to wake up at dawn to go to the chicken supplier to get ahead of other sellers that compete in her same area.  \r\n\r\nShe knows that all her effort is worth the difficulty and is rewarded to see that her small daughter has everything necessary to be comfortable.  She has been working in this business for more than four years.  She works alone and says that her desire to do things well and to generate economic income for her family are her main motives to go in search of further progress.\r\n\r\nShe likes the freedom that this work offers her; she can have fun during the afternoons, playing and practicing sports, and being with her family.  She hopes to continue working in order to continue growing her business.  \r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP.  She was always a good member within her group, where they loved her for being very responsible and supportive.  She is thankful to those that have offered her the loan she requires to continue growing her business.  She is convinced that she will continue to be a very punctual client and she will pay her installments on time, like she has done with all the other loans she has had so far.\r\n\r\nThe amount she is requesting (3500 PEN) she will invest in buying more chickens of the best species and sizes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1232738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy chickens.

She also has entered into the business of buying and selling lumber due to the profitability that that sector generates. She works with her son in law's help. He knows about the development of this activity more than she does. Meanwhile. during the time that she does her sewing work she is always working for the best way to do the work since many times the pressure from the customers made her feel like she wasn't going to be able to complete her tasks efficiently. Nonetheless, she faces the adversity and now she has plans to expand her business. She knows that the way to do it is long and at this time she wants to keep it as a long term goal. Now she will prepare to sew her own designs and sell them, since she already has orders from her customers. This is her third individual loan with the MFP institution.

lives in the Kitale area of Kenya, which is an area with high poultry production and consumption. She has three children and has been doing this work for four years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, job salary, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"Apart from providing food for the family, it provides income too.\" She describes her biggest challenge: \"During planting season the price of inputs is high.\" Animals on the farm have been given the names of Grace and Serey. She will use the loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nMaria was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"It is the only microfinance institution providing asset finance to farmers in my area.\" This client was also asked what she learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session. She replied, \"To invest productive assets.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

She devotes all her love and effort to her 5 year old son, Marco. Her partner, Filomeno, has been her unconditional, life-long support. They live in a wooden house where they plan to lay concrete in the future. Because of a bad moment she went through once, she decided to seek for a economic activity. She moved to the jungle and, using a lot inherited from her parents, she was able to grow coffee and consolidate her business with her husband's support. One of her favorite things about her activity is to see how her lots become increasingly productive and how the coffee beans are well paid by the buyers in bulk to which she sells her products.

This group was formed in the year 2008 by four women members of the Below Poverty Line category from the village Torli in the district of Nuapada in Odisha, India. Nuapada district is one of the poorest districts in India. \n\nSantoshini is one of the members of this group. She is standing second from left in the photo. She is very shy by nature but has a strong determination for the development of her family. She is 35 years old, living with her husband, one baby son and three daughters, ages 10, 7 and 3 years old. Her two daughters are attending school in the same village. She has a little patch of land where her husband cultivates vegetables. \n\nSantoshini is running a milk business with three cows. She purchased two cows \u2013 one from each of two previous loans from Mahashakti Foundation. Santoshini is getting 15 liters of milk per day. Her husband supplies this milk to a Tiffin hotel in a nearby town. Her family earns 5,000 Indian rupees (INR) per month from the present milk business. To maintain a family of six members along with maintenance of the cows, the present income is insufficient, and Santoshini is facing lots of financial trouble. So, as there is growing demand for milk in the locality, she has planned to utilize the present loan for purchasing another cow of improved variety to add some extra income for her family. \n\nSantoshini is very much thankful to Mahashakti Foundation for her growth. She says this will help her to earn some extra income and save some money to provide better education for her children. Santoshini also has a dream of developing a dairy farm in the future and constructing a cow shed.\n\nThe other three members of this group are Sabitri, Sabita and Lochana. They run a cloth business, electrical motor winding center and grocery shop.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for purchasing a cow of improved variety.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Torli,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-12T11:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-12T11:10:02Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santoshini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lochana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":104000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":104000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T01:48:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":491405,"name":"Rosalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalyn is a 27-year-old married woman from Albur, Bohol.

This is the reason why the family members cooperate together, hoping to enhance their status financially. \r\n\r\nOne of Ahmad\u2019s greatest dreams is to be able to cover his university fees. He works at a local company, and still, his salary does not cover his study fees. To help him continue paying his education fees, he\u2019s asking to take a youth loan from Kiva Partner Ameen s.a.l. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he will achieve a good educational level, even pursue higher degrees. With this education, he will start his own business and no doubt a new and better way of living.

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is married with three children, all of whom attend school. She is not looking after any additional family members.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years, Nora has been making snacks for sale at retail, working six days a week. She does not have an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of UGX 250,000 from MCDT- SACCO to enable her to buy ingredients such as Irish potatoes and cooking oil.

is married with three children, two of whom attend school. She lives in Kampala, Uganda, and does not look after any additional family members. For the past five years, Janat has sold charcoal at the local market. She works seven days a week and does not earn any additional income. She rents a house with both electricity and running water and her major monthly expense is rent. Janat's business challenges include seasonality of supply and transportation.

Currently 29 years old, Adrian grew tired of the restaurant industry and decided he needed a career change.\r\n\r\nIn May 2012, Adrian entered the carpet cleaning industry. He says his family has always been in this industry. His grandpa and two of his uncles had different businesses in the field, so since he was a child, he has always been around it, learning everything he needs to do a good job. \r\n\r\nAt Deep Clean Carpet Cleaners, located in his hometown of El Paso, Adrian says, \u201cWe do the best service at the best price.\u201d \r\n\r\nThat service consists of not just carpet cleaning, but car interior and upholstery cleaning as well. He says his customer service, performance and chemicals and machine used set him apart from competitors. Adrian uses a truck mount, which is a carpet cleaning machine that uses hypoallergenic, biodegradable enzymes instead of shampoos to clean and also extracts water. \r\n\r\nAfter visiting the El Paso Small Business Development Center for business support, Adrian was introduced to Accion Texas Inc., then decided to apply for a loan with Accion. Upon approval, Adrian purchased a Prochem truck mount, which he says will help the vitality of his business as it will do a better job. Because of the loan, Adrian said, \u201cI\u2019m ready to compete with major companies at a local price.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy next year, Adrian expects to have a second cleaning unit and create jobs for at

who is originally from Mexico City, is targeting the Hispanic community via Community Auto Insurance, an independent company that works with unlicensed and international-licensed drivers with not-so-perfect credit and\/or driving records. Community Auto Insurance also provides notary public services, Spanish translations and income tax preparation. \u201cI\u2019m here to service my community and help them in any way I can,\u201d he says. \r\n\r\nThough Cesar currently works alone at his office in Garland, Texas, he plans to hire a staff to meet higher demand during the tax and insurance season. He says once people receive their income tax refunds, many tend to purchase cars, which leads to an increase in the purchase of auto insurance policies. \r\n\r\nBefore he entered the insurance industry five years ago, Cesar had a lot of friends who were already insurance agents, and from their stories, he found there is a large profit margin as an independent insurance broker, or a third-party insurance agent, who works with multiple insurance companies to offer the best policy and price for his customers.  \r\n\r\n\u201cI always knew there was money to be made,\u201d he says. \u201cI just had to wait for the right time.\u201d \r\n\r\nBefore going on his own, Cesar was laid off from a full-time job when his employer decided to downsize the company and invest in a management system. He says he was \u201calmost forced\u201d into becoming an entrepreneur. Cesar says losing his job coincided with his discovery of Accion Texas Inc. during a Google search. This ultimately led to making a decision to pursue his dream of self-employment as an insurance broker.  \r\n\r\nHe applied for a loan and was approved. \u201cThe dream of opening my own industry has been one for three years,\u201d he says. \u201cI submitted my goals to banks for the last three years. No one but Accion would help.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe loan provided immediate funds to start the business. Without a loan, Cesar says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I couldn\u2019t start it, but it would have been slow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Accion loan went to start-up costs, Cesar says. Those included renovating a store front, advertising, office furniture, insurance, purchasing a printer and computer equipped with software for tax, policy management and competitive insurance rating, notary public applications, and store signs.

Sopio requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up but without success.  Her loan request was rejected because of low income and the family's poor living conditions.  The family runs a small-scale agricultural business.  They grow different kinds of vegetables on a family-owned plot of land.  Besides that, Sopio runs a small dairy farm of a calf and two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products, which are sold at the local open market.  In addition, Sopio works as a baker and her husband serves as a daily worker to the local farmers to earn a small monthly income.  Their income is hardly enough to feed the six-member family.  \r\n\r\nSopio requested a loan from Credo to start up a trade business.  Her loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program provides credit with soft conditions extended to the country's rural poor.  They do not have access to mainstream credit because they are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" due to low income.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Sopio will purchase different kinds of household goods and dishes at wholesale markets and sell them in her village with a price mark-up.  She will take her goods to the local houses.  In time, she will gain loyal customers and increase sales.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly increase the income of the family.  Sopio will work hard and she will be able to improve the living conditions of herself and her family members.

is married and has five children, and she lives in a three-room house in Bamenda, a part of Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. The major challenge she has faced was being sick in the hospital for months, with no money to pay hospital bills or purchase drugs in the pharmacy. During that time she also lost her mother and father, so nobody was there to care for her in the hospital. \n\nThis lady joined GHAPE in the year 2012 and has managed, and successfully repaid, one loan. With the new loan requested, she will rent a piece land for farming, buy farming seedlings like maize, beans, yams, and cassava, plus fertilizer. She will buy good improved seedlings for her farming so as to have good yields. Also she intends to keep chicks, when they are six weeks she resells them. With this farming business activity, the community will have a regular supply of farm products like maize, beans and yams, at moderate prices.\n\nShe holds a positive view on this business to succeed, because she sells good food, and the entire locality knows her for that, because she sells at a very moderate price, and because her business environment is also neat thus encouraging people to buy from her. \n\nWith the profit from the loan, she will work with her husband to educate the children, to cater for family needs, and to build a more comfortable house. She prefers a loan from GHAPE  because  of its low interest rate and convenient repayment intervals, and because members are educated on loan and business management before the loans are disbursed.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1230661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Nelson sells crafts for a living and has been in business for six years.

They live in the village of Niazekan in the region of Segou (4th administrative region of Mali) and know each other through neighborhood ties, professional activities, and kinship. They practice in the buying and selling of all kinds of condiments, cereals, soaps and various other goods. \n\nWith the goal of satisfying the needs of their customers, who are more and more numerous and demanding, the members of the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program. This is the first group loan.\n\nChata Solo (the first woman standing in the photo with the red scarf) excels in the selling of soap. She is very sought after in the business.

At her young age with help from her spouse she\u2019s managed to build her house with substantial materials as proof that she can reach many future goals.  Very united to Frank who works as an artist and musician, they came up with the idea of acquiring sound equipment to lease for social events and town patron saint festivals and others; they discovered a great market and constant work.  They started the business nine years ago with some money their parents lent them and they gradually equipped it with the purchase of more sound consoles thus becoming established in the line of work.\r\n\r\nOne of the plusses of the work is that it\u2019s generally weekend work which gives both of them time to share their child together especially during the week.  However, among the work\u2019s minuses is rain that occurs and can damage their equipment.   On the other hand, however, demand for their equipment is constant to such an extent that they are unable to respond to all the events which causes lost opportunities for earning more money.  This is why they need to buy more sound equipment to be able to take advantage of all the work opportunities that will be coming up this time of year.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s had 15 loans and she is profoundly grateful for the constant trust MFP has placed in her.  She\u2019s totally in favor of her communal bank because she considers it to be a solid group.

Joan is 23 years old and lives in the town of Mukono, which is in the Mukono region of Uganda. For the past two years, Joan has been working hard to manage her business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Joan has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale and will help Joan generate greater profits. She will use the savings to look after the family. Joan hopes that in the future she will be able to make larger profits. \r\n\r\nJoan is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for training in

All of us learn to craft jewelry from the time we are in school. In 2009, my parents were named 'The Master's Hands' for gold and silver jewelry by The Jakarta Post. They taught me to learn patiently, work hard and never give up to achieve good jewelry. I will be a good jewelry maker like my parents and my brother, and I will make them proud of me. My husband is also a silversmith and this is part of my happiness in life, making my life worthwhile. I hope you like my jewelry and feel its beauty.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to send my deepest thanks to all of you for this microcredit.

She came to Nairobi from Kenya's Western Province with her husband in 2009. Like many who come to Nairobi, they were searching for work. With their two young children (Acomfort and Barnabas) in tow, they saw an opportunity to prevent the youths in their new neighborhood from remaining idle and resorting to crime. Taking \"chokoras\" (troubled children) off the streets and into their classrooms at the Shalom Academy, Emily and her husband began to see the results in their community. The school has grown from 10 students to 150 in the last three years. Her husband is now going through teacher training, and they plan to continue reshaping the futures of their students.\r\n\r\nWith her Fresh Life toilet business, Emily hopes to clean up the area near her school. Children in the community are under great threat from the diseases spread by people relieving themselves in nearby bushes.

I run my own shop in a town that lies at our beautiful Zambezi's Barotse floodplain.\r\n\r\n\"I started out as a sugar sales boy. I would go to the Mongu depot to buy sugar and bring it back to my village to sell. I then managed to raise some capital and opened my sugar shop. Then in 2009, I got the opportunity to become a Zoona mobile money transfer agent. From the time I started offering money transfers in my sugar shop, my business improved because of the commissions I earned after every transaction. I love providing the service to the people. I feel that a business is incomplete without good customer service to make my clients come back.\r\n\r\n\"Even though my business has improved, I still face the challenge of not having enough money for my business.

I run a shop in my hometown of Kazungula. My shop deals in mobile money transfers and stationery supplies.\r\n\r\nMike Quinn, who is now the CEO at Zoona, introduced me to the business of Mobile money transfers back in the year 2009. I started the business with a capital of about $500. Today, my working capital has increased to $2000. I have seen the growth and I am very proud of the business. \r\n\r\nAs Kazungula is a border town, my customers are mostly truck drivers who send money to their families. I also have a lot of businessmen who come to get their cars at the border, and have to pay duty. I have to send some of them away because at the moment, my working capital is only $2000 and they normally need to receive huge sums of money. This makes me sad because I lose out on a lot of profit.\r\n\r\nWhen I get the Kiva loan, my working capital will increase and I will not have to send too many people away. The loan will also help me to keep the stationery stock levels high.\r\n\r\nI am very grateful for the chance to be on Kiva because it is very difficult to get a loan in Zambia. I know this will improve my family\u2019s standard of living. I look forward to getting another Kiva loan once I finish paying this one.

As a result of their love they have their 23-year-old daughter Cesia, and they work together so that they can achieve a better future. They currently live in a rented house. She first started selling fuel in a gas station owned by her sister. When her sister found other business opportunities, she decided to rent out the station. That's why she has been selling fuel oil to local motorcycle taxi drivers and larger vehicles for the past year. She gets support from her daughter who helps her occasionally. She also sells gas cylinders, a business that earns her very good profits. However, sometimes she's left undersupplied when there's a delay with the tankers from her wholesale suppliers. Since she's facing an increase in the gas cylinder sales, she wishes to buy them in bulk in order to obtain better profits. In addition, she wishes to buy fuel. She hopes to someday own her own gas station, thus she wishes to buy her own machinery and search for an appropriate venue. This is her 18th loan. She expresses her deep gratitude because thanks to the loans she's able to fufill her financial obligations with ease and serenity. She enjoys the fact that she's part of a communal bank whose members are always optimistic as well as punctual with their repayments. With the 2000 nuevos soles she'll purchase gas cylinders and more fuel."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1233354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase fuel and gas cylinders.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-12T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-12T20:40:06Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":199.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":222.18},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":244.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":252.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":251.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":269.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":278.12},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":281.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.28,"local_amount":199.44,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":201.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188789,"comment":null},{"amount":86.1,"local_amount":222.18,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":224.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572689,"comment":null},{"amount":94.78,"local_amount":244.61,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":247.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122355,"comment":null},{"amount":97.91,"local_amount":252.66,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":255.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868173,"comment":null},{"amount":97.61,"local_amount":251.9,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":254.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576993,"comment":null},{"amount":104.34,"local_amount":269.26,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":271.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529317,"comment":null},{"amount":107.77,"local_amount":278.12,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":280.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974445,"comment":null},{"amount":109.21,"local_amount":281.83,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":284.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995881,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-24T18:02:12Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":488747,"name":"Florah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florah is 41 years old and a mother of three children aged 16, 15 and three and half.

Together they make up a large family, with the care and affection that can only be given by hardworking parents who are full of dreams. She currently has a house made of good materials, built with the help of her relatives. \r\n\r\nShe works in one of the most consistent and productive activities in the region, coffee bean production. She has been developing her business for four years with good momentum, counting on the support of Francisco. She also calls on her children occasionally to help with minor activities.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys working with coffee plantations because one of the most simple processes is the harvest. Nevertheless, maintaining and planting the plantation requires patient, collective labor, as this is the only way to obtain good quality beans which are valued well by middlemen.\r\n\r\nShe is currently experiencing a good season, so she should take advantage of this period to plant and fertilize the coffee. However, she will be waiting for several months for the harvest of these beans, and during that time she would like to take up something else, such as sales. Therefore, she would like to open a grocery store in her town. This would help her to earn additional income.\r\n\r\nShe has taken out 17 loans with MFP. As a person with plenty of experience with loans, she has been on time with her payments, since she would like to take out a greater loan in the future. She enjoys working with her communal bank very much, because the members are trustworthy and respectful people.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 3,000 Peruvian nuevos soles, she will be able to hire day laborers to begin the coffee planting season. She will also be able to buy more coffee plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1233375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy coffee plants and hire day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-12T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-12T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":210.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":234.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":229.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":249.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":258.19},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":259.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":275.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":281.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.75,"local_amount":210.96,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":213.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188790,"comment":null},{"amount":90.94,"local_amount":234.7,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":237.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572690,"comment":null},{"amount":88.88,"local_amount":229.37,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":231.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122356,"comment":null},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":249.97,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":252.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868174,"comment":null},{"amount":100.05,"local_amount":258.19,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":260.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576994,"comment":null},{"amount":100.68,"local_amount":259.83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":262.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529318,"comment":null},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":275.24,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":277.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974446,"comment":null},{"amount":109.17,"local_amount":281.74,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":284.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995882,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-13T20:57:54Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":494727,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The word \"honor\" best describes Mrs. Wilma.

Purevjil is a 50-year-old man living with his family in their small wooden house in Kherlen, the third largest city in Mongolia. He built his house with wood many years ago. Because the house is old and has thin walls, his family uses a large amount of charcoal to heat their house compared with other households in the area. <p>\r\n\r\nSince 2003 he has been working as a taxi-driver; his wife doesn\u2019t have a job. During the winter months, he sometimes goes to the countryside to buy meat from herders, which he sells at a local market for profits. Purevjil explains that he cares for his car as if the car was a member of his family, in large part because it is the only piece of equipment they own which brings income to their family. His family would face many challenges if the car were to break down. <p>\r\n\r\nStarting this year, he needs to earn more income because his older son will begin his studies at a university located in Ulaanbaatar, the capital. Plus, his younger son studies at a local school. <p>\r\n\r\nTherefore, Purevijl is seeking a loan, before the winter begins, to work on his house and to better protect his car from the elements. Specifically, Purevjil is planning to use the loan proceeds to thicken his house's walls and to build a garage for his car. He would build the garage on one side of the house, which ought to cut down on his family's charcoal usage (and prevent or at least delay the car\u2019s breakdown). By taking these steps, he will be able to improve his family's living
