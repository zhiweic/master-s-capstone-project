Nuraini is a widow. She is a mother of three children. Her children already finish school and have  jobs. She has been selling cosmetics for two and half years. Her business is going well. She can add more cosmetics step by step. This is her second loan with VisionFund Indonesia. She wants to use it to buy different brands of cosmetics. She likes to do this business because cosmetics are durable and easy to sell. One problem that she usually faces is when it is raining, she needs to close her kiosk. That is why, in the future, she wants to have her own shop. So even though it is raining, she still can open her shop.\r\n\r\nOther group members will use their part of the loan to improve their businesses such as selling vegetables and nasi uduk (Indonesian coconut rice).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":972736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

In this region, farming is one of the most common activities that residents engage in.  He works 12 hours daily approximately while his wife tends to the home and the children.  Edison tells us that one of the obstacles he faces is living in a zone that lacks roads so getting his products to market is difficult.  He comments that the community has been asking for years for a bridge to be built that will facilitate access to the center of the canton that\u2019s the commercial zone.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019d like to invest in the purchase of piglets to raise for subsequent resale.

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, which is approximately four hours south of Lima, the country's capital, and hailed by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" (\"Land of the Sun\").  Ica is well known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007, and a 6.9 in 2011); its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives; and perhaps above all, as the source of Peru's traditional liquor, Pisco.  \r\n\r\nIn this hot and arid climate, one encounters the home and business of Elida Luz.  In her free time, she enjoys reading, which relaxes her a bit.  As is generally known, Peru's cuisine is one of the most delicious in the world; one of Elida's favorite dishes is \"Tallarines Rojos\" (a Peruvian style pasta in red sauce).  She only studied through the fifth year of secondary school, due to the limited economic resources of her parents.  She is married, her husband is a construction worker, and together they have two children, who are the center of her life.  \r\n\r\nElida rents construction equipment and works for about four hours per day.  She is excited to have this business, thanks to her husband, who is already familiar with this line of work.  In one day, Elida may work with six clients, which allows her to earn up to S\/.100 each day.  In a good day, she can earn up to S\/.150, which allows her to pay for expenses around the home and to re-invest in the business.  She believes that her business is going well because her equipment is in good shape and due to the good relationship that she has with her clients.     \r\n\r\nElida is very happy with her borrowers, and with this loan, she can provide them with maintenance for her equipment.  With this improvement, she will have equipment in good condition, thereby avoiding possible accidents so that, in a few months, she can save enough money in order to accomplish her great goal:  \"Expand her business\". \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":973338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","use":"To maintain equipment.

It is an exceptional place, not only because of its ethnic richness but also because of the beautiful countryside one encounters upon entering this beautiful city. Santo Domingo de los Colorados is presently part of the recently established province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. The principal festival of Santa Domingo takes place with an intense influx of visitors along with commercial and cultural exchanges. A large fair takes place on the premises of the Cattlemen\u2019s Association where the best specimens of different breeds and cross breeds raised on farms in the area are shown and compete.\r\n\r\nMonica and her husband have had a stall selling fruits and vegetables in a market in the town for 15 years. Monica\u2019s relatives did this work and then she continued it with her husband. Their work schedule is a bit strange since they work from Wednesdays to Sundays, approximately 10 hours a day. In order to secure a better price from their suppliers they need to make a relatively large purchase and their only option is to take out a loan. In this way they will be able to have a greater supply of products at a better price, enabling them to earn more income.  \r\n\r\nMonica longs to be able to continue working and to have a better quality of life. She wants to give her children the education that she herself was never able to have..   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":973957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a batch of fruits and vegetables at a better price.

She lives alone with her 17 year old son since separating from her husband some time ago.  They both live in the Santo Domingo canton.  Santo Domingo is a canton and city in the new Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province, which used to be a rural parish of Quito. Santo Domingo is between the coast and the mountain range in Ecuador, a connecting point between some important cities.  It is situated on the outer edges of the western mountains and in the lower coastal plain at 1000 meters above sea level. This area has the highest rainfall in the country. There is a great abundance of water as there are five important river basins and micro basins here. It is a rainy, subtropical zone, and the average temperature is 22 \u00b0C.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a farmer.  She learned how to do this from her family members when she was very young.  She grows products that are typical of the zone like cacao, yucca, and bananas.  Her small house is very humble.  It does not have electricity, and the floor is not in good condition.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has confided in \u201cFernando\u201d, a young credit adviser with the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, so that he will help her get a loan to fix the floor in her house.  She will also buy fertilizers and pesticides for her crops.  This way she will be able to improve her income and pay the loan.  She will also be able to receive training and counseling to overcome her poverty.\r\n\r\nThis hard-working woman dreams of having a small house with the basic services.  After the difficult separation from her husband she worries about her son, and she hopes that he will be able to complete his education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":974077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to
