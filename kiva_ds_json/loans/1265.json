In future, he would like to have a farm of sheep and cows in order to improve his living conditions. His aspiration is to provide his family with the best life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":79.57,"image":{"id":1466074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy livestock for his butcher shop in order to expand his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana`a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2013-11-17T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-16T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohammed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16751},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16659}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.57,"local_amount":16751,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":17095.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439632144,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T19:20:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631453,"name":"Adnan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adnan is a clever, skillful, and calm 28-year-old man who lives in Ibb, Yemen.

is 23 years old. Together with his mother and brother, they live in Vanadzor city, which is in the Lori region. Davit has graduated from Vanadzor State Engineering University in the faculty of Economics. Since his childhood, Davit has liked to decorate and design anything in their house. In other words, he has been a very creative person since he was just a little boy. \r\n\r\nDuring his studentship he used to attend some jewelry making courses by different famous masters, and in two years he became very skilled. He learned all the secrets and various tricks of that field.

Sadbard is planning on starting a second business in raising cattle.  She plans to raise cows, bulls, etc. for later sale.  When questioned as to why she chose this type of business, Sadbarg answered that it is stable and profitable, and she already has everything she needs:  a barn and a pasture where the cattle can graze.  \r\n\r\nSadbarg has $750 in startup capital and she is taking out the loan for the balance that she will need.  Sadbarg will use her savings and the loan to buy 5 head of cows, calves, and cattle feed.

Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\"The most important period in life for the person is the choice of future profession. Therefore, it is necessary to approach to this choice very carefully, considering all pluses and minuses, to understand whether you will be able to be engaged in the chosen business for the rest of the life. I have done my choice and decided to study in International and Business Law department. As I consider, a lawyer has to have a huge stock of merits, such as responsibility, logical thinking, persistence, confidence, good memory, initiative, emotional stability.\r\n\r\n\"It is inconceivable to imagine the worthy lawyer without the following human qualities such as fairness, honesty, justice, responsiveness, humanity, a feeling of honor, decency, respect, conscientiousness, high idea of a professional duty. It is by far not the complete list, but I believe that the main qualities were noted by me. \r\n\r\n\"Everything that I listed is close to me. For this reason I choose the profession of lawyer. Also, a legal education promotes development of the personality as it includes studying historical, public and social disciplines, which are very interesting to me.\r\n\r\n\"My profession will allow me to help people who need my help. Barriers and difficulties which will get in my way of study time and also after it attract me and give a peculiar motivation to development. I want to help people and constantly feel that I am necessary to them. \r\n\r\n\"AUCA will give me a quality education by means of which I will be able to achieve my goals. I very hope to study in AUCA, where I will learn from qualified teachers, experts of their business. I plan to increase the acquired knowledge and courageously to go by my own way [to a] bright future. Modern society needs good experts of law, which I hope to become. Amongst other opportunities, AUCA provides financial aid to all its students, through Kiva loans. I would also like to take the opportunity and apply for [a] Kiva loan. It will give me a great ability to cover my tuition

Lawrence Thembo hopes that in the future he will be able to expand more on the business. \r\n\r\nLawrence Thembo is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Lawrence Thembo who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1470897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more stock for the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukoki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.2 30.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-11-17T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-16T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lawrence Thembo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":211516},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":204143},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":261699},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227072},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":235273},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219156},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":243771},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":252576},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":271151},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":280945},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":291092},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":301606}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-15T00:06:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":632955,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Jane is single with six children.

Every day, Juana gets up and prepares the dough, which she cuts, molds and fills with delicious meat, chicken and vegetables. She makes her sales out of her home in cash, Monday through Sunday, from four until ten in the morning. Juana buys her ingredients in cash from wholesalers who give her competitive prices.\r\n\r\nJuana\u2019s primary customers are neighbors who live in her town. She says that she hopes to impress them day after day in order to increase her customer base, which will ultimately improve her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nJuana is requesting her first loan with Kiva and the field partner to buy a heated display case to keep her food at the right temperature. She will also use it to buy ingredients such as flour, salt, sugar, fats and meat in order to increase her production, which will make this investment a success.     \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":18.28,"image":{"id":1470326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a heated display case and ingredients such as flour, salt, sugar, oil, fats and meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-11-18T02:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-17T02:00:15Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33231},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":36228},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37315},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":38434},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":39587},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40775},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41998},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43258},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44556},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45892},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47269},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":51457}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.79},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.28,"local_amount":33231,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":35288.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732244,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T12:14:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":633085,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Please meet 21-year-old Rebecca from Liberia.

Kulbarchin has a high school education, and provides the primary source of income for her family by raising animals. She started 8 years ago with a 20,000 som (KGS) purchase of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work, she now owns a dairy cow. She earns a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business Kulbarchin came to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 110,000 som (KGS) loan to buy cows to increase her herd. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further expanding the number of animals she has, and saving for construction of a new house.

She started 34 years ago with a 1,000 som (KGS) purchase of animals. Thanks to her tireless work Sagipakan now has two dairy cows, a horse, and ten sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business Sagipakan came to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 50,000 som (KGS) loan to buy two heifers to increase her head of livestock. She plans to invest the earnings from use of the loan into further expanding her herd, and she also plans to save for construction of an additional shelter for the animals.

This is his method of sustaining his household and he can earn enough income for their daily expenses. His home is very simple and it urgently needs a roof replacement because the current roof is deteriorating and when it rains water leaks through it. Moreover, he would like to cement his floor which is currently made of dirt. He is seeking this loan from FUSAI, for these aforementioned tasks, to invest it in the purchase of galvanized sheet metal, wood, cement, gravel and mud to complete the most pertinent tasks. He hopes that he can count on this support and begin the repairs to his home as soon as possible. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1470361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy galvanized sheet metal, wood, cement, gravel and mud to repair the roof and to cement the floor of his home.
