He is excited to work with Honey Care Africa because their hive technicians give very good service and teach people about beekeeping. He is also very interested in beekeeping because he has heard that bee pollination will have a very positive on his passion fruit crops. \r\n\r\nThis is Salim's first loan, and he plans to use the income generated by his hives to pay his children's school fees. In the future, he hopes to continue to educate his children.

Tseren, 43 years old, lives with her family in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (a portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. She has been working in the service sector since 2009, and she is considered a good, skilled worker by her managers. Her husband has been working as a security officer for almost four years. In his spare time, he also renders taxi service to local people in order to generate additional income for his family. \r\n\r\nTseren and her family came from the countryside to Darkhan City in 2006 and began building their own house. Now the house is almost completed and some interior walls and window insulation remain.\r\n\r\nTseren is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 MNT to purchase fiberglass, foam, cotton, and straw. Using these materials, she and her husband can add insulation to their house. An insulated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and thus contribute to efforts against air pollution. Tseren is a very hard-working individual who strives for a better future as evidenced by her migration into an urban area.

","en":"Nazira is a 43 year-old woman.  She is married and has three children.  Nazira is involved in animal husbandry and farming.  She primarily grown potatoes at a dekhan farm.  Her primary income, however, comes from animal husbandry.  Nazira's son helps her with the animal husbandry business.  Additional income comes from her husband, who works in Russia and sends as much money as possible to the family every month.

She lives with her husband, six sons, and two daughters. Her husband is diabetic, so she always worries about his health. <p>\r\n\r\nFor five years, her husband has been running a wood shop, which is the only source of income for their family. All of her sons are very hardworking and help their father with his business. <p>\r\n\r\nParveen is a member of two-person group. She has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband with his business. Specifically, she is seeking a loan so that her husband can purchase a wood-cutting machine and some wood-related materials such as wooden sheets, nails, glue, and chemicals for his shop. As they have no other source of income, with the help of this loan, her husband should be able to continue to operate his business, and with the profits he expects to generate, he would like to open a new shop for his son. <p>\r\n\r\nParveen dreams of providing her children with bright futures and prays for her husband's good health. She says that BRAC provides benefits in the field of micro-finance, and she is very thankful to BRAC and Kiva for helping

In her free time, she enjoys having fun with her family doing activities such as cooking a regional dish of the region such as \u201cIndio Viejo\u201d, a soup with vegetables and corn. Unfortunately, because of a lack of money she could not go to university, but she would have liked to study social work.\r\nThanks to her spirit and desire to succeed she has a grocery store located in her home.

She has three dependent children, two of whom are still in school. The main source of her family\u2019s income is from corn and rice cultivation. To supplement the income, her husband works for others for a fee. Having been in the farming business for 10 years, she is able to earn daily income of KHR 27,600 to support her family, and she can save about KHR 10,000 per day for future needs.\r\n\r\nVutna\u2019s Group consists of two members who live in the same village.

He manages a cacao farm of two and half acres and about 1000 productive trees. Marcus notes that he does face certain challenges like pests \u2013 local leafcutter ants, birds, agouti \u2013 and diseases like black pod and monilia. Despite the difficulties Marcus is enthusiastic about slowly growing his cacao production. \n\nAs the sole bread winner of his home, Marcus works part time jobs, cultivating and selling other crops such has beans, corn, plantain and fresh vegetables, leaving little time for the management of his cacao farm. This Kiva loan will allow Marcus to hire the much-needed help to clean his farm and get it ready for transplanting new seedlings. Cacao farms in Belize are literally in the middle of the jungle, and require cleaning about three times a year. Cleaning is the process of removing underbrush to clear access to trees or prepare a plot for planting. \n\nMarcos\u2019 wife Luisa enjoys helping with harvesting and selling quality organic cacao to the buyers. The family puts a lot of importance on their children\u2019s education to ensure they have options when it comes time to stand on their own and provide for their own families. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":130.63,"image":{"id":1332972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean, prune and transplant Cacao","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Medina Bank","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-05-08T17:20:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-07T17:20:25Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":42.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993452,"comment":null},{"amount":41.77,"local_amount":83.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255621,"comment":null},{"amount":26.3,"local_amount":52.61,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":53.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136461,"comment":null},{"amount":20.86,"local_amount":41.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":42.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900677,"comment":null},{"amount":20.86,"local_amount":41.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":42.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088557,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-08T18:23:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":556543,"name":"3.9.281.08.thi\u1ec7u D\u01b0\u01a1ng Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. H\u1ea3i works in agriculture, farming poultry and\u00a0cattle.

He breeds cattle and he engages in producing and selling cheese and milk. He lives in the Batallas, a community whose inhabitants engage in agriculture and animal husbandry. This is Juan\u2019s first loan with our institution, and he will use it to buy a dairy cow. He wants to take advantage of this loan opportunity because he has not enough money to buy the cow, and this purchase will be of great benefit for him, as he will obtain more milk and will consequently succeed in producing more cheese and in having more milk to sell, thus improving his income. There are some challenges Juan has to face on a daily basis, such as buying fodder at a certain time of the year, and he will improve his cattle\u2019s condition thanks to the benefits from the loan.
