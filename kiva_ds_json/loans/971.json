Gangabali is one of them. The lady sitting third from right with raised hand is Gangabali. She is a very active and cheerful.

All her children are continuing their study.\r\n\r\nGangabali has been running a tailoring center with the help of her husband in her residence for 20 years.

The neighbors and the local community are the regular customers of her tailoring center. She earns a minimum of 200 INR every day, which is not sufficient for managing the day-to-day expenses of her six-member family.

is a graduate in economics. She is living with her long-time partner and three children.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1998, she applied for work as salesclerk at City Colorland. Luckily, she was hired as a salesclerk in the same year. \r\n\r\nNowadays, she manages her rice retailing, frozen foods and boarding house businesses. Aside from these businesses, Juliet also manages her transportation business as her additional source of income.\r\n\r\nJuliet's goal is to earn greater profits, let her children finish their studies, uplift their living condition and have a stable source of income. So, she patiently runs all her businesses to make all her dreams possible.

While waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, and paper. They sell these items to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, factories and other industries. Shirley also raises pigs in her compound and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nShirley hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and it's where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is married with six children, and five of them go to school. She has no additional family members. She sells secondhand clothes. She sells her products on a retail basis and from door to door. She has been in this business for the last 10 years. She works six days a week. She has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT \u2013 SACCO to buy a bale of secondhand clothes.

is from Chkhorotsku district. He is 28  years old and lives with his wife, infant daughter and parents. The family is involved in agricultural business. In particular, Bakur runs a small dairy farm--he has two calves and a milk cow, whose milk is used for cheese products, which are sold at the local open market. In addition, he has a pig and sells piglets locally. Besides, the family grows maize and nuts on family-owned land. Bakur also works as an artisan to earn additional monthly income. He is very hard-working young man, with a great desire to get ahead.\r\n\r\nHe requested a loan to expand the shed for cows. Bakur will purchase construction materials for a new cattle-shed.

She has been in this business for 20 years and sells to all kinds of people on both retail and wholesale, at the market and at home. She generates additional income by selling fried food. She works six days a week. Her major business challenges are thieves, transportation, and seasonality. She aspires to own a delivery van and to sell on wholesale only.

She was born in a village and has substantial experience in animal husbandry and growing crops. After she completed her schooling, Rakiba began working in the fields to earn money so she could help her parents. After getting married, she began working in farming again. Rakiba mainly grows wheat, barley and other crops. For the last 4 months, she has been doing this type of business independently, with the help of her husband. They sell their harvest directly to local residents at a price that is lower than what is charged at the market.

Sadid con la ayuda de su hermana, compr\u00f3 3 hect\u00e1reas de tierras y las dedic\u00f3 al cultivo de limones, mangos, guayabas y ciruelas principalmente, adem\u00e1s de la venta del carb\u00f3n; actividad que emprendi\u00f3 una vez lleg\u00f3 al municipio de Malambo, donde hoy habita y tiene su negocio, al que ha agregado otras tareas productivas. Sus principales clientes son las tiendas, a quienes les vende de contado y a diario, trabajando desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 4 de la tarde. Su meta m\u00e1s adelante es mejorar su medio de transporte o carretillas, que utiliza para llevar tienda a tienda de los municipios de Malambo y de Soledad, todos los productos que vende y con ello aumentar sus utilidades, todo esto, con el fin de mas adelante pueda incrementar su producci\u00f3n de tal forma, que logre mejorar las condiciones habitacionales, para siempre proteger sus hijos en especial al mayor de ellos,  que se encuentra en estado de discapacidad.

","en":"Sadid lives in Malambo with her spouse and two children who are 8 and 29 years old.  She has several businesses there.  On the one hand she sells charcoal while she also rents out tables.  She also provides transportation services with a cart and sells fresh fruit and vegetables.  She\u2019s managed to provide household income through these businesses since 1997 when she started them.  She knew this activity because she\u2019d learned it from her grandparents in a town in C\u00f3rdoba called Planeta Rica.\r\n\r\nWith help from her sister, Sadid bought three hectares of land and started to grow lemons, mangoes, guavas and plums mainly and also started to sell charcoal, an activity she started once she moved to Malambo where she now lives and has her business to which she\u2019s added other productive activities.  Her main customers are stores she sells to daily and for cash.  She works from 8am until 4pm.  Her goal for later on is to improve her means of transport or carts she uses to go from store to store in Malambo and Soledad taking all the products she sells so that she can increase profits.  All of this is in order to increase production later on so that she can do some home improvements to protect her children always, especially her oldest son who is disabled.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s currently

She sells merchandise through specialized product guides or catalogs, responding to orders that her clientele place as a result of her pre-sales work. \r\n\r\nThe main products that she works with are perfumes, cosmetics, creams, and  women's accessories. Currently her clientele is increasing, and the demand for these products is moving in the same direction. But her working capital is proving to be insufficient to respond to her potential clientele.

She sells fast food there and generates additional income renting out washing machines daily to her neighbors.  She started the business three years ago and when her husband became unemployed they decided to start the washing machine rental business, an experience she took from her mother-in-law who worked at that.  Ana also works as a domestic employee and the businesses are usually looked after by her spouse.  Taking advantage of her fast-food cooking skills she started this activity and with all of her activities together the couple supports their family.\r\n\r\nThe main things she offers are cold-cut plates, hot-dogs and hamburgers that are well-prepared with sauces and combinations thought up daily to delight her customers.  In the washing machine business her customers take the machines to their homes to do the washing for all the family members.  Currently, her businesses are in a growth phase and her working capital is insufficient to keep up with market needs which is precisely why she needs to apply for a Kiva loan to buy three washing machines to increase capacity and respond to service calls.  She will also buy sauces, cold-cuts, vegetables and bread rolls to increase offer of products in her food stand.\r\n\r\nThe success of her Kiva loans rests on her business experience meeting growing demand, especially during the second semester of the year which is a season when sales usually increase.  Her dream for prosperity is that the business grows to buy a house of her own and generate greater family wellbeing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1217956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

Her clientele has been gradually growing and she four years\u2019 experience tells her that she must apply for a loan in order to expand the volume of her sales. \r\n\r\nThis is why she\u2019s called on Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo where she\u2019s had one previous loan that helped her increase her buying capacity and her number of customers.  This is the reason behind her applying for a Kiva loan, her second loan from this organization, that she\u2019ll use to buy costume jewelry, steel and silver accessories, that sell very well during the year\u2019s second semester which is when the end-of-year parties approach and people want to look very elegant.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to become a wholesaler of these products and to supply many variety stores that she\u2019s already making initial contacts with.  Her experience and her capacity to make her dreams reality are the most important strength her business can rely on to make her Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1217963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy steel and silver costume jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75066},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73707},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75427},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":77187},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78988},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80831},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82717},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84647},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86622},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84808}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.61},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.22,"local_amount":75066,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":75981.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994432,"comment":null},{"amount":41.46,"local_amount":73707,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":74606.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130776,"comment":null},{"amount":42.43,"local_amount":75427,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":76347.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519634,"comment":null},{"amount":43.42,"local_amount":77187,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":78128.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071476,"comment":null},{"amount":44.43,"local_amount":78988,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79951.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497690,"comment":null},{"amount":45.47,"local_amount":80831,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":81817.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527506,"comment":null},{"amount":46.53,"local_amount":82717,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":83726.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928269,"comment":null},{"amount":47.61,"local_amount":84647,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":85679.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705424,"comment":null},{"amount":48.73,"local_amount":86622,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":87678.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967724,"comment":null},{"amount":47.7,"local_amount":84808,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":85842.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816931,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T00:13:26Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":485199,"name":"Maria Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Maria Luisa naci\u00f3 en la ciudad del Cusco y vive en la misma ciudad donde naci\u00f3, ella tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad y es soltera.

This is why he has turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase building materials. Mansurdjon thanks you for your support in advance.

Durga Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Indu, an active married lady of 32, is a resident of Bolangir town of Bolangir district of Odisha, India. The lady standing in the middle of the front row with raised hand is Indu. Her father-in-law migrated to Bolangir 25 years ago in search of work and since then her family is residing in a slum area of the town. In her family she has her husband, one son aged 14, and three daughters aged 10, 5 and 2 years. She hails from a below-poverty-line category. \r\n\r\nTo increase the income of her family, in the year 2010 she involved herself along with other four women of the same category of her locality and formed a joint liability group named Maa Durga to access loans from Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\nFor 15 years Indu, with the help of her husband, has been running two mobile businesses units with push carts. The first one is  selling  a mixture of puffed rice and boiled gram locally known as \u201c'mudhi' mixture\u201d  and second one  is mobile vending of low cost fancy items like balls, cups, plates, glasses, plastic containers, toys etc. in different localities, moving here and there. Her husband runs the 1st business from 1.00 pm to 5.00 pm in front of a school area and from 6.00 pm to 9.30 pm in the market area. \r\n\r\nThe timing of the 2nd business is from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon. The role of Indu in running the businesses is to prepare puffed rice, boil gram, pack related items and make the push cart ready to go for selling. For this she has to work for 15-18 hours daily.

For the past 3 years, Shamim has been working hard to manage her small business, where she sells soft drinks and juices. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shamim has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more soda, water and other drinks to sell, and will help Shamim to generate greater profits and use the profits to pay school fees for her children. Shamim hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nShamim is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

When she was a little girl her parents instilled in her a love of the earth and taught her how to work with it. Now, Anita is part of the group called Los Girasoles (in English: Sunflowers), which happen to be one of Anita's favorite flowers. As a young girl, Anita's parents taught her how to work on the land. Later, since she had not found any other steady job, she decided to dedicate herself to farming. \r\n\r\nFor the last 11 years, Anita has worked growing strawberries because she owns a wide plot of land that she doesn't want to waste. She also works selling milk. Anita has eight milking cows that she wakes up early each day to milk. She sells their milk to various families in her community and in a nearby town. \r\n\r\nAnita says that, \"Thanks to the loans that I have received from VisionFund, my business has improved, my cows are in better condition, and I have been able to grow more strawberries. Before, my earnings were not enough to sow more and to buy the fertilizers needed to grow them.\" Now, Anita is requesting a loan in order to improve her strawberry crop and to buy fertilizers to help them grow. She will also buy food, vitamins, and de-wormers for her milk cows in order to produce more milk. Currently, she gets about 250 liters each day because she cannot milk all of the cows at once. She must let them rest so they will produce more milk. \r\n\r\nAnita's goal is to increase the number of customers she serves. She would like to have a permanent spot in the market in her community where she could also make and sell cheeses, creams, sweet buns, and other dairy products. \r\n\r\nThe other 15 members of Los Girasoles are Graciela, Sof\u00eda, Gabriela, Paulina, Ysabel, Felipa, Sof\u00eda Salguero, Ver\u00f3nica, Teresa, Itxe Ivette, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Juana, Ma. Remedios, Raquel y Mariana. They will use their portions of the loan to stock a grocery store; to buy clothing and shoes to sell; to buy regional sweets, seasonal fruits and vegetables; to buy materials to make work gloves; for vehicle alterations; to obtain second-hand clothing; to buy perfumes and cosmetics to sell; and to buy chicken to sell by the pound."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6950,"image":{"id":1217371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food

He and his wife, Isabel, have given their all to provide their children with the values and principles to move up in life. One of those achievements is reflected by having completed the construction of their home. Skilled in the automotive field, Clemente has made a living as a mechanic for the past 15 years. He started out as an employee, which helped him gain valuable experience and confidence. He currently has his own shop, which his wife helps administer. Since he started, he has been very persistent with his work and never let up until the job was done. This allowed him to make friends, who became future customers he has worked with ever since, and made his business the biggest tool he has to make progress. One of his priorities is to acquire more spare parts in order to carry out his work more fluidly, since his clientele is increasing. In this way he will keep working so his business will be able to keep growing, and he will run it with the same enthusiasm in the future. This is his 16th loan, and as always he is grateful for the confidence Kiva partner MFP has put in him since he started investing in his business. He also says that he likes working with his fellow members of his community bank because he can see the progress. He plans to use the loan to purchase parts so he can keep his shop well supplied."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1218208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase auto parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-18T03:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-17T03:50:11Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clemente ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":221.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":218.8},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":240.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":248.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":257.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":258.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":274.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":280.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1002.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053673,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1002.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974351,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T18:08:59Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":483664,"name":"Ana Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana Marie is a married woman from Baclayon, Bohol.

He decided to form a communal bank called \"La Flor del Cafe.\"  This group has 4 members who are identified in the photo as follows:  at the left is Jose, beside him in the red shirt is Angel, next is Josue, and at the far right is Isrrael.  They all live in the same community and are all farmers.  This group loan is for 21,000 Honduran lempiras.  They will use this loan to buy fertilizers and manure to maintain their land so that they can obtain better harvests.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1218187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

ofrece servicios de mejoramiento de la imagen personal, a trav\u00e9s de cortes de cabello, masajes, peinados, pedicure y manicure. Inicialmente cuando empez\u00f3 su actividad, lo hizo para apoyar los gastos de su hogar, pues hasta ese momento se encontraban a cargo de su esposo. Poco a poco su negocio ha crecido y hoy apoya mas el bienestar de su familia y adem\u00e1s de sus vecinos, tiene como clientes a referidos por estos, a quienes dirige todos sus esfuerzos de mejoramiento, para fidelizarlos, porque son la raz\u00f3n de ser de su negocio. Sandra trabaja desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 7 de la noche diariamente y sin descanso, y all\u00ed tambi\u00e9n asesora en imagen y vende productos cosm\u00e9ticos, accesorios femeninos, perfumer\u00eda entre otros asociados a su negocio.

El crecimiento de su negocio es evidente y cada vez mas siente que su capital de trabajo no es suficiente para responde a su expectativa de crecimiento y a su misma demanda. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 tintes,  alicer, plancha, pintura de u\u00f1as, cosm\u00e9ticos y accesorios encargados por sus clientes para continuar el camino al \u00e9xito y con su credikiva aprovechar\u00e1 para tenerlo organizado en su otro local donde sabe que se mover\u00e1 mucho comercialmente. ","en":"Sandra, 41, is the owner of a beauty salon located in her home that she opened 10 years ago, given her inclination from a very young age for cosmetics and beauty.  Later this translated into what today is a business where she offers services for improving the personal image through haircuts, massages, hairstyling, pedicure, and manicure.  When she first began her activity, she did it to help with the household expenses, but up to then they were her husband's responsibility.\r\n\r\nLittle by little her business has grown and today she supports the well-being of her family as well as of her neighbors.  Her customers are referred by them, for whom she devotes all her efforts to improve, so she can cultivate their loyalty because they are the reason for her business.  Sandra works from 8 in the morning until 7 at night every day without resting.  She also does image consulting and sells cosmetics, women's accessories, perfume, and other things associated with her business.\r\n\r\nShe feels very satisfied with and stimulated by her job because it's well located near a very busy boulevard in the southern part of the city where a lot of people go by who know her.  She's going to move to a place away from her house, though, so she'll have more quiet at home.  The growth of her business is clear, and more and more she feels that her working capital is not enough to respond to her expectations for growth and to her own demand.\r\n\r\nThis is why she's getting a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She'll buy dyes, straightener, an iron, nail polish, cosmetics, and accessories ordered by her customers so she can continue on the road to success.  She'll make the most of her Kiva loan to have everything organized in her other place, where she knows she'll sell a lot.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1218157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

She runs her small grocery store that she has able to set up in an appealing space in her house 7 years ago. Her children help her in different activities. one of the things that motivated her to work as a shop owner was wanting to be at home with her children. On her list of customers are people who don't pay on time after she extends them credit out of friendship. This hurts her at times, but despite that she has had a certain success and so she has to stock up on a variety of products so that she can continue to be, as she has always been, the neighborhood favorite. She wants to expand her business and also start to build her house out of brick and she feels that it is possible. This is loan number 13. She is very grateful and confident she can make her payments.

He is single father raising two minor children: Emilia who is 1, and Carlos, who is 12. He works hard, thinking of his two big motivations. He owns a wooden house he acquired a short time ago.\r\n\r\nHe works as a cacao grower on the land he acquired 7 years ago thanks to a loan from his parents who have also been a big help with raising his children.  \r\n\r\nHe considers his work to be very interesting since he likes to lead and participate in the activities, whether they be maintenance or harvesting. Sometimes he has had to deal with some pests that disturb his land, damaging his production considerably. He considers his work to be very profitable because of the quantity of cacao he usually produces every season. This is part of what motivates him even more. \r\n\r\nAmong the things he plans on prioritizing the finalizing of the season and beginning the new one. To do this he has to acquire seedlings, organic fertilizer and tools to do his work with no problems.

She is 36 years old and mother of five children all of whom are students. Her husband is a small commission agent, who is without fixed employment. She sells drinks (Primus, Orange soda). She sets up her merchandise in her little kiosk. She started her business with her own money given to her by her husband. Later, she was the beneficiary of an additional sum from the IMF Hekima credit fund. She has been running these small businesses to assure her family's survival for over five years. However, she has now accomplished 18 loan cycles taking advantage of the IMF Hekima micro credit programme. Insecurity due to incivilities in town constitutes a threat to the development of her business. Thus, for this reason this loan has been diminished. This new loan will enable her to stock up with drinks (4 crates of Primus, 3 crates of orange soda, etc.). In addition, she hopes to see her children grow up and to create a bistro.

Meanwhile, to water his cows, he pastures them at the nearest river about 1 kilometer away. \r\n\r\nWhen he heard about water loans he was extremely excited and applied for a 2000 AZN loan. Building a water channel is quite an expensive process which requires labor and special equipment.  He will use this loan to pay for special equipment rentals, like a tractor, to build the water channel and for workers who will dig the land. This will be his second loan and he has good client history.
