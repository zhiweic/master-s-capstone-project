She says that seasonally when it is November, her husband goes off to make deliveries of this flower  throughout the country and this is the best time of the year for him because he has daily work. During the rest of the year he occupies himsef by working different routes with the minibus as public transport. Currently Yola, as her friends call her, is looking for a loan in order to purchase spare parts like tires and to perform maintenance on the minibus.\r\n\r\nShe says that the previous loans that she has taken out have helped her a lot because they have improved her family unit.

Varlam requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows and three calves. The cows are milked every day to produce cheese. The product is sold at the local market, and the family gets a small monthly income of 200 Lari. Their additional income is Varlam\u2019s son\u2019s salary. He is an artisan and works on house construction and renovations for private orders. \r\n\r\nVarlam requested a loan from Credo to start-up family business. Varlam has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Varlam will purchase a truck. He will be working on private orders as a driver to transport different types of cargo. Varlam will earn additional income for the family.

Two of his children are still in high school but the older two girls dropped out due to lack of school fees and now live with him and their children.  The family depends on their 3-acre piece of land for agriculture and dairy farming to get income for their basic needs.  Morrison, who is the head of the family, has to educate his two children in school as well as help take care of his 3 grandchildren from the little that comes out of his farming business. \n\nThrough hard work, he has bought 3 dairy cows with an earlier Mifugo loan advanced to him by Visionary Empowerment Programme and from these he is able to sell at least 20 liters of milk per day at about 25 US cents, making around $140 per month.  For the last 6 months he has also been using composting to grow vegetables for sale and makes an extra $23.\n\nHowever, a big percentage of this money goes into purchase of fuel which he can save by using renewable energy.  By having a biodigester constructed for him, he can save at least $16 spent every month on charcoal, $35 spent on kerosene, and the drudgery his wife and girls endure while searching for firewood.  With the bioslurry, he can also improve his agriculture by using higher quality manure, hence increasing his crop production and in the end increasing his income.  The increased income and the savings from fuel purchase will enable him repay the loan and have an improved lifestyle for himself and his family.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":293.77,"image":{"id":1377992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

This will make the lamps even more accessible to the clients who will no longer need to pay transport to come collect the lamps from our storage.  From the lamps she will make a profit margin of between $2-35 US and this will enable her repay the loan as well as plough some money back into the business for growth.\n\nBeing a very influential person in the community, she will be able to reach bigger numbers at the bottom of the pyramid as most people have confidence in her.  Demonstrations in the evenings when its dark will also help increase the confidence in the solar lamps which have passed the Lighting Africa standards test of quality.

He lives in the small village of Martvili District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and three grandchildren. Demur has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from their agricultural activities. In particular, they have three pigs, six milking cows and seven calves. They produce dairy products to sell. In addition, they have bee-hives with bee-colonies and a plot of land, where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested nuts and honey at local markets for a good price. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nDemur has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Demur has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan, Demur will open a grocery shop. He will purchase grocery stock and after opening a shop he will work hard to increase the income of his family.

Merab lives in the small village of Zeda Simoneti, which is in the Terjola district, with his 48-year-old wife Madona. Merab has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start a family business. However, he has not had any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has two milk cows and two pigs. The cows are milked every day to produce cheese and sell at the local market for a small income. From the pigs, they sell piglets. The family's total income is 280 GEL. This amount is rarely enough to buy food. \r\n\r\nMerab has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Merab has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business loans with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Merab will purchase chicks and chicken feed. He already has cages in which to place them. Merab is a very hardworking man. He wants to expand his agricultural business and increase the family's income. He will raise the chicks and sell them at a higher price. The increased income will give them an opportunity to have access to a better living. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":1375729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy chicks and chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Zeda Simoneti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-26T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-26T09:40:02Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merab ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":135.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":141.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":142.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":145.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":156.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":153.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":159.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":161.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":169.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":173.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":179.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":182.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":188.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":191.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":196.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":203.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":206.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":212.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":217.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.74},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.13,"local_amount":125.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":125.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613788,"comment":null},{"amount":76.08,"local_amount":125.49,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":125.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857500,"comment":null},{"amount":2272.79,"local_amount":3748.94,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3751.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134150,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-25T21:33:55Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:15:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574979,"name":"Trang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Trang was born in 1985.

On the land, potatoes, onions and different types of vegetables are grown. The cows are milked every day to produce dairy products. The harvested products and dairy are sold at the local market so the family can make a small monthly income. Their additional income is from Shota\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly salary and his grandmother\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n\r\nShota requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Shota has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Shota will purchase a minibus. He wants to start trading fruits and vegetables. With the mini-bus, Shota will be able to purchase products at a wholesale price and distribute them among the villagers and at the local markets with a price markup. Shota will work as hard as he can and earn a good profit. He wants to use part of the profit for reinvesting in his agricultural business in order to expand it.

She is 55 years old and started her business endeavors with her beauty salon where Relief International staff had the pleasure to meet her. Her salon is a small, reputable establishment attracting many clients in her neighborhood. \n\nWhile she is proud of her salon and the successes she had with the business, Bayan's passion is her art work. She makes beautiful crepe paper flowers which she displays in various ways on picture frames to hang as 3D art, in vases as simple bouquets or just as simple individual stem of flowers. The lifelike pieces take about 6-8 hours to make and she is constantly trying out new techniques and new type of flowers. Until now she has been working from her home in her spare time on this precious hobby, and then taking her works to various fairs in town where she can sell her products for about 60-80 dollars each. But unfortunately such fairs are infrequent, and also it takes time and money to attend them. And although she now has a lot of nice and finished pieces, she has no place to really display them and sell them. \n\nShe would like refurbish a little back storage space next to the salon, and use it as a small shop for the decorative pieces. The location is really ideal, as the room has a street front, and with some basic work can easily be turned into a cute shop for her works - an ideal start for a business opportunity she is so passionate about. \n\nJust Listen to her short video introduction: \n\"Hello, my name is Bayan. I learned this art and started working with the raw materials when I was a child and till now I enjoy working and improving my craft. And now I hope to make it even better and take it to the next level. I would like to teach the art and have a few people work with me, and together work on creating both clay ceramics and flowers - as you can see - which are made of crepe (or tissue) paper. And I hope to continuously improve my work and results. Thanks!\" \n\nBayan is taking an SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq to finance the refurbishment of the space and open the shop to display her works.

He believes he\u2019s doing well because he\u2019s very kind to customers and above all because he\u2019s responsible and professional with them.\r\n\r\nCarlos is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support they\u2019ve provided he will be able to buy wood to do his jobs and improve his income which will make it possible for him to continue striving to make his greatest dream reality: to have a great workshop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":579.82,"image":{"id":1377176,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-26T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-26T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":196.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":211.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":216.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":224.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":236.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":242.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":254.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":261.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":271.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":285.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":293.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":305.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":149.61,"local_amount":408.04,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":415.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776335,"comment":null},{"amount":79.26,"local_amount":216.16,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":220.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779342,"comment":null},{"amount":82.34,"local_amount":224.56,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":228.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054536,"comment":null},{"amount":86.55,"local_amount":236.05,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":240.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819439,"comment":null},{"amount":88.91,"local_amount":242.48,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":246.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472388,"comment":null},{"amount":93.15,"local_amount":254.04,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":258.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694871,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-06T20:02:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":575090,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience is 24 years old and lives in the West Point area which has the most populated market in Montserrado County.

He has quite a bit of experience in construction work because of the long time he\u2019s been doing it.  In addition to construction work he also works in agriculture to provide his home with needed food.  He buys his supplies for production in the nearest town located to the east of his house at a distance of about 1.5 kilometers.

This somewhat limits his ability to transporting his supplies to his house.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy 2000 roof tiles to repair his house.  He will use the rest to buy agricultural supplies: three sacks of manure and herbicide for the grass because this is the rainy season and it gets wet.

The family owns a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown. Harvested products are sold at the local markets and to the resellers. This is the only source of the income for the family, which is rarely enough for food for them. \r\n\r\nTengiz has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, without success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and  the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTengiz requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup with credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Tengiz will open a caf\u00e9 and he will purchase all the needed inventory and products.

lives in the Litein area of Kenya. She has four children and has been doing this work for 30 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Selling eggs'. Her biggest challenge is 'Raising poultry feeds.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Bahati.'\r\n\r\nAgnes was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Quick loan processing.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'That you must save at least 15 percent of the loan.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs.

is 24 years old.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nJano has a flat, which is rented out seasonally. His mother works as a cook in a local restaurant.  It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nJano requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Jano has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Jano will open an auto car wash. He will purchase a special apparatus, which is used for washing cars. After beginning the business he will be able to work hard and increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

","en":"Maria Luisa is 41 years old and is from the city of Estel\u00ed. She makes a living from the business of tortillas and sells them in her neighborhood. She started this business when her children were small; she couldn't leave them home alone so she made a few tortillas that she sold. With little money she was then able to accomplish what has helped her to get ahead.

Animals on the farm are not named.\r\n\r\nErick was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: \"quick loan processing\".  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro finance training session and he stated, \"That there are two grace periods\".\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Erick replied, \"I improve their livelihood\".\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

the owner of a dance studio that instructs over 200 students in over 130 different styles of dance, Laura is passionate about people from around the world, instilling in her students understanding and deep respect for each culture. Her motto is to \u201cbring the world together by teaching different international cultural dances, thereby bringing people together and honoring their unique and special lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaura\u2019s dance academy began from a life-long dream to teach the joy of life through dancing. Growing up in a family that owned a nationally recognized square dance apparel company, Laura\u2019s childhood was filled with dancing and colorful costumes. Her training began in a French ballet school, and she eventually graduated from the Georgia Copeland Studio. She spent the following years touring the world as a professional dancer, until she felt drawn back to her hometown of San Diego to open her first dance studio at 23.\r\n\r\nToday, Laura\u2019s studio, The Academy of World Dance N Arts, has evolved and expanded to its current location. She now employs two other dance instructors to provide her diverse range of classes. Laura prides herself in having the most affordable dance classes in the San Diego region to ensure that price is never a barrier for people who love to dance. She shares that her passion is to inspire people to follow their dreams, and that she loves to pass along the traditions and dances that may otherwise become lost.  \r\n\r\nThis loan from Kiva will enable Laura to purchase a sewing machine that can withstand the numerous costumes she hand-makes for her students. Her loan will also be used to purchase a new music system, gymnastics mats, and new copier and printer machines. \r\n\r\nLaura\u2019s dream is to open an additional studio space to open up the program to more teachers and instructors. With your help, Laura can continue to share the cultures of the world with her young dance students.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1305.93,"image":{"id":1376133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","use":"to

To support her family, she and her husband farm rice and plant sesame as the main sources of her family\u2019s income; they have been in this business for ten years.

With the support provided to the customer, he will purchase the fertilizer needed to cultivate 21,000 square meters of corn with the goal of increasing his production and generating a higher income when selling the produce he has obtained.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he will have the opportunity to cultivate a larger amount of grain and thus generate a greater surplus than he currently obtains in order to sell it and obtain a higher income at the end of the harvest. He plans to diversify the production that he currently manages in order to obtain new sources of income and to help his family to get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":637.25,"image":{"id":1378236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 6 quintals of fertilizer, 2 bags of corn seed and fungicide in order to control the pests and diseases that attack cornfields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.25,"local_amount":637.25,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":637.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716606,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-26T10:15:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":576995,"name":"Wossidji  V Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les  membres du groupe WOSSIDJI  V sont  des femmes mari\u00e9es avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 43 ans et ont en moyenne 5 enfants.

He is a man who was adopted as a child due to the extreme poverty of his birth family, which decided to give him to another family that would be able to give him what he needed because they had cattle and a respectable house. This is how he began his life with his new family. It was when he was eight years old that he started to be drawn toward farming and the care of animals, and this is how he has managed to achieve what he has today. \r\n\r\nHe buys his agricultural supplies in an area where he can get good prices, and to do so he travels 30 minutes by car.

With them, he hopes that milk production will reach seven to eight bottles a day. He knows this is how to invest the money because selling the milk will cover some of his family's other needs. He has always been dedicated to the care of animals, but they have always been other people's animals. With this loan he will buy his own cow and thus he hopes to continue growing. \r\n\r\nIn the future the client hopes to increase the number of his own animals, which he has dreamed of ever since he was little but has been unable to achieve so far because of his family's financial limitations. But there exists a second chance for everyone and Manuel hopes to be a milk producer at a grand scale with the help of Fundaci\u00f3n Campo.

","en":"Atunoy is a woman with a beautiful soul and a good heart. She is both the family manager and the main breadwinner for the family. She has a husband and three children. Since she was 13 years old, Atunoy has been in business. She sells fabric for sewing traditional women's dresses in the local market. She takes her business very seriously. Atunoy updates her goods seasonally and is expanding her product line. She is introducing her son to business and he helps her. She has lots of experience in business and has gradually developed her business.

a background in clinical psychology, Roslyn has always been passionate about helping others.  Roslyn first became interested in rebuilding families during her time as a Protective Services Assistant (PSA).  As a PSA, she would supervise visits between parents and children, often due to a court mandate or turmoil within the family.  Roslyn became adept at documenting the visits to share with the court.\n\nAfter some time as a PSA, Roslyn earned her credentials to work as a Child Protective Services (CPS) social worker.  After more than 15 years as a CPS social worker, Roslyn wanted to provide even more support to families going through difficult and often heartbreaking situations.  She earned her Doctorate in Clinical Psychology in 2011 and began providing therapy for individuals, couples and families. \n \nDetermined to provide even more specialized services, Roslyn decided to start her own supervised visiting facility, allowing parents in high conflict or high-risk situations access to their children in a safe and supervised environment.  Furthermore, Roslyn\u2019s facility, A Seed of Change, will operate as a community-based outreach program offering additional supportive services to families in crisis, i.e., conflict resolutions skills groups, non-violent communication skills groups, and parenting workshops.\n\nHer Kiva loan will be used to furnish her office with a computer, TV and homey furniture, creating an environment that is safe and nurturing for the clients she serves.  It will also be used to expand her office and secure licenses to connect with the court system.  \n\nWith your help, Roslyn can achieve her dream of rebuilding and caring for struggling families.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1022.11,"image":{"id":1376213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Medical

She is married to Leo, an employee. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMylene operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families, only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. She also has a direct selling business and a laundry shop. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 45,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nMylene hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life.

She is married to Reynaldo, a driver. Together with her husband, Susana manages the household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSusana operates a mobile store. Her mobile store is basically a small houseware store, which retails plastic containers, dipper, pails, plastic flowers and basins to the local neighborhood. She transports her goods around her local community to sell the products. She earns money by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 30, 000. She will use the loan to buy different products, such as dust pans, hangers, basins, pails, pitchers, glassware, laundry baskets, trays and other products needed for her store.\r\n\r\nSusana hopes that her business will grow and have another branch.

He is a hard-working, very humble person who never had the chance to know his father.  It was very difficult for Gregorio growing up without a father and, because he was the eldest son, he was the one who had to help his mother to farm and work for the family.  He started growing his first field of corn at the age of 15 and hasn't stopped working since.  Nobody taught him all the things he knows about farming.  He learned them because he could see the needs of his siblings and mother.\r\n\r\nIn common with other farmers in his area, Gregorio buys his supplies wherever he can get them at the best price and save a few pesos.  He has to travel around 30 minutes by pick-up truck from his community to get to the place where he buys his supplies and this has its price because he has to pay for them to deliver the products to his property, where he loads them onto his back and carries them to his humble home.\r\n\r\nGregorio is requesting this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy three sacks of fertilizer, corn seeds, and herbicides and fungicides to control pests and weeds that can damage his crops.

is Visitacion, age 46, resident of Caloocan 5, Philippines. She is married to Antonio, an employee. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nVisitacion operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. She also has a direct selling business and a laundry shop. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a loan of PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products.\r\n\r\nVisitacion hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1376444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken and vegetables, and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T10:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T10:40:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Visitacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6846.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381670287,"comment":null},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":6666,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6845.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534828,"comment":null},{"amount":126.66,"local_amount":5333.62,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5477.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784223,"comment":null},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":1333.38,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1369.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771210,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-27T13:58:21Z","paid_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":575436,"name":"Sylivia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sylivia is a 26-year-old married woman with one child living in Kasese, Uganda.\r\n\r\nShe has been in the salon business for seven years and works 10 hours a day located on a busy street.
