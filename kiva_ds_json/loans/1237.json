Abib says his major challenge is the unfavorable weather which affects his tea product, but he believes that, if given the loan and if he keeps being the honest person he has always been, he will do better and will achieve much from tea-farming."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":133.33,"image":{"id":1447743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-10-15T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-14T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abib","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":169680.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429636135,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":166666.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":169679.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863571,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T15:05:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":620147,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Juana  es una mujer adulta de 45 a\u00f1os de edad madre soltera de una hija la cual vive con ella con un grado de educaci\u00f3n primario incompleto que pudo cursar hasta el tercer grado pero da gracias a sus padres por el apoyo brindado.

In the short term, he hopes to increase his business and with this to be able to continue supporting his family so that they have better opportunities in life.\r\n\r\nCholuteca, Honduras \u2013 September  2013\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1452047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy iron, a blowtorch, clamps, a square, etc., for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noel Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429614502,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840925,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T16:57:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":617737,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 35 years old, married, and has four children.

With much effort, his parents were able to give him an education with a technical degree. Later he had to work on his own i agriculture and other daily activities that helped him bring in income for his family.

His two children are in primary school and another is in eighth grade. \r\n\r\nOscar has a little jewelry store with a relative in the city. With a lot of hard work and perseverance, he was able to open it. He learned this activity about 10 years ago. A friend who did this activity taught him and he had to pay to learn the profession. In addition, when he has little work he works as a bricklayer, since his father taught him that activity. Weekends he is a collector for a bus that goes through the communities close to where he lives. Every day he goes out very early to his little workshop in the city 4 kilometers from his house and he comes back in the afternoon. When he has a lot of work he takes it home and has to stay up all night so he can get out on time with the orders.  \r\n\r\nThe money from the loan will be used to t build walls on his wife's store. Right now, she just takes out some of the merchandise and leaves the rest inside the house because he space where she has the store is very small. \r\n\r\nHe hopes that in the future he can expand his little jewelry store, setting up another store somewhere else to help with the family income. He hopes to give his children an education, if possible, a college education.

He has worked in farming since he was 11 years old. He learned the trade from his uncle who raised him because his parents did not take care of him. He never went to school as he needed to work to survive. He currently sows 14,000m2 of corn, and he sells the cobs. The corn is produced using an irrigation system in order to obtain four harvests per year.  To carry out the irrigation, he has to install the pipes in every single furrow and to water a 7000m2 area takes two days. To buy his supplies, Antonio takes the local bus to the city, 30 minutes ride away. He is requesting $500 to buy six bags of fertilizer and other supplies to sow 10,500m2 of corn. With the money from the loan, he will only need to make one trip to buy the supplies, and this will save him time and money as they will charge him less for buying in bulk. Once he has all the supplies, Antonio will be able to take better care of his crops and obtain a more abundant harvest. His income will increase allowing him to pay back the loan and put food on the table for his family. Antonio dreams of having three dairy cows to have an extra source of income and food for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1452073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy six bags of fertilizer and other supplies to sow a 10,500m2 area of corn on irrigated land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T06:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T06:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716647,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-16T15:35:43Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":617780,"name":"Claudio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Claudio is 43 years old and married with three children.

I am very interested in European Studies, both on a national and international level, and am determined to promote positive change in my country and region. I am convinced that completion of my studies at the American University of Central Asia will provide me with the capacity to do so. \r\nAUCA provides the best quality education among Central Asian universities with two diplomas, both Kyrgyz state and Bard college diplomas. Another important point is that I have a high regard for AUCA's liberal arts program as every course is worthy of a bachelor degree. The academic environment at AUCA is welcoming and has responsive instructors who are highly experienced. Studying in the Preparatory Program already gave me the chance to prepare myself for further study at AUCA by improving my English speaking and grammar and most importantly writing skills with the support of my instructors in the Preparatory Program. \r\nAUCA also provides students with the facilities required for learning and I am sure higher education at this unique university will lead me toward success and a bright future. As a result, according to my academic achievements, personal qualities and social work, I will be able to be a promising student of the AUCA. My previous academic achievements and active participation at my school\u2019s extracurricular activities are examples of my interest in Europe.\r\nStudying at the Preparatory Program made me more enthusiastic to study at AUCA and I know that AUCA is the right place for me.  I chose to study at AUCA in order to have a successful future not only for me and my family but also for my community and country. I am certain that through pursuing my career I can move towards the achievements of my long standing goals of my country\u2019s political, social and economic improvement. And studying at the European Studies Department at AUCA will support me to reach my aims and ambitions. It will also provide the chance and prospect for the fulfillment of aspirations of a Kyrgyz girl who is looking ahead with immense sense of hope for a bright future to be part of the modernization and advancement of my beloved country.\r\nBut unfortunately my family is not able to afford the full tuition at AUCA.

I feel happy to work in this field, earn money for my daily life, and I\u2019m proud to have two daughters who have already made their certifications as well. And I plan to expand this beauty shop.\u201d  \n\nShe enjoys working with her customers and is happy for having been able to open and maintain a reputable salon. To ensure the salon continues to provide high level services, Shlair decided to take a SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq in the amount of $10,000. She would like to update the style of the salon, most importantly to buy new special chairs for both the hairdressing works and for the beautician\u2019s corner. As she explains, the current chairs are very old, hard to work with and one of them is completely out of order with a broken system. She will also use the loan to purchase additional high quality cosmetics and supplies, and based on her customers' requests, she would also like to buy certain items for retail in the shop and this way help her customers gain access to products unavailable in other shops.  \n\nAfter the upgrade of the salon is complete, Shlair\u2019s long term goal is to establish her salon as a teaching institute for other aspiring women interested to work in the field."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3336,"image":{"id":1431454,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2883,"youtubeId":"4UNA_b2yxQ4","title":"Kiva Borrower Shlair from Iraq","thumbnailImageId":1432083},"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to update the style of the salon, most importantly buy new special chairs and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":10000,"lender_count":307,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shlair","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":10000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":837},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":837},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":3336,"local_amount":3336,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T10:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3336,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429948241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T23:09:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608721,"name":"Shireen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Experiencing first hand a community level problem effecting many families, Shireen turned a personal need into an enterprise.  \n\nIn 2003, working as a teacher herself, Shireen had work commitments until 5pm but was unable to find day care for her young child. The few government provided facilities were inadequate, crowded and would only be open until 1pm \u2013 leaving many families in deadlock when choosing between mothers working or staying at home.\n\nWith very little money, no support, and many challenges Shireen took matters into her own hands and decided to open a private kindergarten and day care center. While many people would not believe in her potential for success and commented the opening with sour words, she had proved them wrong. The small endeavor had since outgrown its original location and since 2009 operates from 3 small locations \u2013 one of which is shown on the pictures.\n\nShireen now has 10 years experience with managing kindergartens, and 19 years experience as a teacher.

I established the Kindergarten because when I had my baby I didn't find a place to put her in during my work as a teacher until 5:00 pm. It was the first private Kindergarten in the area. Now there are 60 women working in my Kindergartens and 5 drivers, we created jobs for 60 women. Now we have 200 kids. The Kindergarten work starts beginning of September 2013.\u201d\n\nShireen works with a small profit margin to ensure her kindergarten\u2019s services are affordable for working families. Continuing to provide services with a high level of attention to details Shireen is taking an SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq in the amount of $25,000 which she will use to install a fire alarm system, fix water pipes, and renew some of the furnishing and carpeting as required by local regulations.\n\nShireen would one day like to also open an orphanage to provide care and education for children most in need."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":25000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4180,"image":{"id":1431416,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2882,"youtubeId":"JAAPaeMQl28","title":"Kiva Borrower Shireen from Iraq","thumbnailImageId":1431411},"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","use":"to install a fire alarm system in the kindergarten","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":25000,"lender_count":882,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shireen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":25000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1057},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1041}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1057},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2098,"local_amount":2098,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2098,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419961988,"comment":null},{"amount":1041,"local_amount":1041,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T10:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1041,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429948242,"comment":null},{"amount":1041,"local_amount":1041,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1041,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439841678,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T21:15:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":617785,"name":"Jessica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jessica, who is married with an only child, resides in Mansabay Bajo, Lopez Jaena.

is a student of the American University of Central Asia, department of Journalism and Mass Communication and here is her story.\r\n\u201cThe American University of Central Asia is the university of my dreams. I planned to enter this university two years ago and since then I have been studying to the best of my abilities to make my dream come true. I have always tried to find out as much information about AUCA as possible. For this I have been surfing the internet, communicating with current students and my aunt, who also graduated from AUCA. I am really happy that I am a student of AUCA now and that I could make it happen. \r\nFive years ago I could not even imagine that I would enter the Journalism department. I had a great desire to become a doctor. However, I understood with years that I don\u2019t want to devote my life to medicine. I am such a sociable person. I always try to be in touch with the situation. So, I think that a profession of a journalist suits me most and I have several reasons for this. \r\nFirst, a profession of journalist is by far the most interesting one for me. It is always great to learn all the news and to find out some facts that are not open to general public. Secondly, I want to learn how to use words correctly. Unfortunately, nowadays there is too much false information on the Internet. May aim is to tell people true facts about our world. Thirdly, I want to make changes in my lovely country. \r\nUnfortunately my parents can\u2019t afford full tuition at AUCA. My family is pretty big, which consists of 6 people. So I need a KIVA loan, because it will help me to think about education, to study well and not to think about finance.\u201d

He could not continue studying because of the war. He is in a relationship and has five children. Four of them do not live with him; they have their own families. He lives with his two-year-old child and his partner, who works with him in agriculture.\r\n\r\nLuis has worked in agriculture since he was eight, taught by his father. He says that his father told him that it was better to learn how to work in order to maintain his family once he got married. Today, he thanks his father because he can make a living, but he thinks that if he had studied, he would have more opportunities. He also owns four cows. His day starts at 4 am. While he milks the cows, his wife prepares coffee and breakfast.

","en":"This client is 45 years old and is named Marisol. She lives in the city of Latacunga in a town called El Calvario, which is almost in the centre of the city. This town is much loved and appreciated by its inhabitants, since it is here that the Latacunga community's most loved image of the virgin, La Virgen De la Merced, is found.\r\n\r\nMarisol lives here with her two sons, Sebasti\u00e1n and Juli\u00e1n, who are already young adults. She had to bring them up alone as the father of her children never took responsibility for them. Marisol has had to go without and suffer humiliation, but fighting for her children has never been an obstacle and now they keep her company and look after her. As she had to do without many necessities, Marisol was forced to find a way to survive and that is the reason why she was able to find the best way of getting ahead by selling quilts, pyjamas, sheets, etc. She does not have a fixed timetable and this helps her to spend more time together with her children. After all, Ms Marisol Garc\u00eda is not only the mother of her children but also their friend. In addition, she gets extra income selling beauty products from a catalogue.\r\n\r\nMarisol is applying for a loan that will allow her to have a greater variety of stock and merchandise to offer her customers. With the additional profit that she makes she will be able to finish the course of medical treatment she has been undergoing for a while now, as due to a lack of money she has been unable to finish it. For this reason Marisol and her two children would like to thank those who form part of this noble institution very much as well as those who have opened their doors so that she can meet her needs. She gives thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Equador and to Kiva for making the development of her personal and family life possible."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":165.68,"image":{"id":1452080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase merchandise and vary her stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T11:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T11:10:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":913.22,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.18},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.98},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.13,"local_amount":78.12,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":79.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059942,"comment":null},{"amount":86.55,"local_amount":85.45,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":86.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995275,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-06T00:10:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":617810,"name":"Tina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tina is a 53-year-old married woman with ten children.

The beneficiaries of the lanterns have finished repaying their loans and now are happy they no longer have to spend money on kerosene. They recount that these lanterns are ideal for children to read and write by; they are portable for farmers to use to go about their daily chores after sunset; they are able to charge their mobile phones and brighten up their dwellings. \r\n\r\nThe organization group membership has increased from 400 groups to 520 groups in the last one year. Among the products offered by REEP, solar lanterns have been the most successful product because of their huge economic and social value: cutting down the recurring paraffin costs and carbon emissions. \r\n\r\nMr. Knox is determined to replace all the smoky unsafe candles and kerosene lamps among the members with the solar lanterns which offer bright and safe light and come with a mobile phone charging function. There is still a huge portion of the group without solar lanterns, so the demand is still very high for him to meet from his limited cash flow. Knox is therefore requesting a new loan to buy more lanterns for selling to the members. On the uploaded photo is Knox with Loice, a member of one of the new groups to join REEP.
