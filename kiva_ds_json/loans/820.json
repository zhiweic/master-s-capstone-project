She is married to Alba Jhasmany and the couple have a 10-year-old daughter together.  Their daughter is in elementary school.  Amanda lives in the community of La Maica, south of Cochabamba.  She lives in her parents' home because her house is still being built.  Her parents gave her a plot of land as an inheritance and that is where she is building her home.  Right now the three of them live in just one room where they are all very uncomfortable.  Amanda's main business activity is selling food such as 'chicharr\u00f3n de cerdo' (seasoned pork ribs cooked in fat and beer) which is a traditional regional dish, as well as duck, rabbit, etc.  She carries out her work every weekend, from Friday to Monday.  Her husband works every day as a taxi driver.  In this way, the two of them work toward finishing the building of their house.\r\n\r\nAmanda's previous loan helped her a lot because she was able to use it to buy 10 pigs at a very low price when that opportunity presented itself.  This enabled her to increase her income.  She feels very happy because, with the profits, she managed to make quite a bit of progress in building her house.  This new loan will also be used to buy at least 20 pigs.  This will allow her to have enough in stock so that she can continue making her 'chicharr\u00f3n de cerdo' as this is the business activity that makes her the most profits. Cooking is what Amanda does best and so her future goals and dreams include owning a large restaurant where she can prepare her delicious

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNorania operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sells them for a little profit. Her products are pants, clothes and other similar products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy RTW products and merchandise to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNorania hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years.

Lamara sells the agricultural products, such as beef, lamb, milk, honey, eggs, wool, vegetables and fruits, obtained from her farm, to stores in the city of Kapan and, thus, supports her family. \r\nLamara is 49 years old and lives in the Shishkert village of the Syunik region.  She graduated from a nutrition college, but was unable to get a job because she got married and had three children.

She sees Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer's loans as an opportunity to make progress and considers them to be a great help for the micro-businesswomen in her group.\n\nThis is the second loan that Ana has requested and she will invest it in buying pigs, concentrated feed, vitamins and antiparasitics.\n\nAs a good leader, Ana has well-defined goals, one of which is to grow her business so that she has a large production of pigs.  Another of her main goals is for all the members of her group to help each other, work as a team and be supportive of each other through their Women's Bank.\n\nIt is important to note that this group initially had 9 clients, which is why there are three extra women in the photo.

is Evangeline, 49, who is a resident of Taguig city, Philippines. She is married to John Carlo, her business partner, and she is a mother to her four children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEvangeline operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEvangeline dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

35, is a resident of Taguig City, Philippines and the mother of two children. Her husband, Joery, is a driver. Nenita and her husband manage their household while operating a business. Nenita works hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNenita operates a variety store which, in the Philippines, is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Nenita earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Nenita earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Nenita is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNenita hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1054072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-28T01:16:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-27T01:16:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nenita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":7548.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606700,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5032.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095557,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6290.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359167,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5032.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303002,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6290.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-06T17:40:03Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407952,"name":"Leocio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leocio, 36 years old, lives in Happy Valley, Tambulig, Zamboanga del sur.

For a number of years, Ludis has been cultivating cassava.  He's been affected the most by heavy downpours that destroyed his crops, literally leaving nothing left of his cultivations.  But thanks to the support that Afodenic has provided him, through Kiva, he managed to put in a quarter of a manzana  (about half an acre) of squash.  In this way he managed to pay off his loan and continue working as a farmer, because he supports his family with the sale of his crops.  Now he needs to buy cassava stalks so that he can go back to growing this crop.  He will also buy fertilizers and other supplies that he needs to control any pests that appear.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJosephine operates a food stall. She sells snacks like fruits, juices, and other street food staples. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of raw products and supplies she uses in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJosephine dreams of giving her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1054252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-28T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-27T15:00:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":11250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":11315.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606708,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6286.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095565,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5028.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359175,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5028.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303007,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2514.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355784,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-10T04:29:28Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408063,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is from Iraq.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.

He is a living example that despite the pains and problems than may come our way, you keep going. Five years ago he became a widower. His wife had an illness from which she could not recover. He then became father and mother to his daughter, who is now 26 years old. He struggles every day to provide a better future for her and so that she will be proud of him. He also wants to show her that with sacrifice everyone can improve his life. He lives and works in the city of Pisco in San Andr\u00e9s district, where the beaches are beautiful. One of the district's principle activities is fishing, which is Pedro's occupation.\r\n\r\nPedro works from morning to night as a fisherman and specializes in catching shellfish. He gets up at dawn to go out in his boat. He learned to fish at a very early age from his father, which encouraged him to become a fisherman. He believes that his business is going well because God is always with him. He also has an angel, his wife, at his side watching him; so he goes out each day with a great deal of faith. \r\n\r\nPedro is very grateful to the Kiva lenders whose support will let him do maintenance on his on-board air compressor and motor.

While he sells natural juices, she,  has a sewing business and sells cell phone minutes in the southeastern sector of the city where they live,.\r\n\r\nNoris arrived in the city of Baranquilla some 30 years ago, directly from Cesar Department, from which she had to migrate due to the lack of public order at that time. In her shop, Noris makes, especially, sheets and bedcovers, and starting 2 years ago, added a new activity to generate additional income -- selling cell phone minutes. She also has a motorcycle to rent and that too produces income.\r\n\r\nNoris persistently works hard because she dreams of having her own house in the future and of expanding her business. At present, she is applying for a \u201ccredikiva\u201d (a Kiva loan), her 1st financing through the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, to buy cloth for making sheets and bedspreads in larger quantity. This will enable her to earn more income by providing her clientele with what they want. After all, Mother's Day is coming, when Noris's merchandise is appropriate and sells well, assuring the success of this investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1053438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"buy cloth to make sheets and  bedspreads in larger quantities to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-28T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-27T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":44143},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52251},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53470},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54717},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55994},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":57301},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":58638},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":60006},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61406},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62839},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64305},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74930}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.74},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.22,"local_amount":44143,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":44269.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141167,"comment":null},{"amount":60.41,"local_amount":105721,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":106023.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101047,"comment":null},{"amount":31.27,"local_amount":54717,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":54873.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395232,"comment":null},{"amount":32,"local_amount":55994,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":56153.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775038,"comment":null},{"amount":32.74,"local_amount":57301,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":57464.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387031,"comment":null},{"amount":33.51,"local_amount":58638,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":58805.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993889,"comment":null},{"amount":34.29,"local_amount":60006,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":60177.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130252,"comment":null},{"amount":35.09,"local_amount":61406,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":61581.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519142,"comment":null},{"amount":35.91,"local_amount":62839,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":63018.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347070988,"comment":null},{"amount":79.56,"local_amount":139235,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":139632.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497227,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-20T06:55:00Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:34:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407799,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal\u201d CHOQUEQUIRAO\u201d;

Gia and Ekaterine will work hard during spring and summer.  They hope that the weather is favorable and the family will get a good harvest, which will be sold for a good price.

","en":"50-year-old Isabel is a vendor of new clothing and she is very happy that she has her own stall located in one of the markets in the capital. \r\n\r\nFor Isabel, making improvements to her home has not been easy - she has had to make many sacrifices as the prices of building materials are constantly rising in her country. \r\n\r\nIsabel expresses her appreciation of microfinance, as without this support she would not have been able to construct her house. She will invest this loan in building the inner walls of her home and will continue to improve the roof, which requires the following construction materials: Cement, blocks, iron, gravel, zinc sheets, bolts and beams, among others. The construction will allow her to build up her entire home in concrete and get rid of the cracks in the boards that have been deteriorating over

is comprised of 11 hard-working women who want to improve their small businesses and their childrens' quality of life.  All of them strive to give their children a better life for the future of the country.\r\n\r\nAll are from the city of Pinotepa where \"las chilenas\" dancing is popular and where most of the inhabitants are indigenous and need the foundation's help to improve their lives.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Mrs. Cecilia, 42, who is a hard-working, humble woman who wants to expand her business.  Do\u00f1a Ceci, as she is known by her colleagues in the group, has been selling vegetables for three years.  She also teaches at the community school and claims that from a very young age she was always interested in teaching and helping children with slow learning skills.\r\n\r\nShe tells us about one of her business experiences.  When she started teaching she decided to sell vegetables as a way to increase her income, but did not know how to get started.  Later she learned about the foundation's loan program and started her business thanks to help from the foundation.  Her business is growing daily and she is earning enough to help her niece, Maria del Rosario, who she loves very much and works for, teaching and selling vegetables.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan to buy more vegetables such as: potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, squash, carrots, green tomatoes, coriander, lettuce and papaya.  She is grateful to the foundation for supporting working women who want to improve their family's lifestyles.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nBernarda Alejandrina - who sells Mexican snacks.\r\nPrimitiva Balbina - who sells cheese.\r\nAustreberta  Virginia - who sells dough and nixtamal.\r\nYolanda - who sells fried meats.\r\nAlba  Leonila - who sells clothing.\r\nGloria Rosalba - who sells softdrinks.\r\nGloria Josefa -

She has five children, three daughters and two sons, who are already married and have children of their own.\r\n\r\nRosa Elia lives with her mom.  Her business is selling bread and soft drinks.  She has been in this business for 20 years.  She tells us that she used to sell only bread and she only sold it retail.  However, over time and with the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, she bought more bread so that she could sell both wholesale and retail.  She tells us that she goes out into the streets of her community to sell her bread in the mornings and afternoons while her mom and grandchildren stay at home selling bread.  She tells us that she is very happy because, with the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, she will be able to buy more bread to sell.  She will also buy soft drinks in different flavors so that her neighbors buy drinks from her at meal time.\r\n\r\nRosa Elia thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for supporting her and making her dreams come true.

The group voted on this name because they say that every year Monarch butterflies come to Michoac\u00e1n and to their community.  They are really happy about this and they receive the butterflies with a lot of happiness because they know that they are a part of their environment and they like them a lot.  This is why they gave their group the name they did.  Their community has beautiful views because it is high up in the mountains and they have a very good view of large swathes of green trees which are very beautiful.

He also says that this business will help him to make progress in life and improve his personal financial situation as he believes it to be a promising project.  He adds that he has the support of his community in carrying out this business activity.\r\n\r\nPedro is currently requesting a micro loan for 1,050,000 colones so that he can buy vegetables to sell in neighboring communities.\r\n\r\nPedro is a member of the Ca\u00f1a Blancal community loan company, one of 110 organizations associated with EDESA in Costa Rica.
