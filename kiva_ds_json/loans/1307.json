He was not able to go further because there were many obstacles and he needed to help his father at work. He lives with his partner, who has the same level of education. She is a housewife, and together they have three children. The youngest is 8 and is in third form at the local school. The middle child, a girl, is 13 and is in eighth form. She has to attend school in the main town of the region, since there is no eighth form in the village where they live. The oldest is 15; he does not go to school anymore because he was bullied and instead decided to help his father at work in order to improve the family's income. Andr\u00e9s has been a fisherman since he was 10 years old and learned the trade from his father, who was able to support Andr\u00e9 and his brother thanks to the proceeds from his fishing, a tradition Andr\u00e9s now continues. Andr\u00e9s is also a farmer: he grows 3,500 square metres of sweetcorn, which enable him to feed his family. They live very close to the sea, since their house is practically on the beach. This is convenient because it means he does not have to travel very far to go to work. He goes to sea with his son either during the day or at night, depending on the tide. He will use the loan to buy a more powerful boat and engine from a friend. Andr\u00e9s already has some money of his own, which he saved towards this purchase. His goal is to expand his business, since he wants to bring in more fish. He would be able to lend the boat to someone else and, thanks to this small fleet, increase his income in order to give his family a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a boat and an engine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-20T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T11:30:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\u00c0ndres Abelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":35.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":37.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":42.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":58.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":64.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":71.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":73.65},{"due_date":"2016-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":95.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.48},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.65},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T15:19:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":658774,"name":"Santa Ana Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marta es una de las tres integrantes del grupo tiene la edad de 42 a\u00f1os, casada, con dos hijos, su negocio es la venta de reposter\u00eda en Managua desde hace 5 a\u00f1os.

She plans to use this loan to purchase more clothing to resell and she will take advantage of the year-end holidays when there is increased business and therefore more income. The income generated by her business supports her two children so that they can stay in school. Her daughter is in college and studies law and her son is in high school. Irma fully understands that education is a vital key to a successful future, an understanding shared among the almost 19,000 women in Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe women in the Trust Bank \u201cEl Roble\u201d group are engaged in commercial ventures and sell various items like clothing, perfumes and beauty items, cleaning products, and vegetables and fruit.

Five years ago, her husband gave her seed money to start a money-making business selling merchandise on credit to friends. The idea turned out to be successful because she shortly gained customers among her friends and relatives. Today her clientele has grown through referrals.  She sells jeans, shirts, pants, sweaters, perfumes, and women's accessories directly to customers on credit and for cash. She works from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. daily and buys from wholesalers. Her goal is to have a shop open to the public and win the loyalty of her customers so that she can increase sales and profit. She dreams of paying for her children's education so that they can have a bright future.\r\n\r\nBebsy needs to meet year-end demand so that she can sell more and increase her profit, but she doesn't have enough working capital to meet market demand. So she has applied to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for her first Kiva loan, which she will use to buy jeans, shirts, blouses, shoes, colognes, perfumes, and more. She will be able to service her customers and to feel satisfaction in accomplishing her goal.

I worked with him for about 15 years, during which time I learned the styles and techniques of the Ashanti and Akwamu people. My work began to flourish and achieve recognition.

Together with her husband, she fights every day for a better future for her family.  She was only able to study through her second year of primary school because she wanted to help her parents so that her siblings were never in need of anything; to do this, she had to abandon her studies.  When she was a young girl, there was also limited access to education.  \r\n\r\nNarcisa is married, and her husband earns a living making cheese in a small family business.  Her children have built her and her husband a home, and the two of them live there together.  \r\n\r\nShe makes a living selling basic grain crops, including corn, gama grass, beans, and other items.  She has been doing this for seven years, and she learned this trade from her husband.  She also takes care of the home chores and helps her husband to make cheese.  Narcisa runs her business out of her house, and she works every day.  When there is a lot of buying activity, she also sells in the town square.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy the recently-harvested grains that are currently most plentiful in the market; this will allow her to buy the grains at a very low cost, to store them, and to then sell them when the price rises, thereby increasing her net profit.  She currently does not have her own capital to invest.  She needs financing in order to take advantage of this business opportunity.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to fix up her house, since it is in poor condition right now.  She hopes to save some of the income she makes over time so that, once she has saved up enough, she can improve her home.

KTDA aims to bring a range of high-quality and affordable Barefoot Power solar lighting products to address a critical need for lighting and other basic energy uses among small-holder tea farmers in Kenya.\r\n\r\nKTDA Foundation will accomplish this by leveraging the existing KTDA infrastructure to ensure that the solar lamps reach the farmers and that periodic payments are collected and accumulated for repayment of the loan.\r\n\r\nCompany Background\r\n\r\nKenya Tea development Authority Foundation is a non- profit charity of the Kenya Tea Development Agency (Holdings) Limited. Its key objective is to raise funds to initiate and support programs that improve the welfare of 560,000 small-holder tea farmers in Kenya. KTDA Foundation is the vehicle through which KTDA, its subsidiary companies and factory companies carry out corporate social responsibility activities.\r\n\r\nThere are eleven (11) counties that dominate in tea growing in Kenya and where KTDA operates most of its tea factories. These are Murang\u2019a, Meru, Kisii, Nyeri, Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Kericho, Bomet,\r\nNandi, Nyamira and Embu. The common denominator in all the counties is low penetration of electricity. While the national penetration is estimated at 23%, these 11 counties have an average electricity penetration of only 16%. Kerosene is used by 80% of the households in these counties as the only source of lighting. \r\n\r\nKerosene is expensive in use: a typical off-grid household spends over Ksh.18,000 (USD 200) per year on kerosene for lighting and mobile phone charging. Kerosene also has numerous adverse health effects on lungs and eyes, as well as fire related burns.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Kiva loan will enable us reach over 1500 farmers with solar lighting and facilitate scale up of the program to other counties. The farmers will be able to get the solar lamps and repay the loan in installments after selling their tea to KTDA.\r\n\r\nPartnering with Barefoot Power (www.barefootpower.com), a Kiva field Partner in Africa, will enable us access quality solar lamps and allow us to utilize the expertise that Barefoot Power has gained since its inception and put those learnings into practice. \r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":50000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1494233,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2910,"youtubeId":"ECROztGhLIM","title":"Kiva Borrower Jaki from Kenya","thumbnailImageId":1494233},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy and sell Barefoot Power's solar lighting products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.816667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T15:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T15:20:20Z","loan_amount":50000,"lender_count":1420,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":50000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-30T23:12:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":648009,"name":"Agadhu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agadhu is a differently able man living with his parents, wife, and two young children in a small village in the state of Odisha in Eastern India.

She learnt the trade from her mother-in-law and since she started her business she has had very good results, as she has the advantage of being located near to a local educational establishment. \r\n\r\nHowever, a while ago she had to face the difficult situation of losing her father, who passed away, which led her to neglect the business somewhat and so the sales declined. But now, motivated by the need to continue supporting her family, she has started the work again and wants to strengthen her business.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is asking for the loan to buy supplies wholesale (vegetables, cornflour, chicken, fizzy drinks) and a large umbrella. This will help her to improve the business's image and she will also be able to produce more food to sell to her customers and satisfy their tastes. Thus she will be able to improve her income so she can continue to look after her family's wellbeing. \r\n\r\nFollowing her father's example, Natalia just wants to carry on providing for the family and so she works hard to achieve this. In the near future she hopes to expand her business to make it more profitable and so improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies wholesale (vegetables, cornflour, chicken, fizzy drinks) and a large umbrella.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-01-20T15:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T15:30:07Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natalia Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71396},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":73372},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75403},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77490},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79635},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":81839},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":86433},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88825},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91284},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":93811},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":96407}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-20T17:59:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":659285,"name":"Shaukat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shaukat is the age of 49, living in Lahore with his spouse and four children.

Happily, they have successfully paid back their loan completely and are now requesting for a new one.\r\n\r\nThere are four new members who have recently joined the group for this loan cycle.

She sells vegetables in her community market and raises chickens to sell as well. But, Benita has a clear vision of growing her business and having additional income. For this reason, she is currently requesting her first loan with Friendship Bridge. Benita will use the funds to start a new agricultural business. She will buy flower seeds as well as seeds to grow peas. She will also purchase fertilizer. Finally, Benita plans to buy more chickens to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nShe shares with much astonishment, \"It is amazing to know that many people around the world want to know my story and the story of the Trust Bank so they can support us through microloans.

It is full of friendly and hardworking women, men and children. It is one of the smaller towns in the department of Solol\u00e1 in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. The women of Santa Catarina work in various businesses including textile production, weaving and small businesses like mini bookstores and shops for the sale of items for daily consumption.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, a group of women united together and formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cCatalinas\u201d meaning \u201cwomen of Santa Catarina. Currently, there are eight women in the group with the goal of creating their own solutions as successful entrepreneurs thereby overcoming poverty.\r\n\r\nLidia is a 27 year old married woman with four children, who range in age from four to twelve years old. Although she only had one year of formal education, Lidia is keenly aware that her children need to have as much education as possible so that they can enjoy a successful future. This is a common desire among the clients of Friendship Bridge. Her oldest child will start the 7th grade next year while the others will continue in elementary school. Lidia is an enterprising woman who decided two years ago to start a bookstore business located in a small room of her own house. She lives right in the center of Santa Catarina Palopo and there is a lot of foot traffic past her business. Lidia is applying for a new loan with Friendship Bridge as she needs more financial capital for her business. She will use the funds to purchase inventory for her bookstore, especially various types and sizes of notebooks, books and other school supplies. Lidia wants to be well-prepared to have the necessary school supplies so that when parents visit her shop at the beginning of the year, her store will be fully stocked.\r\n\r\nAll of the women of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cCatalinas\u201d send an affectionate greeting to KIVA investors during this holiday season.

Kulpunai has a high school education and she is a very friendly woman.  She is patient and punctual in her business relations.  Her efforts at work and dedication speak to her desire to improve her family's living conditions.  As the main source of income for her family, Kulpunai raises livestock, which she started doing 12 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 15,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, she now has one dairy cow and one heifer on her farm.  In the course of running her business, Kulpunai has improved her family's living situation considerably.

As a way to remedy this problem and ease some of their difficulties, Miradija and her husband have decided to start a new business. Working together as partners, they will sell used technical equipment that they will purchase in some of the bigger western European countries such as Germany. These products will include, but are not limited to, televisions, freezers, fax machines, scanners and even tires. For this reason she applied for a 2,000 EUR loan in order to buy technical equipment.\r\n\r\nThey will then sell this used equipment in a local market at a higher price to make a profit on each item.  Since they are able to purchase these things at a low price, they believe that this business will be successful and Miradija is very happy that her first job and work experience will be as a business partner with her husband, which leads her to feel confident and secure about their decision.

The money will be invested in buying a shampoo chair, a work station, mirrors, dryers, and hair straightener, as well as to decorate the space. This way, she will be able to start her productive project with which she hopes to improve her family's finances.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Beatriz will be making one of her main dreams come true. She is aware that the biggest challenge is to position the business and become known in the area, attracting new customers and earning the loyalty of the ones she has with quality service. She will be able to offer her children a better well being, education and quality of life. She will also spend more time with them.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a shampoo chair, a work station, mirrors, and hair straighteners, and to pay for the installation and decoration of the space.

Over these years of hard and tireless work, they were able to run their farm in a sustainable way. The livestock that they currently own includes 18 cows, oxen, chickens, turkeys, and beehives. Antik also cultivates wheat, emmer wheat, and potatoes. Antik milks the cows and gathers milk sells to local resellers; and the other part is used in the production of cheese and other milk products. Antik and her husband work very hard to have a good income and sustain their living. \r\n\r\nBy applying for this loan, Antik asks for financial support to purchase an ox, a pig, and forage for feeding the livestcok.

This is his story: \r\n\r\n\"I decided to apply to the International and Business Law Program because I always felt that I want to help other people learn their rights, and because it is a respected profession in our country. I think it is vital to know our rights because it can assist in the fight against injustice and lawlessness. Unfortunately, Kyrgyzstan is very corrupt and lacks order. It does have laws, but they work ineffectively and a lot of officials in government change and use the law for their own personal purposes. All of these problems have slowly led Kyrgyzstan into total chaos. I am concerned with such troubles, and thus I want to try to change it for the better. It may sound ridiculous, but I really want to influence politics. To achieve my goal I need to become a lawyer to understand the basics of law creation. \r\n\r\nI want Kyrgyzstan to prosper and I want to try to stop or at least decrease the level of corruption and lawlessness. If we will not struggle for law and rights, we will end up like Afghanistan or Somalia because the chaos will lead to the destruction of education, economics, government, and finally the country. Kyrgyzstan suffered from two revolutions, and the reason for both of them was that no one, including the leaders, obeyed the law. \r\n\r\nThat's why I want to study at the International and Business Law Program: to protect my own rights and to help other people to protect theirs. The knowledge of law is one of the keys of survival in our tough world. I also hope that I can use this knowledge to help Kyrgyzstan.

Her elder son helps his mother to take the gathered harvest to an open market and sell it.
