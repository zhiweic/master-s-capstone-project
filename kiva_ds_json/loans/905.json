Her mother, who is her partner, lives in the capital and Lourdes sends her the products so that she can sell them there: \"Each time that I obtain an order of foods, I send it to my mother in the capital so that she can sell it,\" she affirms.  During the harvest season is when she has to take advantage of the opportunities to their maximum, since the foods cost very little and she can obtain a better income.

You could say I was born with a talent to carve, which I developed by merely observing my parents and relatives at work every day. My inspiration comes from Balinese customs and traditions. Competition is tough here in Bali, for there are many expert carvers, making the life of a carver a very uncertain one. It means that I must excel, so hopefully my sculptures will be well received.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to all of you who support me with this interest-free microcredit.

It's also consumed in restaurants or fast food outlets, which serve it with barbecued and fried meats. He makes his sales on a daily basis.

Owing to her parents' lack of money, Selmira was only able to study to high school  level. However, she would have loved to have studied to become an art teacher.\r\n\r\nSelmira has been working hard in her small hairdressing business for five years.  She works around eight hours a day and can serve up to ten customers a day.  She believes that her business is going well because she is friendly with her customers and, above all, she has a lot of creativity.\r\n\r\nSelmira is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy supplies such as dryers, aprons, highlight caps, dyes, etc.  This will enable her to have available all the materials she needs to carry out her work and improve her income.  This will allow her to continue working and fighting to make her biggest dream come true: to provide her daughter with a profession."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1140065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to

At the moment, Cody employs one other person besides himself to assist with his work load. Through the Accion Texas Inc. loan, Cody will soon hire a third HVAC specialist. \r\n\r\nUpon certification from the Federal Aviation Academy, where he learned to properly work on HVAC systems, Cody decided to open his own business for the freedom he would gain as opposed to working for a corporation. Though the academy offers more courses in aviation, Cody decided to work on an HVAC certification because the Texas heat will keep his business in demand. \r\n\r\nWhen starting his business, Cody realized he would need more funds to get on track with what he wanted to do. He then went to a bank to try to get a loan. The loan officer said he would not qualify and referred him to Accion Texas. \r\n\r\nThe Accion loan will help him gain more work than he can handle, Cody said. And that's a good thing! Without the loan, Cody said CW's A\/C Inc. would have grown much slower. What differentiates his business from others within the area is that \"I'm just honest with folks,\" Cody said.

Multinivel (multi-level marketing) diet, Myrna (left) and Alma (right) invested in the company. Registered as AM Healthy People Independent Distributor, with A and M representing their first name initials, the company helps people decrease blood pressure and body fat through 27 natural supplements customers may chose from based on their body's needs. Myrna says she decreased her blood pressure back to normal and lost 45 pounds. \"It was a healthy weight loss,\" she says. \n\nThe women opened a store to service the El Paso community through Healthy People products. Myrna and Alma's business began Oct. 2011 but was registered in January 2012. As the only employees, they plan to hire a cashier and delivery driver after a year and a half as they cannot afford to now. Until then, Myrna and Alma fill the vacant positions. \n\nMyrna learned of Accion through the NYSE Small Business Resource Tour. Upon approval, Myrna and Alma decided to purchase enough inventory to last for multiple months, and if need be, distribute to other Healthy People distributors. \n\nWith their low-priced products, Myrna and Alma offer extensive customer service by setting up assessments that follow their clients' progress and well-being every two weeks. \"We take the time to know our clients and what their progress is,\"  Myrna says. Without the Accion loan, Myrna says she would risk losing customers due to not having products. \n\nTo view all their products, visit Myrna and Alma's website at: www.amhealthypeoplecotx.com Also,

He makes part of his purchases on credit and the other in cash, at farms, public markets, wholesale suppliers, etc.  He has built a customer base around where he lives, which has a lot more market potential.  He also has kitchen equipment so he can offer fast food on weekends, giving him an extra income.  The only thing he needs for his new business is a hot dog cart.  This is why he is applying for a CrediKiva loan, his second through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  He will use it to buy fish, groceries, cleaning products, sleepwear and a fast food cart.\r\n\r\nHe used the previous loan to have more liquidity to make his purchases in cash to get better discounts and increase his turnover.

Her group is located in the lush, rugged Samana peninsula, an area with a nascent tourism industry. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their three children. \r\n\r\nEnercida is excited to be taking her ninth loan with Kiva field partner Esperanza International, after having successfully repaid her previous loan and growing her business. She plans to use her portion of this group loan to invest in her cosmetic catalog sales business, and will buy products such as deodorant, body lotion, perfume, and makeup.  Enercida also plans to buy \"Paca\" (packages of second-hand clothing) to resell.\r\n\r\nEnercida plans to save some of her profits in order to be able to build a website for her business.  She wants to improve her business, and the well-known cosmetics company she works for encourages its sales representatives to have websites.\r\n\r\nAs a member of Esperanza, Enercida joined a borrower group that includes some of her very good friends.

She is married to Orlando, her business partner, and mother to their two children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnaliza operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. Analiza rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnaliza dreams of being able to give her children a good future and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1144845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for additional computer units, spare parts and supplies needed in her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-20T14:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-19T14:10:12Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200.01,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3340.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303497,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5332.99,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356245,"comment":null},{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4267.04,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4454.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114343,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.96,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3340.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350391,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-20T16:45:24Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":451370,"name":"Saira's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saira assists her husband financially by doing decorative embroidery.

Rosa is a single mother: she has a 15-year-old son to whom she is both mother and father because her husband has abandoned them.

In her free time Rosa likes eating one of her favorite dishes, the delicious \u201carroz a la cubana\u201d (rice with fried plantain and fried meat). Owing to her meager economic resources she has been able to study up to the third grade of secondary education only, but she would have liked to become a fashion designer, and for this reason she works very hard so that her son can become a better professional than herself.\r\n\r\nRosa works day by day in her sewing shop, creating clothes as well as making repairs. She works around 10 hours a day and she can tend to up to 20 customers per day. She thinks her activity is going well because she is very kind and she always loves what she does.\r\n\r\nRosa is deeply grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she will be able to make some improvements to her house such as putting a cement floor, reinforcing the walls and other works.

She inherited the seasoning from her mother, who gave her lessons about cooking and how to have good sales.  She hopes to continue working to progress and to get her family ahead in life.

She is married and has two children who are in her charge. She studied until the fifth year of secondary school. She has been selling natacamales (steamed corncakes, a popular Nicaraguan dish) for 3 years. She started her business with her own money, earned while working at her previous job, a restaurant in the community. At 28, she decided to set up her own business with this money in the house where she lives. This is her first business, which she runs successfully on her own, since she is not helped by anyone. Arely says that she is satisfied with selling natacamales because it is a profitable business: she makes money every day and has many returning customers. She asks for this loan to buy firewood, sweetcorn, meat, onions, potatoes, etc. These are all the ingredients needed to make natacamales and give them flavour. She says that the loan will help her because it will enable her to invest in her inventory, increase production, and obtain a better income for her family. Her plans for the future include having her own home to be able to have a better standard of living and be independent. Her next goal is to establish her business in other places in the community, since she would like to become one of the most successful entrepreneurs in her area in order to increase her earnings and be able to give her children a better education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1140915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Tamara fattens up cattle and makes and sells dairy products.  Besides this, she always has milk at home, which makes her children happy and full.  She used her first loan to purchase one cow, which helped her to increase the livestock headcount.  This is her primary source of income, and, thanks to this business, she significantly improved her life.  She wants to use this loan to purchase livestock and continue developing her business.

","en":"Gavhar is a woman with a higher education.  She has a family, children and a loving husband.  Gavhar works as an elementary school teacher at a private school.  She has plenty of work experience and tenure, loves and knows her trade very well.  Her husband has been working at a mill for several years and has a permanent job.  Despite the fact that they both work and have a stable income, the family has not been able to save money to build their home.  They need to build additional rooms for their sons because they have grown up and will soon be married.  Gavhar and her husband decided to request a loan from us for these expenses.  This is not her first loan, and she already knows all of the financing conditions and never violated them.  Gavhar tries to use the loans as intended and to repay them in a timely manner."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1142079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Of course, everyone in the family works and earns an income, but still the family resources are only enough for basic living expenses.  It is impossible to save money, and this is why Zarrina requested a loan from our organization in order to cover large expenses.  She used her first loan to make repairs to her apartment before her sons' weddings and repaid that loan timely.  Then, she obtained a loan for the wedding.

Shortly afterwards, he decided to buy premises in the bay area of the city.  This area is very well known for being a commercial niche.

He works with a helper since he needs one for the cutting and assembling of the pieces since they are fragile.

Pho has been in these businesses for five years and typically earns in the neighborhood of USD 3.20 per day.\r\n \r\nPrior to this loan, Pho had borrowed and paid off three loans already. Those loans were very helpful and had good impact in developing her family-owned businesses and her living conditions. And now, Pho would like to take out another loan of USD 1,000 to purchase a motorcycle both for business and home use. Her husband will use it to provide transportation services to local people. Pho believes that through the help of the loan her family will be better off gradually.

She and her husband--who, for now, is unemployed--live in a house that they own, along with a son, his wife and their two children.  Juana has ten children, all of whom are grown now.\r\n\r\nJuana operates a fruit and vegetable sales business in a space that she's set aside at the front of her house.  She has many customers who rely both on the freshness of her products and her cheerful service.  The business suits her because she likes meeting her customers and sharing a laugh with them.  She has operated the business for 2 years and lost money at first because her fruits and vegetables often rotted before she could sell them.  Over time, she learned the business and says that she's doing much better now.  For the future, she would like to open a small shop where she can sell platanos without worrying that they'll rot in the region's hot climate before she can sell them.\r\n\r\nThis is Juana's fourth MFP loan and she says that she is grateful for your support because it will help her to carry on her business.  She wants the other members of her community bank to view her as a reliable member and she is committed to repaying this loan in the agreed-upon time.  \r\nJuana will use your 1000-soles loan to stock her business with different kinds of platanos because that's the product she sells that is most in demand.

agricultural business for ten years.  He leases a plot of land in the Kadjaran village in the Syunik region, where he grows vegetables and fruits, primarily potatoes, for sale.  Vardan also grows fruits, such as pomegranates, figs and peaches, in the city of Meghri.  He sells fruits and vegetables in the cities of Yerevan, Kapan and Kadjaran.  Vardan also has a cultivator, with the help of which he plows soil for the residents of Kadjaran for pay.  Vardan wants to buy a manual grass mower, which would allow him to cut hay also for pay in order to increase his family's income.  This is why Vardan needs a loan in the amount of 650,000 dram.  Vardan is 46 years old, and he lives in Kadjaran with his wife, daughter and son.  Vardan's wife works at a Kadjaran factory, daughter recently finished school, and son still attends

She and her partner, Moises, a merchant, have four children.  They live in a house that they scrimped and saved to buy.\r\n\r\nLoida operates a corner grocery where she sells the everyday products that her customers want.  She used her own savings to start the business 4 years ago and operates it now from a space in her house.  She saw that there was demand for a grocery in the neighborhood and she's grown it with MFP loans.  Her son helps her with the business.  She tells us that she likes owning her own business because it provides an extra income for paying household bills and making improvements to her house.  Her biggest problem is the weather.  Rain is common here and the roads turn to mud when they're wet, something that makes access to her store difficult.  She never lets problems get her down, though.\r\n\r\nThis is Loida's fourth MFP loan and she says that she is grateful for your support because it will help her to carry on her business.  She is committed to repaying this loan in the agreed-upon time, just as she's done with past loans.  Loida will use your 4000-soles loan to buy bulk supplies of the products she sells--rice, sugar, cooking oil, pasta, etc.--so that she can get them at the lowest cost.

","en":"Muhabat is a resident of the Qubadiyon district.  She is 45 years old and lives with her husband, who is retired.  Their sons are working abroad.  Muhabat does not want to wait for her children to help her and intends to start her own business.  Her husband supports her decision.  Muhabat leased a retail outlet at the district's central market.  She wants to get involved in selling children's and adolescent clothing.

He loves his wife very much, and she helps him at their bakery business. They have two children who are in school. Several years ago, they opened a bakery in the front portion of their house, where they have a display case and window to show and sell products. At the back of the house is the oven. Luis begins work at 3:00 in the morning to prepare and bake his products, and he does not close the bakery until 11:00 at night. His bakery is open every day of the week, and he works very hard by himself to knead and make all the dough necessary for his baked goods. When the items are ready to go in the oven, his wife helps him. He learned this craft from one of his family members, and since he liked their business, he decided to open a business of his own.\r\n\r\nLuis has not had major setbacks, not even from crime and vandalism, or from the Ministry of Health, whose permission is necessary to obtain operating permits.

She is a woman who has always worked hard to do well in life.  Her partner is Luis, a motor mechanic.  The couple have five children who are already grown up and live independently.  Esther currently lives in her own home together with her partner, two of her daughters and one of their partners.\r\n\r\nEsther works as a dressmaker.  She designs clothing and sews to order.  Her work is very much in demand in her neighborhood as she is the only person who does this work.  She learned the business from her mother at a very young age and also studied at a vocational center.  She now has her own workshop.  Esther started out with one sewing machine more than 44 years ago and has been working alone up to now.  She still recalls that when she started out she had a lot of doubts and difficulties but, thanks to her efforts and hard work, she was able to make progress.  In addition, she also rents out rooms and commercial premises.\r\n\r\nThis is Esther's 17th loan from MFP and she hopes to continue achieving her goals.
