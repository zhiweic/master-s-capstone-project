She is married and the mother of a large family (one daughter and four sons). Kurbantaaji has graduated from a technical college and is an accountant by trade. At present she works as an accountant in a hospital. She has 36 years of work experience. Her colleagues describe her as a responsible, goal-oriented and thoughtful person. Her husband and children help her out in the household. She has a tight-knit family, with a very good family climate. As an additional source of income for her family, Kurbantaaji has been raising livestock for many years, having launched this business with a starting capital of 1,000 KGS. Thanks to Kurbantaaji\u2019s hard work, she now has four dairy cows and 20 sheep. Her farm brings in about 10,000 KGS per month from sales of dairy products, which is the main source of covering costs of food and basic needs for her family. The income from her farm has allowed Kurbantaaji to raise her children and help them get started in life. In order to develop her farm further, Kurbantaaji has applied to the Bai Tushum & Partner microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy cattle. Kurbantaaji plans to invest her revenues into a further growth of her farm. In the future, she also plans to save enough money to be able to pay for her youngest son\u2019s wedding.

The members are involved in several trades, including seafood, agricultural products and 'minimarkets' (convenience stores). \r\n\r\nAna has a minimarket business which she started 4 years ago. It was an investment she made with severance money received from a previous job. Before leaving her job, she had decided that she wanted to work for herself and spend more time at home. She tells us that at the time she was only able to buy a carton of eggs, some drinks and some candy. She has recently experienced some difficulties as the winter has been very harsh, leading to increased unemployment and therefore her sales have not increased much, however she remains hopeful that everything will work out. \r\n\r\nAna is seeking this loan to purchase ice creams and beverages to stock her store, and believes that her business to do very well.

He has been working for two and a half years as a salesman in a store. When he finished high school, he was offered the opportunity to work there and did not think twice to start, despite his lack of experience. This is currently his only activity. His workplace is located 3 km away from home, but he travels to nearby cities as part of his job. He works from 7 am to 5 pm.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy a motorcycle, which will be useful since it will make it easier for him to go to work. Sometimes, unplanned things happen and he has to go to the city using public transport, which is an irregular service. This takes him all day.

She hopes that the loan will enable her to keep her son in university to pursue the degree so as to find a good job after graduation and also help her to relieve her financial burdens.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1411903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay for the school fee of her son to study nursing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kandal Province, Ksach Kandal District ","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T13:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T13:40:07Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cheang ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-23T15:09:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596482,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 50-year-old Julia from Liberia.

In particular, he owns three milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese production. The cheese is sold at the local open market. Besides, the family cultivates a small plot of land where various vegetables are grown. Zurab and his family members work hard all day long to earn their living but their existing income is not enough to cover food and everyday expenses of such a large family.\r\n\r\nThat is why,Zurab decided to start his own business. All of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Zurab applied for the credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of a start-up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva.

Thanks to her persistent character and hard work, Minara has on her farm: six dairy cows and 15 sheep. Her farm brings in about 6,000 som (KGS) per month. Income from farming allowed Minara to further increase the number of livestock on her farm.\r\n\r\nToward the goal of further developing her farm, Minara turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves. \r\n\r\nMinara plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her farm, and in this way in the future intends to buy a family vehicle."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1411664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"May village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T14:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T14:30:04Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T07:19:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596498,"name":"Thuy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thuy, 35 years old, is married and has one child.

meet 35-year-old Siah from Liberia. She operates a cook shop (restaurant) which sells 'fufu' (mashed manioc), rice, and soup in the Paynesville South area of Liberia.  It is a suburb of the capital city of Monrovia and one of the most populated areas in Montserrado County.  The area boasts one of the best standards of living in the county with affordable rents, good roads, access to water and lots of transportation options. \r\n\r\nSiah is single and has a three-year-old child who stays at home.  She completed 12th grade.  She describes herself as a hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nSiah has been running this cook shop for the past two years now.  She works 10 hours, six days a week at her business.  Her greatest challenge is not enough income. She intends to use the loan to buy more rice, 'fufu', chicken, 'bonnie', dried meat, fish oil, peppers, etc. She started her business with a little money from her 'susu' (local savings).  She likes her business because of the profit she makes every time.  In the future, she wants to build a house.  \r\nShe wants to thank the lenders for supporting BRAC Liberia and its borrowers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":82.95,"image":{"id":1411924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"buy

She knows exactly what she wants and achieves everything with her own strengths, but also knows how to properly use and plan funds for achieving her goals. \r\n\r\nHer husband, a small businessman, also helps around the farm. As the main source of income for the family, Saadat has been involved since 2009 in raising livestock, starting this business with 15,000 som (KGS). She has quite a lot of experience in breeding and caring for livestock. \r\n\r\nThanks to hard work, Saadat has on her farm: two dairy cows and nine sheep. Her farm brings in about 6,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as the basis for food expenses and the household needs of the family.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her farm, Saadat turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase foals. \r\n\r\nSaadat plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her farm, and in this way in the future intends to make repairs on the home in which she lives with her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1411671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy foals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jany-Bazar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T14:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T14:50:10Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saadat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T20:11:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596504,"name":"Ngan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngan is requesting a new loan to buy a range of new products, such as household items and food, to restock her general store.

Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elvia es una mujer de 66 a\u00f1os, trabajadora desde que era una ni\u00f1a, pues al no poder tener acceso a la educaci\u00f3n secundaria, se dedic\u00f3 a buscar el sustento por cuenta propia. Est\u00e1 casada con Segundo un agricultor de 71 a\u00f1os con quien formaron un hogar siendo muy j\u00f3venes. Elvia vive con su esposo y su hija quien aporta para los gastos del hogar. Viven en el Cant\u00f3n de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. Los productos agr\u00edcolas m\u00e1s comercializados son granos como arveja, fr\u00e9jol, lenteja, haba y tambi\u00e9n varias frutas y verduras. La producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados abastece la distribuci\u00f3n interna y el excedente se env\u00eda a la Regi\u00f3n Costa en productos ya procesados. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nElvia se dedica desde hace 30 a\u00f1os a la crianza de animales dom\u00e9sticos como cuyes, cerdos conejos, pollos, codornices, etc  y adem\u00e1s a la producci\u00f3n de tomate de \u00e1rbol. Es un trabajo que le gusta mucho y por lo cual le dedica hasta 10 horas cada d\u00eda, paralelamente a los quehaceres dom\u00e9sticos en su hogar. Elvia ha adquirido la suficiente experiencia para paso a paso llevar su negocio hacia el crecimiento, sin embargo la falta de oportunidades de financiamiento no le han permitido surtir su negocio como ella quisiera, es por esto que ahora solicita un cr\u00e9dito con el cual comprar\u00e1 al menos un animal de cada tipo para incrementar sus utilidades y as\u00ed poder aportar con los gastos de su hogar y tener un ahorro conveniente para los gastos de salud que implican el cuidado a su edad.  Elvia agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por la oportunidad que le brindan de dar un nuevo paso de crecimiento en su negocio y motiva a los inversionistas de Kiva a seguir apoyando el emprendimiento y esfuerzo de las personas de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el mundo.","en":"Elvia is 66 years old, and has been working since she was a young girl.  She did not have access to secondary education, and decided to seek a means of providing for her own livelihood.  She is married to Segundo, a farmer who is 71 years old.  They formed a home together when they were young.  Elvia lives with her husband and their daughter, who contributes to the home expenses.  They live in the canton of Salcedo, located in the western part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces of the mountain area of Ecuador.  In Salcedo, there are various tourist attractions, like lagoons and spas, and they also offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main activity of the area is agriculture and, to a lesser extent, raising livestock.  The agricultural products that are marketed the most in this area are seeds and grains like peas, beans, lentils, broad beans, and different types of fruits and vegetables.  Milk and its derivatives are first dispersed internally, and the surplus is sent to the coastal region as processed products.  Raising animals is also favorable in this town due to the pleasant climate.  Despite these productive activities, there are worrying rates of illiteracy and poverty due to lack of basic needs, like a sewage system; only 25% of homes in this area have one.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years, Elvia has made a living raising domestic animals like guinea pigs, pigs, rabbits, chickens, quails, etc.  She also grows tree tomatoes.  She likes this work, and spends ten hours every day working while also performing household chores.  Elvia has sufficient experience to grow her business little by little.

Toktokan has a high school education. Her neighbors describe her as a friendly and responsible woman. After the death of her husband, Toktokan pulled herself together, steadfastly endured the loss of her husband and took the whole burden of the care and welfare of her children and the well-being of the family as a whole. Her elder daughter is married and lives separately. Her son and younger daughter live with their mother. As the main source of income for her family, Toktokan has been engaged since 1989 in raising livestock and growing crops, starting this business with 1,040 som (KGS). She has quite a lot of experience with the breeding and care for livestock.\r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work, Toktokan has on her farm: two dairy cows, and also an allotment measuring 2.25 hectares, on which she grows wheat for sale. Her farm brings in about 5,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as the basis for food expenses and household needs for the family. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her farm, Toktokan turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) to purchase of calves for further fattening and resale. \r\n\r\nToktokan plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her farm, and in this way intends in the future to complete the construction of a cattle shed."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1411677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Shaty village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Toktokan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-27T18:27:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596496,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva is a 34-year-old lady who is applying for a loan of UGX 600,000 in her first loan cycle.

She is seeing good results and hopes in the future to open a beauty salon in her home and be able to care for her customers comfortably.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with Kiva.  She feels grateful for the financial support that she receives to move forward.  She promises to make her repayments on time.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 800 nuevos soles, she will purchase material to make her bracelets, necklaces, and earrings, and also purchase nail polish.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":192.53,"image":{"id":1415688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase nail polish and materials to make earrings, necklaces, and bracelets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":127.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":136.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":141.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":144.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.01,"local_amount":122.68,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":129.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865266,"comment":null},{"amount":47.71,"local_amount":127.25,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":134.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353639,"comment":null},{"amount":47.54,"local_amount":126.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":134.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905399,"comment":null},{"amount":51.27,"local_amount":136.72,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":144.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091387,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-23T20:55:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598688,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mario, se le presenta la necesidad de adquirir un nuevo cr\u00e9dito porque requiere de m\u00e1s capital de trabajo para el cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol; esta inversi\u00f3n le ayudara a comprar los insumos agr\u00edcolas necesarios, tales como: herbicidas, pesticidas, plaguicidas, insecticidas, abono, entre otros.\nEl cr\u00e9dito anterior le ayudo al fortalecimiento del negocio y con las ganancias ha logrado aportar a su familia.

She got involved in breeding livestock over 34 years ago, having started this business with 5,000 som (KGS).  Today, thanks to her persistence and drive, she earns a monthly profit in the amount of 6,000 som (KGS).  Her husband provides delivery services to people and also helps with the business.

","en":"Matluba has long dreamed of engaging in some kind of business, but in the past has had neither the resources nor any kind of support. When she got married and had children, she had to think now only about herself but also about the future of the children. After consulting with her husband, she started to sell different kinds of children's clothing. She did not have a trade stall and her working capital was quite small. She had enough strength and patience to increase her working capital with the help of her activities, supporting her husband and relatives. \r\n\r\nFor the past seven years, Matluba has been trading various kinds of children's clothing and shoes.

cucumbers and tomatoes. He has a large plot of land where several greenhouses were constructed. 15 years ago, when Aleksandr was just married, he had only an empty plot of land. Every year after the harvest, Aleksandr tried to install a new greenhouse. During this time, Aleksandr had success in his business and now he has eight heated greenhouses.\r\n\r\nAleksandr plans to invest 20,000 hryvnia in the acquisition of plastic film and fertilizers and in greenhouse repairs.

Given the lack of employment opportunities and the difficult economic situation in which her family found itself, she decided to look for options to generate income on her own. As a result, a few months ago she began her own business selling clothing. She uses a small space in her house as her shop, which she fixed up to have a small counter and rack to display her products. She now has the opportunity to sell to people who pass by her home, and in this way earns enough income to help her husband with their home expenses. Gladis is an entrepreneurial woman, very active, who puts in a great deal of effort into growing and improving her business every day. She hopes to someday convert her business into a larger clothing store, recognized in her region. \r\n\r\nFor this reason she is asking for a new loan, which she will invest in the purchase of merchandise (blouses, jeans, underwear), taking advantage of the discounts available for buying in bulk. This way, she will be able to offer a variety of items that satisfy her clients' needs. She will be able to improve her sales and therefore her income, with which she will be able to provide a greater level of wellbeing and quality of life for her family.

Her variety store has been running for 13 years now and it keeps on growing. She also has a direct selling business for additional income. \n\nSusan would like to apply for another 40,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help cover her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \n\nSusan hopes for continuous growth in her business as well as in her spiritual life.

The level of poverty in this region exceeds 50%, however the majority of residents have at least basic services such as housing. \r\n\r\nCarlos inherited his entrepreneurial spirit from his mother who learned to raise chickens for later sale. Carlos dreams of having his own car with which he can move between villages, helping him with his animal sales. However, in in order to achieve this goal he must increase his production, and to do so must buy baby chickens and begin to raise them - selling them once they have grown and gained weight.

Some of the work she does is making sheets, pants, pillow cases, etc. She is a very self-sacrificing person, who works to help her family and takes care of their daily needs. \r\n\r\nMaria is requesting this loan to purchase knit fabrics, which will help her define and implement her business plan, which in turn will help her improve her income.

She has spent her whole life in the countryside where her parents taught her about farming. As a result of this background Rita today raises and sells pigs. The money she earns pays for basic household necessities as she is solely responsible for these items since the death of her husband. Rita says that her age doesn't prevent her from working hard; on the contrary, her work makes her feel useful. She goes to work every day alternating between her farm duties and her other job selling propane tanks.

He said, \"This is to tell business stories to the world.\" Jonathan is a 48-year-old man who stopped his education right after he obtained a high school diploma. He decided to do business to make some money to improve his living conditions, so he asked and got a little money from his father to establish his business. Now he runs a shop which sells cement in the area of Gbarnga, which is the capital city of Bong County and is well known as the centre point of Liberia. He requested a 100,000 LRD loan to buy more cement for his business.\n \nJonathan D. mentioned his hard work and his seriousness gained him this business two years ago. His goods are always brought to his shop by truck, and a problem he faces is the road conditions to the shop. He opens his shop by 8am and closes by 6pm from Monday to Saturday. His customers comment most of the time about how helpful his business has been. He is the only one who cannot go out of stock,  his distribution to his customers is always on time, and he sells his cement at a minimal price. He is happy about his business because the business makes him popular and gives him more money.  \n\nJonathan D.is married and his wife stays at home. They have six children between the ages of 31 and 15. Among the six, only two are living at home and attending grade school, while the rest of his children are living on their own and attending some college. He is the one who assists them with money for their schooling. \n\nHe thanks BRAC Liberia for their support.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1086.83,"image":{"id":1404496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy more cement for his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Gbarnga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":182,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T18:20:08Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonathan D.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":15557},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16118},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16699},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":17302},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":17926},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":16398}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":202.24,"local_amount":15557,"processed_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":15673.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399751809,"comment":null},{"amount":209.54,"local_amount":16118,"processed_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T10:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":16238.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410021200,"comment":null},{"amount":217.08,"local_amount":16699,"processed_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16824.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419784318,"comment":null},{"amount":224.93,"local_amount":17302,"processed_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":17431.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429433018,"comment":null},{"amount":233.04,"local_amount":17926,"processed_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":18060.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439650238,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-25T15:39:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592534,"name":"Linda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linda is 38 years old, married with three children between the ages of 10 and 17 who are in school and living at home in the West Point area, one of the most populated and best-known markets in Montserrado County that is good at producing fish on the Liberian local market.

","en":"Roza is 48 years old, married, and is raising two children (one daughter, one son). She has a high school education. Her husband helps around the farm. The elder son works in a sewing shop and helps his parents financially; the daughter is of preschool age. \r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for her family, Roza since 1990 has been engaged in raising livestock and crops, starting this business with 25 som (KGS). She has quite a lot of experience in breeding and raising livestock. Thanks to Roza's hard work, her farm has: one dairy cow, one horse, 12 sheep, and has a plot of land measuring 3.0 hectares on which she grows clover. Her agricultural activities bring in about 16,000 som (KGS) per month, which is the basis of food expenses and household needs for the family. \r\n\r\nIncome from the farm allowed Roza to increase the number of livestock, and improve living standards. In order to further develop her farm, Roza turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nRoza plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her farm, and in this way intends in the future to save money for her son's wedding."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":314.12,"image":{"id":1412507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Nepali by birth, speaks the local dialect and has been married for more than a decade. Untiring effort and relentlessness can be seen with her life venture. She is the featured borrower member and is pictured with her hand raised. \n\nShani and the other eight members joined hands and formed the Chullou B Group. \u201cChullou\u201d signifies \u201ceverlasting\u201d in Thadou dialect, and Shani believes in everlasting relationships among the members. She lives in the village with the rest of the group members. The village is about 35 kms away from the capital town of Imphal, which is also one of the Northeastern states in India.\n\nShani runs a tea-stall in the middle of the area market. She prepares puri (deep-fried bread), toast and tea, and sells them. She is earning well and is happy. The tea-stall is open at the break of dawn and is open until late. The location of the tea-stall gives a lot of advantage for Shani, as the public transport buses and jeep parking is close by, and drivers usually stop at the stall for tea and snacks. The passengers, as well, feed themselves with tea and snacks while waiting for the other passengers to board the vehicle. Passengers start thronging in at the break of dawn, as they wait for the first vehicle to head towards the capital city. \n\nChit-chatting with her customers helped Shani acknowledge the need to open a grocery shop in the area. The surrounding villagers typically travel another extra 4 kms to the town market, spending an extra 30 INR as jeep fare, only to purchase essential commodities like salt, soap, cereals, etc. The generated income from running a tea-stall is insufficient to expand the shop with grocery items. \n\nShani wants the loan from Kiva to expand her tea-stall with selling grocery items. The plan of expansion of the business is to provide the nearby villagers with groceries and essential items. This will also make extra earnings for her, and helps the villagers to avoid unnecessary traveling to the town market. She thanked Kiva and WSDS for the support. And, says she will repay the loan on time and will continue to build a good relationship with WSDS and Kiva.\n\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in a grocery shop, piggery, weaving, clothes-selling, etc.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1403915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to expand her tea-stall and start selling essential commodities\/grocery items for profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lunneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shani Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-27T02:53:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":594269,"name":"Bushra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bushra is a 35-year-old married woman living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

We started working alone with a single machine making little dresses for girls\", Reme tells us. Little by little the workshop grew thanks to loans of an alternate finance company for a long time, after a long time with this other company she encountered Vision Fund and KIVA and decided to change. \r\n\r\nNow she is requesting a loan to buy fabric threads and stockings, she will also use the loan to maintain her sewing machines. She used the loan to pay for fabric and proved to be reliable, now she is very happy because she can make her deposit, pay on time and she will be able to deliver her orders on time. The uniforms she has made to date are because her customers came to order their uniforms and paid a deposit so she had the security of selling the uniform when it is made.\r\n\r\nIt seems that she will have no trouble succeeding with her business although she would like an embroidery machine so she will no longer have to pay others for this service.

50, is a teacher and farmer in Chibombo District, Zambia. For the past 5 years Christopher has been producing fresh maize and large quantities of watermelons that are sold to marketers in the capital city, Lusaka. He is asking for a Kiva loan so that he may obtain a water pump to be used to irrigate and expand his farm.\n\nAs a full-time teacher, Christopher has struggled to effectively irrigate his expanding farm. The addition of a water pump will offer a major change as he will be able to move water from his well to his fields in far less time \u2013 providing them with much needed water during the dry season. Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a water pump are quite prohibitive, even for someone like Christopher, who has an alternative income stream. Once he secures the loan, Rent-to-Own will deliver the pump to his farm and provide Christopher with training on how to properly use and maintain the pump.\n\nWith the water pump, Christopher anticipates that he can nearly double his current production of fresh maize and watermelons. He hopes to use his profits to continue to support his children\u2019s school fees and expand the number of chickens his family keeps on the farm.\n\nIt is for this reason that Christopher is asking Kiva lenders to help him secure the loan so that he can begin to use a water pump as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1416929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to obtain a water pump for irrigation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chibombo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":2610,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-23T22:31:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596442,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":863.85,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy one to five sacks of charcoal and one pile of firewood for resale.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"BF","country":"Burkina Faso","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":187,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112500},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112500},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112500},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":112500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.42,"local_amount":79500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":80306.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863522,"comment":null},{"amount":74,"local_amount":36000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":36365.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410140178,"comment":null},{"amount":456.33,"local_amount":222000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":224252.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429552686,"comment":null},{"amount":170.1,"local_amount":82750,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":83589.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777136,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-23T23:47:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596510,"name":"White 2 (1) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Audrey is one of the members of the group White 2 (1).

Nichoibong is short in height, studied until primary level, and runs a tea-stall for her income. Her tea-stall is also captured in the picture where the group member stands in the front of the tea-stall. She belongs to Olive SHG Group and is the featured borrower member for the group. She is pictured with her hand raised. \r\n\r\nAll the members live in the same village, and all are engaged in income-generating activity. The group was formed to encourage, motivate and be financially independent. The village is about 30 kms away from the main town of Imphal, and it is also one of the capital states in the northeastern states of India.\r\n\r\nNichoibong has been running the tea-stall for more than a couple of years, and before this she used to grow chives and sell them. The tea-stall is in the front yard of her house, and it is built with a tin roof, knotted bamboo and no concrete flooring. \r\n\r\nThe tea-stall is open at the break of the dawn and closes down at sunset. She sells tea, toast and puri (fried flatbread) in the morning. Most of the time she uses firewood and charcoal for heating, as the liquefied petroleum gas is expensive. The firewood is sometimes collected by herself from the nearby fields to save some income. She usually gets the supplies from the main city market, and she also purchases on credit from the village grocery shop. \r\n\r\nNichoibong prepares good tea with tasty puri and toast, which is the main attraction for the villagers. People buzz in during the early morning to have tea and puri for breakfast. At daybreak, elders hang out at the stall and kill time. Farmers also stop at the tea-stall in the evening when they return from the field to have a cup of tea. Her warm and humble nature attracts people to sit and have tea at the stall. \r\n\r\nThe generated income is mostly used to manage the family expenses, and the case gets worse when the credit repayment from customers fails. \r\n\r\nNichoibong wants the loan to purchase bags of flour and wheat, milk powder, edible oil and extra gas. With the stock list, she will be able to run the business efficiently without worrying about the next day. She will open an account and start monthly savings for the future, and also repay the loan on time. She is happy that Kiva and WSDS create a platform for women who need financial support, and she wishes them good luck.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in a piggery, vegetable-selling, poultry, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1409803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase bags of wheat and flour, edible oil, and stock for her tea-stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T20:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T20:50:06Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thoitakhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roimucham","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jatakhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thangmuring","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jianpui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nichoibong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoitakem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoitakcham","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paraem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thamchim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T05:21:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596598,"name":"Mwanajuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanajuma is a single woman without children.

Selling chives is her main activity to generate an income. The market town is about 35 kms away from the village where she lives. She marches towards the market at the break of the dawn, as buyers come early in the morning to get the fresh vegetables. The major population in the state uses chives in most of the dishes; thus selling chives is profitable. She shares that growing chives is easy, as the climate is suitable, there is no limited season for growing, and market demand never ceases. \r\n\r\nThe generated income is insufficient, as household expenses and educational expenses are high in this period. She hardly managed to save a small amount to purchase seedlings and grow them abundantly. There are times when she does not have a supply of her own, and at the same time with no cash to buy chives from the suppliers and sell them at a profit.\r\n\r\nWith the KIva Loan, she is planning to purchase chives seedlings with the right fertilizers. Hopeful and filled with delight, she shares that her plans to grow chives on a large scale have come true. She will try to grow chives the whole year round with no break, and try her best to have them sell. She says she will try hard to be successful and will also repay the loan on time.

The group members are orphans who lost their parents and have been surviving through farming projects. They range in age from 18 to 27 years old. They operate chicken houses and mushroom houses as their businesses, which are located on one of the member\u2019s homesteads. From the proceeds of their businesses, they will raise an income for their families. They would like to purchase 1,000 chicks and feed for their poultry project as well as mushroom spores. \n\nFarai (back row, left) Velapi (back row, right) are siblings who inherited the farm they work on after their parents succumbed to a chronic illness. The piece of land they own has infrastructure that their father had set up which include chicken runs, mushroom growing houses, piggery pens, and land for crops. The siblings have gone the extra mile and set up fish ponds on the land. They have been rearing chickens and doing some gardening on the land. Their vision is to increase their production levels and maximize the usage of the infrastructure they have to their disposal. In a bid to also empower other youth, they have allowed unemployed youth from their village to also use the chicken runs on their portion of land. This way they are also sharing skills with their peers. They intend to use the loan to increase the number of chickens they are rearing and also venture into mushroom production. \n \nThe group plans to increase the number of chickens they rear from 1,000 per month to at least 2,000 monthly over the next 6 months. With the reintroduction of mushroom production into their business, they aim to supply the local market as well as food outlets. They also want to avail some of their chickens to other youth in their village to use as a training site for poultry rearing so that more young people are generating income. They also would like to use the proceeds from their business to build their own houses so that when they start their own families they are not staying on the homestead they inherited from their parents.  \n\nPENYA assists borrowers with entrepreneurial skills training through the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) Program. PENYA also helps them form Village Savings and Loans Associations where they save proceeds from their businesses that will then become the future sources of additional loans and business investments. Finally, PENYA carries out mentoring and monitoring visits to ensure that the businesses are being run viably. Through linkages created with extension workers and some buyers, PENYA borrowers have access to further training in the production and selling of their produce.\n\nTwo additional people appear in this photo -- these are PENYA staff members.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1413602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase 1000 chicks and feed for their poultry project as well as mushroom spores","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Goromonzi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":299,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Farai B\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Velapi C\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tichaona\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prince \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-24T13:10:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596606,"name":"Norlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of five children, Norlita works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nNorlita has a pig fattening business in the Philippines.

My name is Alberto. I have been happily married for the last 18 years and have two beautiful daughters, Diana Guadalupe and Paola Guadalupe. Both go to school. I am a car mechanic and fortunately I have many recurring clients. I am changing my car shop from a place that I rent, to my house. By doing that, I will be able to save some money in the rent that I am paying. I will use the loan to refurbish the place. In general, my clients seek me, they tell me what is wrong with their cars, and I provide them with a budget. Once they agree, I start fixing the car.

At this time he is asking for 2,000 soles in order to buy organic fertilizer so he can nourish his crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":465.85,"image":{"id":1416488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T22:30:09Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Demetrio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":298.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":308.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":333.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":344.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":349.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":365.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.34,"local_amount":298.86,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":305.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865286,"comment":null},{"amount":111.94,"local_amount":308.8,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":315.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353658,"comment":null},{"amount":120.8,"local_amount":333.24,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":340.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905420,"comment":null},{"amount":124.77,"local_amount":344.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":352.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091408,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-25T19:38:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596612,"name":"Rachel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Please meet 39-year-old Rachel, from Buchanan.

Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante a pesar de que las estad\u00edsticas indican un \u00edndice de pobreza que supera el 50%. Sin embargo el gobierno seccional y la empresa privada han aportado para que sea una ciudad en constante crecimiento, es as\u00ed que recientemente se ha construido un aeropuerto y centros comerciales que han generado fuentes de empleo para muchos de sus habitantes quienes tambi\u00e9n conservan un esp\u00edritu emprendedor como es el caso de Edwin un joven esposo y padre de 24 a\u00f1os, estudi\u00f3 la secundaria y siendo muy joven se cas\u00f3 con Yolanda de su misma edad que se dedica al cuidado de su hogar.

It is the Capitol of a province that is part of the Sierra region of Ecuador, Cotopaxi and in recent years has developed significantly in a way that is considered one of the most important in the region thanks to the flower industry, mining, metallurgy, agribusiness, agriculture and livestock. In addition, there are businesses that generate interesting income, which makes it a commercial town with several opportunities to get ahead even though statistics indicate a poverty rate exceeding 50%. Despite this, the government and private enterprises have contributed to the city so that it is constantly growing. Recently the town built an airport and shopping centers that have generated employment opportunities for many residents who also maintain an entrepreneurial spirit such as the case for Edwin. \r\n\r\nEdwin is young husband and father of 24. He studied in high school and though very young married Yolanda who is the same age and works to take care of their home. They have 2 children who are studying in a public school and they hope to see them become excellent professionals.\r\n\r\nEdwin has been a vendor of fruits and vegetables for 5 years when he decided to undertake business due to lack of employment opportunities in his city. He really enjoys his job, so that no task is complicated even though invests at least eight hours a day from early morning until evening. This is where sales decrease and the products are exhausted. Each season of the year Edwin stocks products from his suppliers that are demanded in the market. The lack of capital and financing difficulties has been obstacles that Edwin has had to surpass at every stage of his business. However, he has always sought ways to have more of the fruits and vegetables that are highly demanded. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1415768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase seasonal fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1668.53,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":99.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":104.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":106.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":111.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":124.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":126.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":129.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.73},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596688,"name":"Los Amigos Empresarios Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cLOS AMIGOS EMPRESARIOS\u201d est\u00e1 conformada por  08 socios dedicados a diversas actividades del comercio minorista.

She has been interested in making clothing since she was very young, and for this reason she decided to learn the trade by taking various courses. These courses later opened doors for her in the work world. She has worked in various clothing companies, where she gained experience and perfected her technique. Her last job was in a large, well-known children's and babies' clothing company in which she worked for a number of years in order to later start her own business. With the liquidation of the company, she bought three machines and managed to obtain various contracts with third parties. In addition, she does clothing alterations and repairs.

She says that all of the economic responsibility has fallen on her, because the father of her son has never helped her economically.\n\nMarina is strong and entrepreneurial, and with a lot of effort she has provided for her son, who is her driving force in life and who motivates her to continue moving forward and to overcome the obstacles that fall in her way.

So he applied for a microloan and was approved.\r\n\r\nHe has used his loan to purchase quality ingredients for his menu items, repair and further improve his food truck, and pay for his one employee.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1412224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase quality ingredients for his menu items, repair and further improve his food truck, and pay for his one employee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"El Paso, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-08-24T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-23T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596719,"name":"Yasmin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yasmin is a 30-year-old married woman from Jabalia.

As time passed, the owner decided to hand the business over to Virginia.  She accepted and changed its name to Vicky\u2019s Cleaning.\r\n\r\nAs the current owner, Virginia saw an opportunity to employ her family when she receives larger contracts at commercial or residential sites too large to handle alone.  In the future, she plans to employ more workers whenever she can.\r\n\r\nBefore Virginia could accept contracts in larger offices and homes, she needed to purchase more equipment including a vacuum and cleaning supplies.
