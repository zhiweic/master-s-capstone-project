She is a single mother of 3 children, who are all now adults with their own families. \r\n\r\nShe lives alone in a house that she has thanks to a community project, which also granted her a small plot of land. This is why she now has a house made of wattle and daub and sheet metal. \r\n\r\nNidian currently earns a living selling fruit and vegetables in her community. She sells in the municipal park. Her business is an informal one but it has brought her many benefits. She has been selling in the park for more than one year now. In the past, she worked washing clothes for some people in the community, and was paid according to the amount of clothes she washed. She works alone because her children already live in their own homes. She buys fruits and vegetables in the nearest town, which she travels to by city bus. It takes her 30 minutes to reach her destination. \r\n\r\nNidian is requesting a loan from Credicampo to invest $300 in fruits and vegetables to sell in her community because the town festival is approaching and sales will increase with the influx of people to the different events.

She will use the remaining funds to cover personal expenses because she is currently applying for a stall in the new community market that will open in a few months. The loan will help her to be prepared with equipment and merchandise to sell from her stall. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Nidian dreams of building her own house of adobe and, God willing, out of cement blocks.

He is single and does not yet have the responsibility of children and a wife, so it could be said that nobody depends on him; he lives with his mother and siblings. For financial reasons he could not go to school past the sixth grade, after which time there came the need to look for a source of income to cover the family expenses. \r\n \r\n\r\nCurrently Fredy works as an assistant in a small hardware store, which is located 1.5 kilometers from where he lives. He already has more than two years of experience being an employee of this establishment, and he is in charge of making tiles, blocks, etc. He is also responsible for transporting the products they sell to the homes of their customers. It is his first job and he is very appreciative of the vote of confidence that he has been given to advance. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to buy a motorcycle. Fredy has seen the need for having a mode of transportation, in the first place for being able to transport himself from home to his place of work and vice versa, since occasionally he leaves very late from work and doesn't manage to catch the bus. He also says that it is important for him to have a mode of transportation in order to run any kind of errand for his family, and it would be easier to travel by motorcycle than bus because the first option is safer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dreams and plans of this client for the future are to make a home, have children, and have a job that allows him to cover all the necessities and obligations that this requires. He also aspires to be able to build his own house onto the house where his mother lives, in order to be more independent. This client is very aware of the importance and support that Credicampo offers with their loans, and he will make his best effort to always pay his fees on time. This way he can achieve the dreams to which he aspires. The loan will be a great help, to be mobile without any kind of inconvenience and to be able to get more done at his job from arriving earlier to complete his work obligations. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1516350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy a motorcycle.

Elmira has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide an additional income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 9 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Elmira's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and 14 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Elmira requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Elmira plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's continued education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1514915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kerben town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2832},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2915},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3087},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3177},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3270},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3366},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3464},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3565},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3669},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3776},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3879}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T19:55:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":659629,"name":"Bubinazira","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0411\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0440\u0435 47 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0436\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0411\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0440\u044b -

Her oldest son is working in Russia, daughter is married, and the rest of the children are being supported by the parents.  Bubinazira has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 20 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Bubinazira's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows and a 1.3 hectare land plot, where she grows cotton, corn, clover and potatoes. Her school-age children also help her with the business.  Her husband is involved in transporting heavy loads with his own car and has a set income.

One day she said that she was going to study that year and she  did her calculations of everything she spent at home. After doing the additions and subtractions, she realised that the children needed more things for school and so she decided not to study that year as she put her children's studies first. As the days went by she met people who spoke to her about the classes and how there were payment facilities. \r\n\r\nThis year she saw her opportunity and decided to study a course. In the future she would like to work in hospitals, because 2 years ago she worked in filing next to the emergency department of a hospital. There she saw that in healthcare there is a need for people who have a good way with others, who are unassuming and prepared to give a helping hand, since these are the occasions when people need help from others. It is important to look deep inside ourselves and realise that they are ill people with needs and difficulties and they don't have enough money.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this Priscila needs to study and follow up on her contacts in the area of health so she can have better work prospects in hospitals and clinics. This will enable her to bring up her children and provide them with a university education, since it is very difficult to get a good job without a degree. \r\n\r\nPriscila is grateful for the Kiva agreement under which she could be considered. She needs the support in order to achieve an important personal goal in life, as this has been her dream for several years.

Odinamo also plans to work in this type of business, but she decided to open a grocery store in her own city, Kulob. She already built premises for the store next to her home. What remains is to purchase goods and start selling. However, Odinamo does not have enough money for this, and therefore she applied for a loan. Odinamo has decided to purchase a broad assortment of food products for the loan amount. \r\n\r\nAfter having opened the new business, Odinamo will provide a job not only for herself, but also for the other sons.

Thanks to her hard work, she now has two milk cows, two steers and 10 sheep, and has everything necessary to care for livestock, including hay and feed. In the winter she keeps the animals in the barn, and in the summer she sends them out to pasture and hires a shepherd to watch them. Saparbu's sons also help around the farm, and her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Saparbu has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase cows for fattening and further resale at the market for a higher price.

sea por  lo que dice la norma vigente  en salud o por negligencia de las personas que atienden en la cl\u00ednica, la idea es mejorar la calidad en  atenci\u00f3n al usuario, por esta raz\u00f3n ella quiere estudiar esta carrera. \nPor otro lado ella necesita el convenio ya que es una persona de bajos recursos, y no cuenta con ninguna ayuda de la familia ya que ellos tambi\u00e9n son de  estratos bajos y se encuentran en zonas rurales, tampoco cuenta con ayudas del gobierno, por tal raz\u00f3n se le hace imposible paga el  estudio, por eso acude al convenio de KIVA, para poder continuar estudiando los dos semestres que le faltan para graduarse, ser\u00eda muy importante para ella obtener este t\u00edtulo ya que as\u00ed lograr\u00eda tener y brindarle una mejor calidad de vida a el

se ha esforzado por salir adelante, en este  momento los ingresos son de menos de un salario m\u00ednimo, pues trabaja haciendo turnos en un caf\u00e9 Internet, del cual ella debe pagar un arriendo, alimentaci\u00f3n, vestuario y estudio de ella, como  tambi\u00e9n del hijo, ya que el padre del hijo no le responde por \u00e9l, entonces a ella le toca todos los gastos sola, el primer semestre ella lo hizo gracias a un descuento que tenia, pero ya para los dem\u00e1s semestres se acab\u00f3 la ayuda. \nElla  vive con el hijito no m\u00e1s en una pieza en arriendo ya que los ingresos no le

An administrator gives guidance and provides solutions when, for various reasons, some patients cannot be treated or there is an unwillingness to treat them. This may be because of the current rules of the health system or because of neglect by people who work in the clinic. The idea is to improve the quality of the service for the patient and this is why she wants to study this course. \r\n\r\nAt the same time she needs the Kiva agreement, as she has limited income and does not have any family help since they come from the lower social classes and live in rural areas. She gets no government help either, which makes it impossible for her to pay for her studies. This is why she turned to the Kiva agreement, so she can continue studying for the 2 further semesters she needs in order to graduate. It is very important for her to get this degree as she would then be able to have and provide a better quality of life for her son and her parents, wherever possible. \r\n\r\nOn a personal note, being able to continue studying would be a blessing since she would be fulfilling one of the many goals she has. She would also have financial and emotional stability since she would have more work opportunities as well as the option to continue working as a professional in health administration. She would also have the option of doing a diploma in auditing and medical accounts. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Naidu has an enormous desire for self-improvement and in spite of her economic situation she has worked hard to make progress in life. At the moment her income is less than a minimum salary. She works shifts in an internet cafe and from this money she has to pay for rent, food, clothing and study for herself as well as her son. The son's father does not provide for him so she has to cover all of the costs on her own. She was able to study the first semester thanks to a discount she got, but now the help has run out for the remaining semesters. \r\n\r\nShe lives with just her little son in a rented room as her income is insufficient to pay for an apartment. She trusts in God who makes everything possible. She wants to finish her course because, as mentioned previously, by finishing her degree doors will open for new jobs and to continue studying. In the future she sees herself as a good professional, setting up a clinic where she sees herself working with her son and other professionals in order to bring about a change in healthcare since unfortunately the healthcare in Colombia is very poor. As mentioned before, her goal is to continue as a professional and really work hard to achieve all of her dreams."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1516381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay a semester's fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Naidu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T13:07:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650045,"name":"Osmar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Osmar es soltero, tiene 27 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Coronel Oviedo, y cuenta que tiene su taller de Carpinter\u00eda en el terreno de sus padres, y as\u00ed est\u00e1 trabajando para poder mejorar su vida.\nHace m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os habilito su carpinter\u00eda y venta de maderas aserradas, ya tiene muy buena clientela ya que hace bien su trabajo, realiza por pedidos y como le gusta al cliente.

In the future, Sani plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1516927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a young cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T15:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T15:30:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T16:35:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":660668,"name":"Diana Maritza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito 20 De Abril se re\u00fane cada 15 d\u00edas en el Cant\u00f3n Montecristi  conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

She is an old borrower at UGAFODE Microfinance having borrowed five times. She is 46 years old and very determined to carry on her business until she gets her dream in life. \r\n\r\nBeatrice started the business in 1999 and is happy that the business has grown slowly but steadily. She works seven days a week and works 12 hours each day. Beatrice believes that if she gets the loan money, she will re-stock the drug shop.

Thanks to Gulbarkan\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes one dairy cow an done calf, and a 1.5-ha [about 4 acres] land plot, where Gulbarkan grows cotton. Her business brings in about 10,000 KGS per month. In order to develop her business further, Gulbarkan turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan intended to buy calves.

He sells these crops in a town market and at a few organic shops in a nearby city. \r\n\r\nRa\u00fal is applying for a loan to meet multiple needs: the construction of a greenhouse; the purchase of heaters, temperature and humidity gauges, plastic bins and containers; to make improvements to his farm building; and to pay for vehicle maintenance. These investments will allow Ra\u00fal to continue his work and refine his operations in order to increase production, meet the demand for his crops, and boost his income. \r\n\r\nRa\u00fal's goal is to raise awareness in his community about the harm that results from the use of chemicals in traditional agriculture. He wants to encourage people to start consuming organic produce. Ra\u00fal also wants to fulfill his ambition to acquire his own farm and ensure its sustainability. He wants to grow a wide variety of clean crops that will lead to greater financial stability and provide his son greater comfort and a better quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1497937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to invest in the construction of a greenhouse; the purchase of heaters and temperature and humidity gauges, plastic bins and containers; make improvements to his farm building; and pay for vehicle maintenance.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Samvel, thanks to his farm\u2019s income, takes care of his family perfectly. He bought furniture for his house and a car for his son. Samvel\u2019s son also drives a truck that he uses to make private cargo deliveries and helps his father to earn their living.\r\n\r\nSamvel is asking for a loan 800,000 Armenian drams to buy a cow and winter tires for their car.

Thus there is a need for access to computers, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. He rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services.

He earns a minimum of 800 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, he is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. He will utilize the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts, and accessories needed in his business. \r\n\r\nJason hopes that his business will grow bigger and dreams to give a good life to his family.

Thanks to Mairambu's hard work, she now has one horse and 30 sheep, as well as a 3.54 hectare parcel of agricultural land on which she grows clover and safflower. Her business brings in about 11,000 KGS per month, which serves to cover her family's basic daily needs, including food. Income from the farm has allowed Mairambu to give her children a good education. With the goal of further developing her business, Mairambu has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase cows.

With the goal of further building the business, Fatima has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase wholesale food products and soft drinks to be resold in her store. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing turnover and to save money toward her children's university education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1499978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy inventory for her food store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-25T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4542},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4454},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4568},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4684},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4803},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4925},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5050},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5178},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5310},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5445},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5583},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5458}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.41},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T06:16:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":651068,"name":"Kanygul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0433\u0443\u043b 58 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 7 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0433\u0443\u043b -

We hope the success of Monyo\u2019s initiative will reduce the community\u2019s dependence on depleting firewood\/trees and consequently halt deforestation.  Also each biodigester installed will cut down expenditures\/expenses for the families which took the wise decision of such an investment.

is a 34-year-old married woman from the Moung Ruessei district, Battambang. She has five children, two of whom are employed as paid laborers in a neighboring country of Cambodia, where they expect to earn a higher wage than locally, while the remaining three children are under her care. Ram toils the land and grows rice as her main crop on around one hectare of farmland. She has been a farmer for more than 14 years.\r\nTo help improve her sanitation, Ram would like to request a loan to build a household latrine.

She works there every day from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. That is how she has earned a living for the last 4 decades. She has also been able to give her three children a college education. \r\n\r\nShe has asked for the  support of a loan to buy merchandise wholesale, such as blankets, jackets, ponchos and more. This will allow her to stock up with a wider variety of products and satisfy her customers' tastes, improving sales and her income. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda, driven by her dedication, hard work and perseverance, wants to continue working to be able to make her dream come true of acquiring her own home and fortifying her business. This will give her the chance of a peaceful old age with improved living conditions in the company of her family. \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1498202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise wholesale such as blankets, jackets, ponchos and more.

It also complements her studies.  \r\nHer goals are to apply all the information she learns, and that the institute provides, so she can assist people well and give them all the help they need.  She also wants to work hard to be the best at what she does since she thinks the most satisfaction a person can get comes from helping others without expecting anything in return.  \r\nShe considers herself honest, punctual, responsible, nice, outgoing, and respectful, with lots of good principles and qualities.  From the moment she starts the program she plans to acquire all the knowledge the teachers offer and investigate things in depth so she can be the best student.  This way she can enter the field able to provide a good service for all the people.  She would also like for people already working in the field to teach her new and different things.  \r\nKaren Lorena wants to be trained to work in different areas of health such as multi-specialty and single-specialty hospitals, government sponsored healthcare providers, and the public and private sectors.

It is very important for Vrezh to bring the car to working condition and continue taxi driving. \r\n\r\nVrezh has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nThe loan is very important for Vrezh and he hopes for lenders' goodwill.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1500027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to pay for repairs to his car and to purchase new tires.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan, Syunik region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-25T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T20:00:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vrezh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":16557.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":21249.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":22406},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":21650.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":22758.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":22595.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22941.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23513.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":23230.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24602.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24382.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":24580.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25456.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25520.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26322.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26312.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26826.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":26928.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27791.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27961.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":28274.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28951.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":29264.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29918.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650147,"name":"Digna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Digna es una mujer trabajadora y activa, a sus 44 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica a atender su propio negocio;

Her oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest is 4. Her husband helps with the business, and Ainiza is a homemaker, involved in domestic household and raising the children.  Her husband works seasonally at a vacation resort and has a set seasonal income.  Ainiza has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 14 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ainiza's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 bull and a 1.2 hectare land plot, where she primarily grows potatoes, plants cereal crops and sainfoin for household consumption and sale. They sell the resulting harvest to wholesale distributors.  Ainiza and her husband are proactive about vaccinating livestock to prevent diseases.
