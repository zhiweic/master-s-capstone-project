supplies eggs to the local businesses in Mombasa, which then sell the eggs in retail. He has been in the business for one year now and the business is growing. This is his sole economic activity and he has dedicated his efforts here. He is 29 years old and single.

He's 43 years old and has six children who attend school. He lives with his family in a rented house.\r\nHe has worked in water processing as a bottler for over seven years.

Due to a lack of employment opportunities and the difficult economic situation the family was in, she decided to look for ways to generate her own income.  A year and a half ago she started her own business and set up a store at home.  She sells family basket items such as cookies, eggs, coffee, sugar, bread, etc.  The work has given her enough money to support her husband in taking care of household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the business is that the store is located in a residential area where the purchase of daily consumption items is very common.  Ana is requesting a loan to buy a variety of wholesale products (coffee, pasta, grains, sugar, sauces, cookies, personal care and others).  She also wants to renovate the store (painting and electrical wiring) to give it a better appearance and offer more product variety to satisfy customer preference and needs.  This will help increase sales income.  \r\n\r\nAna wants to grow her business and keep it well-stocked so that in the medium term she can turn it into a well-known supermarket.

Though she had a slowdown due to inadequate finance, the demand for chicks and piglets is very high in her community, and she has a good site for keeping the animals. With these business activities, the community will have a supply of her commodities at low prices and the droppings from the pigs and chicks will serve as manure for her neighbors.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will support her husband in the education of their children by paying their school fees, provide her family with a balanced diet, expand her business and take care of other family needs.

She works by herself, but sometimes her sister helps her out. Magdalena is very talented. She writes poems and songs, and composes scripts for her performances. She is also a book author. It was difficult for Magdalena to get started. But thanks to her resilience she was able to promote herself. Magdalena has saved 5000 hriven to buy musical instruments (traditional Ukrainian flutes, psalteries, maracas, etc.), and children's toys. To perform her concerts she needs more materials and instruments; the more varied the concerts, the more often she will be invited to perform. WIth time, she hopes to perform abroad. Magdalena has long dreamed of investing her earnings into recording CDs with her songs; this is something she has wanted to do for several years."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":141.35,"image":{"id":1407011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical Instruments","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase musical instruments and toys for her shows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vinogradovo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46.363333 32.943333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-08-14T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-13T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":291}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.63,"local_amount":277,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":280.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410109704,"comment":null},{"amount":69.35,"local_amount":554.83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":562.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874579,"comment":null},{"amount":37.37,"local_amount":299,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":303.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440006051,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-15T09:39:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592862,"name":"Jargalsaikhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Jargalsaikhan, 35 years old, lives with his wife and three children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

Why he needs a new house is that during winter time, a Mongolian traditional ger can't protect his children from cold and as a result, his children got sick frequently last winter. \r\n\r\nHe has built a house foundation and done some other construction work, and if now he can buy necessary materials, he could finish his new house before winter, which will come to Mongolia in three months. He wants to welcome the new year with his family in a new comfortable and warm house full of joy and happiness. \r\n\r\nMore importantly, the new house will stop losing its heat and preserve energy and enable the family to burn less coal for heating, thus releasing less pollutants into air, contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

She mostly sells women's clothing. But just before the new school year begins, she also sells school bags, office supplies, and various school supplies.

His two daughters are both married and live separately.\r\n\r\nThe house in which Munkhbaatar lives, together with his son's family, has a deteriorated roof and windows. This makes the living space vulnerable to frosts and storms. With winter coming closer, Munkhbaatar is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT, which he will use to purchase shingles, vacuum-insulated windows, and fiberglass insulation. Using those materials, he can renovate the house and make a comfortable and warm place for his grandchildren. More importantly, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal for heating, so it will release less pollution into the air. The renovation of the house will contribute to Mongolia's efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual, who raised three children on his own with his hard work.

Malkhaz is a laborer at the local stone workshop, and his wife works at the milk factory. He requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up, but had no success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nRecently, Malkhaz requested credit from Credo. He was planning to restart-up his animal husbandry business, which he had stopped due to a lack of economic resources. His loan request was approved, through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with soft conditions to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to mainstream credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers,\u201d due to low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Malkhaz will purchase several calves and build a shed in his yard.

34, is married and has five children.

This is why she is asking for a loan to buy more products such as dry grains, instant food, sweets, drinks etc. She trusts in God that she will soon be given the help she is asking for and she will not have to worry about providing the daily necessities for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":232.85,"image":{"id":1409363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy dry grains, instant food, sweets, drinks etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-08-14T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-13T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thelma Claribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":45.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":48.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":57.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":62.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":67.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":70.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":57.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98.46,"local_amount":98.46,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":98.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411737546,"comment":null},{"amount":43.42,"local_amount":43.42,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":43.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419769828,"comment":null},{"amount":44.04,"local_amount":44.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T09:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":44.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430002242,"comment":null},{"amount":46.93,"local_amount":46.93,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":46.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":441329929,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T23:07:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592950,"name":"Mwanamisi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanamisi lives in Likoni, Kenya.

35 years old, lives with her husband and two children in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in a house on a plot of land. She has been teaching for thirteen years at a high school where she also graduated. Besides being a teacher, she also makes and sells needlework to local people. Her husband breeds cattle in the countryside and runs a cafeteria. She is requesting a loan of 2500000 MNT to purchase an electric car. The advantage of an electric car is that it contributes to cleaner air in cities because it produces no harmful pollution at the tailpipe from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The automobile will be used for transportation. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

She is married and has three children, between the ages of 8 and 18 years. Two of her children are currently attending school. Isatu started a business after her wedding, when she began selling groundnuts (peanuts) alongside the village road. She began her business, because she wanted to create a source of income to take care of her needs.  She says that the main challenge to her business is her lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan, in order to buy more bags of groundnuts to resell at the roadside. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business, and improve her standard of living. In the future, Isatu plans to expand the business even more.

A strong-willed person who alone manages to take care of his family members, he is requesting a loan of 400.000 Armenian drams to buy more cattle for his farm to enlarge his farm activities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":284.03,"image":{"id":1405812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle for his farm to increase his family's income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Ararat region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2013-08-14T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-13T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Artsruni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":21690},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":22860},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":23170},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":23630},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":23940},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24130},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24460},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25100},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25040},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25640},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25820},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":26170},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26570},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":26820},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27330},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":27630}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.79},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.42,"local_amount":44890,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T17:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":44916.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410185997,"comment":null},{"amount":56.48,"local_amount":23170,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":23183.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420145369,"comment":null},{"amount":59.7,"local_amount":24491.6,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:08:37Z","rounded_local_amount":24506.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429601372,"comment":null},{"amount":58.43,"local_amount":23970,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":23984.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439828337,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T03:07:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":595066,"name":"Hugo Rafael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hugo de 39 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su compa\u00f1era de vida y su hija de 7 meses en casa propia pero no posee luz el\u00e9ctrica, \u00e9l trabaja de ayudante en un cami\u00f3n que realiza viajes a los diferentes lugares que est\u00e1n cerca de su lugar de residencia con el pago que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, Hugo est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de una l\u00e1mpara solar ya que con lo que ganan no le alcanza para poder realizarlo, la l\u00e1mpara es una estaci\u00f3n de carga con energ\u00eda de paneles solares en forma de l\u00e1mpara que sirve para los hogares de zonas rurales donde no poseen energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica, con esta compra \u00e9l  y su familia se podr\u00e1n beneficiar ya que por las noches podr\u00e1n tener luz propia.","en":"Hugo, 39, lives with his life companion and seven-month-old daughter in his own house but does not have electricity.

31 years old, lives with her husband and two children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family used to live in a rental apartment. She has been running a pay toilet business at a bus station for five years. Her husband renders taxi service to local people for a living. Using her previous loan, she purchased a new automobile for her husband as the old one had become obsolete. This time she is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass and foam in order to repair and insulate her recently purchased old house.

Mamusu says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation and insufficient finances to expand her business.\r\n\r\nMamusu has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items like rice, palm oil and cooking seasoning.

She is mother to one child and lives with her husband and their children in a large extended traditional family in Kabo\u00efla II Sikasso (the Republic of Mali's third administrative region).\r\n\r\nFor around six years Monigue Dite Saran has been buying and selling \"pagnes wax\" (highly decorative and colorful pieces of fabric), sheets, shoes, brooms and embroidered fabrics. She carries out her activity from home and on a door-to-door basis in the town of Sikasso where she is in great demand from her customers owing to the quality of her products.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to increase her ever-growing customer demand, she decided to join the micro-finance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, three years ago. She is on her third individual loan with which she is planning to buy 15 \"pagnes wax\", 10 pairs of shoes of varying quality, five sets of embroidered fabric and brooms. She buys her goods locally and in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso) before reselling them door-to-door on a retail basis, for cash and on credit, to a customer base made up principally of women. The previous loans she has had have been fully repaid.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan she is expecting to make a monthly profit of 90,000FCFA, which will be used to increase her business, contribute to the family expenses and repay the interest on her loan.

She has a five-year-old son and the two of them live alone.  She received a full elementary education thanks to financial support from her parents who also taught her from a very young age to work on the farm as it was the family tradition.  Mar\u00eda and her partner plant and grow coffee and sell to neighbors and friends in the area.  The land they work on is in the same area where she lives so maintenance, care and assistance is easier.  The main challenge every season is to cultivate and harvest a quality crop by making it better each day.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda and her partner work hard to offer the best possible product and service to customers, because this allows them to attract more people to buy their product.
