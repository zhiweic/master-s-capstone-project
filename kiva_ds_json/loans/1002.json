She lives in her own house along with her partner, Octavio, and their four school-age children. Nerva's work consists of selling beef. She offers products derived from cattle, such as sirloin, steak, liver, hooves, legs, and others. She has the support of her partner, who accompanies her each morning to the Municipal Slaughterhouse where she buys the product in bulk. Nerva has to rise early because there are several buyers and if she arrives late she will find people reselling the meat at a higher price.\r\n\r\nNerva started this business because a neighbor passed on her stand in the market and from that moment on, she has been dedicated to this business. Nerva comments that her business is profitable, as people from all over the city come to the market where she is located and purchase her products daily. Those customers who own restaurants buy in greater volume and pay a better price.\r\n\r\nAt first, Nerva had economic problems. She did not have sufficient funds to launch her own business. Then, she took out a loan and used it as capital for her business. She hopes to keep growing and to own her own cattle in order to increase her profits. This will be her twelfth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She has a great desire to continue being a punctual communal bank member. She also knows that the others in her group are responsible people and they mutually support one another. She is grateful for the help with growing her business. With the requested 2,000 nuevos soles, Nerva will buy tools for her work such as knives, axes, grinders, aprons, etc. She is very happy because she will be able to better serve her customers and will have the necessary tools for her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1243275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy knives, axes, grinders and aprons","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-24T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-24T06:50:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nerva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2013.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577131,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

He was asked to be an assistant and since then they worked as partners. Now he signed a contract with a company that requested the construction of 10 chicken coops. He has been working in this business for 21 years. He considers this job to be profitable since he makes more and more chicken coops and is called upon frequently due to positive references. He had financial difficulties starting this business and could not afford the tools he needed. This limited his work but now he expects to stay in this business to continue making money. At the moment, this will be his 10th loan with the MFP Institution. He is very enthusiastic and wants to continue being punctual.

Her name is Aklimo.  She is 40 years old and is married with six children at home.  She does her best to stay on top of everything, from running her household to raising her children and also to starting her own business.  Her husband admires her, but he is not in a position to provide for her and the children's needs.  Aklimo has chickens which give the children eggs, but there is not even one egg left for her.  She should be able to give her children butter, dairy products and meat as well as clothing and education.  This is why she urgently needs to start her business and earn an income.  With this goal in mind, she completed the \"Get Ahead\" course organized by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She wants to start her business buying and selling livestock, as she has experience in this type of work.  With the income from her business, Aklimo plans on giving her children a good education and high-calorie foods.  She is asking for a loan of 2,000 somoni with which to buy livestock to start her new business.  She is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":199.12,"image":{"id":1242817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She has six children and has been doing this work for 19 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, crops, and her personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Gardening!' Her biggest challenge is 'Crop diseases'. She will use the loan to construct a dairy unit.\r\n\r\nLonah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Lower interest.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'I can develop myself through their funding.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

She is a widow with four children, and she is a very hard-working and cheerful woman who is always motivated.  She faces difficult living conditions, as there is nothing left from her husband.  She raised her children alone without any help.  Her children are grown, but to this day Oshurmo takes care of them herself.  She has very large expenses, as she needs to pay for her eldest child's wedding and her youngest child's education.  Besides that, the everyday expenses for food, clothing, mobile phone bills, transport and utilities fall to Oshurmo.  \r\n\r\nTo increase her income, Oshurmo plans to start her own business.

Her husband drives a tractor and she works as a teacher in a school, but receives a small salary.  Her husband's income is also not enough to provide for their family's needs, so Ravshangul decided to start her own business for the good of her family.  With that goal in mind, she enrolled in the \"Get Ahead\" course organized by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She wants to start a business buying and selling livestock.  With the income from this business, she plans to provide her children with a good education and high-calorie foods.  Ravshangul is asking for a loan of 2000 somoni to buy livestock to start her new business.

She is 42 years old and has two children at home.  Her whole life she has shone a light on a school, which is to say that she is a high school teacher.  She loves her work very much and does it gladly, but her salary is very low and every year the economic situation of her family worsens.  Her husband also does not earn enough money to support the family, which is why Tahmina needed to find a source of income.  After much thought, she decided to start her own business.  With that goal in mind, she enrolled in the \"Get Ahead\" course offered by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She wants to start her own business buying and selling livestock.  This loan will help her start her new business and it will also open the door to economic development.  If her living conditions improve, then comfort and joy will rule her house.  Tahmina is asking for a loan of 3,000 somoni to buy livestock to start her new business.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is extremely fertile for agriculture. She has four children and has been farming for 12 years. Her primary income sources are selling milk and eggs, growing crops, and transportation services.\r\n\r\nAnnlyne indicated that what is most enjoyable about farming is  'earning from the sale of milk!' Her biggest challenge is 'diseases in livestock.' One of the animals on the farm is named 'Lelmet'.She will use the loan amount specifically to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nAnnlyne was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'from  a neighbour.'  She was also asked about what she learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How to earn income from agriculture.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Annlyne replied, 'increased income to the family.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Annlyne owns the following: 'cow, poultry, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. Annlyne has the following items in her household 'mosquito net, solar power, TV' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine, DVD player'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and to send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":536.78,"image":{"id":1243289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

","en":"Akzyinet is a 40-year-old married mother of five. As her family's main income provider, Akzyinet began working in animal husbandry eight years ago. She began her business with 5,000 som and thanks to hard work and persistence, today she owns two dairy cows, two calves, 30 sheep and goats, and one horse.

In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone.

is a shrewd and hardworking young man of 27 years. He started welding immediately after he dropped out of school five years ago due to lack of school fees, and helped fund school fees for his siblings, who were still in primary school.

The advantage that Le\u00f3nidas has is that the coffee is at a good price and has a high demand. Le\u00f3nidas needs the loan that he is requesting to invest in the purchase of fertilizers and to hire labor. The only challenge that he faces are the different pests that harm the coffee, so he has to control them. His goal is for his children to be able to study and become professionals, and also to be able to have a bigger farm. This is the second financing that Le\u00f3nidas has requested from FAMA and so far he has made his payments punctually.

","en":"Nasipa is 60 years old and a widow. She has begun working in animal husbandry and raising crops, and this has become the main source of income for her family. In 2006, she began her business with a start-up sum of only 3,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) She has managed to develop her farm, which now includes 1 cow and calf and 10 sheep, bringing in monthly earnings of 3,000 KGS. On her land, Nasipa grows barley and straw. She fattens cows and sells them at the local cattle market. For the purpose of further developing her business, Nasipa has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 30,000 Som (KGS) to buy more cattle. She plans to use the extra income generated by this loan to re-invest in her business and, in the future, to renovate her home. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1242898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-11-24T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-24T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":20498.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754834,"comment":null},{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10249.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631509,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-25T03:17:35Z","paid_date":"2013-07-22T08:35:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":500562,"name":"Shamigul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0428\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0425\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d. \u0415\u0439 43 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0428\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u044c\u044e \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0428\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0438.

named Akmaljon needs your help, since his parents aren't in a position to pay his tuition.  Akmaljon is 19 years old and a second year student at the Tajik Technical University.  He graduated from high school with excellent grades and presently, he is one of the best students at the university.  His classmates and teachers respect him for having all the traits of a good person:  tolerance, intellectuality, and motivation.  He recently had an end-of-semester assignment, for which he got good and excellent marks.\r\n\r\nThis talented student isn't subsidized by the government and must pay his tuition every year.  It's difficult for Akmaljon to deal with the expenses of student life as he himself has no source of income and his parents work in government bureaus where they receive small salaries.  He is requesting a loan for $1000 for the payment of his university tuition.  This loan will help him by paying his tuition to finish his second year and move closer to his goals.  He is relying only on you and he promises to repay the loan on time as his parents will help him with

She manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \n\nMa. Maylin maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nMa. Maylin hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams of having their own house and lot. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband Dilshod is a very kind person and always tries to support Momagul, but has been very unlucky and unable to earn a living, despite constant efforts.

Momagul has decided to solve the family's financial problems through entrepreneurial activity that will bring her income. To this end, she took the course \"Bring it On\" organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained her graduation certificate.\r\n\r\nMomagul would like to start her own business of buying and selling cattle, as she has experience in this line of work.

Turguntosh had placed all her hopes in her husband and didn't find a job herself, but year after year their living conditions worsened. Turguntosh can no longer depend only on her husband, and has decided to start her own business cultivating crops such as potatoes, carrots, onions, grains etc. To this end, she took the course \"Bring It On\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained her graduation certificate. Now she is quite capable of setting up her own business and becoming successful.

To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 2002, having started this business with 50,000 KGS.  The main business focus is selling meat and milk.  Thanks to Gulisar's hard work, today her business contains four dairy cows and five bulls, and the monthly income amounts to 8,000 som.  Her daughter and husband actively help her with the business.  In order to further develop her business, Gulisar requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy two bulls and two cows.

is 38 years old and has continuously worked as a driver in the military since 2010: his wife also works in the military. His family consists of five members: his wife and three children. They live in their small wooden house in the ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads and erratic electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. \n\nBy saving money, they  bought a plot of land in a remote part of the city where they built their house. In winter, the heat goes out through the door and the house gets colder, so they need to use a coal-burning stove to keep warm. Coal burning is becoming the primary source of air pollution in Mongolia. \n\nTherefore, Delgerkhangai is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT so a small barn can be built where the house door opens outside. By doing this,  the heat loss will be reduced, he will burn less coal, and his family will live in comfortable conditions.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \n\nIveta requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. With the received credit, Iveta will trade in clothing.

She lives with her husband Jesus to whom she has been married for 25 years. The two of them have three children and they all live together. A year ago her daughter died of a illness. To obtain a cure she had to sell her guinea pigs which is sad for her to remember. Now she has only 38 specimens but she is working to raise that number and so she must build more places for them to live. She raises not only guinea pigs but also high-quality cows, bulls and chickens and obtains a profit selling the milk and the animals. In addition her husband works for city government where they pay him a monthly salary. On weekends the two of them plant corn and alfalfa on their own farm land. The alfalfa helps to feed their children but the corn is sold at their own farm since it is of very high quality and has its regular customers. \n\nNow she would like to improve the infrastructure of their home. She belongs to the \"San Lorenzo\" communal bank; this is the tenth loan with MFP and so she hopes for a small loan in order to achieve her objectives. Additionally she promises to make her payments as she did with a previous loan. Furthermore she is pleased to be a part of her association because all its members are responsible and mutually supportive persons. \n\nMaria will invest the requested money in the purchase of more guinea pigs to increase her herd in addition to constructing more pens where they may live. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1239817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase more guinea pigs and materials to build more pens.

Todo esto porque durante el tiempo que viene desempe\u00f1\u00e1ndose en el campo comprendi\u00f3 que mientras uno tenga la salud estable debe sacarle el m\u00e1ximo provecho con trabajo y alegr\u00eda, no olvidando que todo su esfuerzo aplicado finalmente esta reflejado en las ganancias que obtiene permiti\u00e9ndole ahorrar a largo plazo.\nActualmente planea realizar una lista de tareas para con sus cultivos el cual incluye el reemplazo de algunas plantaciones de hoja de coca por el de cacao debido a considerarlos algo obsoletos, este proceso requiere la compra de alm\u00e1cigos criados de forma tecnificada a\u00f1adiendo a ello el respectivo deshierbo de las plantaciones mas productivas del momento.\nDesea a futuro cumplir uno de sus sue\u00f1os que es la compra de una vivienda en la urbanizaci\u00f3n de su localidad puesto que es una de las cosas que siempre quiso en beneficio de su peque\u00f1a hija.

She has a nice life living with Wilmer, 28, and her one-year-old daughter, Maribel, who is her reason to live.  She lives with her family in a rented adobe house.  She\u2019s been growing organic cocoa beans for ten years which by the way is one of the best priced in the region for its unique flavor and aroma.  Her main, unfailing support is Wilmer with whose help she negotiates everything related to the crops; they almost always work from sun to sun including Sundays and holidays.  She does all this because in all the time she\u2019s been working in the fields she came to realize that as long as her health remains stable, she must get the most out of it with hard work and joy never forgetting that effort applied is reflected eventually in profits obtained that make it possible for her to save up in the long run.\r\n\r\nShe currently plans to make a list of tasks for the crops that includes replacing some of the coca leaf plants with cocoa bean plants because she considers them to be a bit obsolete.  This process requires the purchase of seedlings that have been raised technologically and she must add the respective weeding of the currently most productive plots.\r\n\r\nShe hopes in future to reach one of her dreams which is the purchase of a dwelling in her local residential area because it\u2019s one of the things she\u2019s always wanted for her daughter\u2019s wellbeing.  This will be her 4th MFP loan and she\u2019s grateful to be part of the financial institution and to have a good credit history.  She feels committed to the work the communal group has been doing because she feels motivated to work with people who are responsible and committed to their loans.  She will use the 500 new soles to add to her capital earmarked for seedling purchase and will use the rest to hire day laborers for crop maintenance and to weed the cocoa bean plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1244379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seedlings and to hire laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-26T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-26T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":54.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":70.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.95,"local_amount":54.88,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":56.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188930,"comment":null},{"amount":21.9,"local_amount":54.75,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":56.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572827,"comment":null},{"amount":24.11,"local_amount":60.28,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":62.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122486,"comment":null},{"amount":24.91,"local_amount":62.27,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":64.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868310,"comment":null},{"amount":25.73,"local_amount":64.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":66.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577137,"comment":null},{"amount":25.89,"local_amount":64.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529393,"comment":null},{"amount":27.42,"local_amount":68.56,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":70.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974515,"comment":null},{"amount":28.09,"local_amount":70.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":72.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995936,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-26T18:42:08Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":501352,"name":"Regard De Jesus 1,2, 3 & 4 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Macius est le coordinateur de son groupe Regard de Jesus.

","en":"Cholponai is 43 years old. As the main source of income for her family Cholponai has been raising livestock since 2000. She has worked hard to develop her business, started as a 15,000 som investment to now yield 5,000 som (KGS) monthly, mainly from dairy sales.

","en":"Barihan is a 47 year old farmer who lives in the village of Ak-Kolot in the south Kyrgyzstan. She is married and a mother of four children. Three of her children are adults and are taking care of themselves and their own families. Only Barihan's youngest son is still living at home. The entire family helps their mother during the spring planting season. Barihan has a calm, hardworking and responsive personality. She has been raising livestock since 1992 and the herd has become the main source of income for the family. After the fall of the Soviet Union Barihan received a plot of land from the co-op and also owns 30 sheep and 2 cows. In order to further expand the herd she has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She is planning to use the profits from this loan to buy even more livestock and hopefully marry off her last son next year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1244185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

He owned a coffee shop for 10 years until he sold it to his business partner, and he has storage and warehouse buildings he rents out. After he learned about computer software by working at his church, Destin took a class on technology. He said he saw an opportunity for business growth and decided to change industries. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Destin owns one kiosk and says he has the approval to set up in his neighborhood mall. He provides options for clients, including already-made kiosks similar to ones seen at major department stores set to accept job applications - and a way-finder, similar to ones in malls, with informational slides.  \u201cI think what makes my business so unique is that it\u2019s an outlet to release information,\u201d Destin says.  \u201cIf you pass a billboard on the street, you may not get all the information, but a kiosk is more intimate. You can read and take it in.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about Accion Texas Inc. in a radio ad, Destin applied for a loan to get his business started.  He used the loan to purchase a demo phone-charging kiosk to pitch his business to potential clients. The charging port takes 15 minutes maximum to fully charge a dead smart phone and comes with Android and iPhone connectors. Without the help of Accion, Destin says, the momentum of his business would have slowed down.\r\n\r\nThough his business was registered only a year and a half ago, Destin plans to purchase iPads to include in kiosks for doctors\u2019 offices, in which staff can obtain patient information and patients can make payments.  As his business grows, Destin plans to hire staff, but for the time being he employs himself and his wife.

She later managed to expand the capacity of her fields with Gabriel\u2019s help in order to consolidate her production and thus her income.  She does the tasks alongside her spouse and sometimes hires day laborers especially for maintenance and weeding because this is very hard work that has to be done collectively with a drop of care added to do said chores.  According to her, the motivator is the final profits earned since they symbolize the hard work applied.\r\n\r\nA short time ago thanks to much effort she was able to acquire an additional parcel adjacent to hers she plans to expand her cocoa bean crops into and to do so needs to have seedlings, organic manure and additional manpower to plant shade trees like banana trees and others.

She totally trusts her communal group because all the members without exception are people she\u2019s known since she was a little girl.

Jumber also runs a small chemist\u2019s shop and has a monthly income. Several times, he has asked for loans from local financial institutions to start his new business but without success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of income requirements and a lack of experience in new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers.\r\nJumber\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit. The program extends soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Jumber will cover the costs of purchasing his stock of basic groceries for starting a grocery store. He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Jumber will work hard and he will be able to improve the living conditions for his family. With this loan, his family will generate enough income to access regular available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event they need
