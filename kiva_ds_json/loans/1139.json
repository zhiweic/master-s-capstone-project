is a 56-year-old married man living in a small village in Lebanon. The highest education he ever got was elementary school because his parents could not afford more than that, causing a great handicap throughout his life. He lives with his wife and his two children who are under 18. His wife works in the farms next to their house from sunrise till dusk. Nimer was previously working as a blacksmith, but his advancing age and his deteriorating health condition forced him to resign and to look for another means of earning income. This is how he ended up selling coffee and tea from a mobile machine, which he moves every day from one corner of the village to the other.

She works for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week and says that her main challenge is inflation. She is requesting a loan to buy more bowls to sell to her customers. She hopes that the extra income she earns from this loan will allow her to buy a piece of land.

","en":"Crisley is a young medical school student, who is requesting an education loan to pay her school's tuition.  This is her story:\n\nMy name is Crisley and I am a young medical student in Santo Domingo. Three years ago it seemed like a distant dream to study one day due to the circumstances that changed my life and that of my family. I was diagnosed in 2009 with a chronic disease. I was admitted to the hospital several times and I was hospitalized for more than six months followed by surgery. Despite a few limitations, my condition has not stopped me completely. I attend university, I am part of a dance group, I volunteer with the Red Cross, and whenever I can I provide moral support for other people like me. \n\nI am very clear on my purpose in life and the goals I want to achieve. This includes becoming a great doctor of gastroenterology. I truly believe that everything in life happens for a reason and maybe this was all just the push I needed to know that my place is where I can serve, help, and turn my experiences into something positive in the life of another that has health problems similar to mine. \n\nI live with my parents and brother who is in secondary school. The entire process I just explained was excessively costly for my family. I still need things, medicines, and medical visits due to my condition. My family's financial situation can no longer support my university expenses. That is why I am requesting help in whatever manner possible to find a way to pay for my studies. Successfully completing my degree and graduating with honors is another dream I hope to achieve with the help of God. While there is still life in me I will continue striving to reach it.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1366215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \n\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have three milking cows, two calves and a pig. Nana produces cheese products for selling. Besides, they have a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees, bay trees and maize are grown. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price, but it is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \n\nNana requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Nana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \n\nWith her credit, Nana will begin trading fruits and vegetables. She plans to purchase fruits and vegetables at wholesale prices. Nana's son will transport them to buy at higher prices. This will increase their income.

","en":"Sharof is a cheerful man, 55 years of age.  He is married and is a father to six children.  Sharof and his wife live in harmony and try to raise their children to be good people.  His two older sons already have their own families.  Sharof and his wife are very happy to raise their grandchildren.  To earn a living, Sharof runs his own business.  For the last two years, he has sold fruits and vegetables.  Previously, he worked in farming but then he decided to sell his own crops.  He uses his own vehicle to transport his crops to a market in the city to sell.  At the market he also buys other types of fruits and vegetables to sell back in his village.  This business brings in consistent income.  Now, Sharof wants to expand and build a small counter near his home where his wife will sell different types of fruits and vegetables.  For this reason he wants to take out a loan to buy a large assortment of fruits and vegetables.  For this loan, he turned to Arvand and he hopes for a positive outcome.

She started her business to help with the daily survival for her family.\r\n \r\nJegbeh runs a cookery business. She sells cookery at her house and she has been running this business since 2005. She works at the business from 4:30; she will not rest until the food is finished. Jegbeh says that the main challenge to her business is the problem of price control in the market.\r\n\r\nJegbeh has requested a loan in order to food commodities like cooking seasonings, oil, and rice. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. In the future, she plans to have a permanent business residence. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":158.24,"image":{"id":1366062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her major challenge is insufficient capital to run her business. \r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy more cigarettes, soap, milk, gari and sugar for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to repay her loans and pay her children\u2019s school fees. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to become a wholesaler in the fish business.

She purchases clothes from different areas and sells them for a profitable amount. \n\nParveen is a responsible mother of 5 children. Her husband makes his living as a daily worker, but his income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family members. She faced many problems in her early married life, but now her contribution to the family income is playing a vital role in fulfilling the needs of the family members.\n\nTo cope with the increasing demand during the summer season, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a variety of clothes in different colors. She hopes to get an increase in her net income and wishes to spend part of the profits on the improvement of her house. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

The members of the communal bank run a variety of businesses, including cosmetics sales, recycling, sales of Avon products, food sales, sales of sundry items, vegetable sales, flower sales and sales of lamb. \r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit small micro-businesses where Angela is a member. She says that this is her second loan cycle with Pro Mujer. She joined the group at the invitation of a consultant from the institution, who came to visit her at home. Currently, Angela has a hairdressing business. She learned this line of work at a technical school and later decided to open her independent business.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is taking out is to increase her working capital (to buy combs, hairdryers, etc.) which she will acquire at fairs in the city of El Alto and later set up in her place of business. This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her household as far as possible, since she is single and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she liked about Pro Mujer, she replied that she liked the medical consultations, the savings, the training, and the loans.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of a woman also appears in the photo of the group. She is wearing a black jacket.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1365061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy combs, hair dryers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-06-06T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-06T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":29292.92,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3716.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3632.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3674.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3653.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3653.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3653.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3653.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3653.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":539.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":527.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":530.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":530.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":530.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":530.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":530.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568169,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora M\u00f3nica tiene 21 a\u00f1os es casada tiene un hijo de la edad de 5 a\u00f1os, ella se dedica  a la venta de variedad de refrescos tiene su puesto de venta que se encuentra en la zona de plan 3000,  La se\u00f1ora M\u00f3nica es una persona muy trabajadora  que con dedicaci\u00f3n poco a poco va adquiriendo estabilidad y solvencia y tambi\u00e9n popularidad por que es muy conocida por sus clientes ya que La se\u00f1ora M\u00f3nica les atiende muy amablemente,  con el dinero del cr\u00e9dito comprara un frizer para mantener sus refrescos fr\u00edos, la cliente cuenta que con mucho esfuerzo se puede crecer m\u00e1s y as\u00ed seguir haci\u00e9ndose de patrimonio para el bienestar de su familia y tambi\u00e9n personal se siente feliz y agradecida con la instituci\u00f3n por el apoyo brindado.","en":"Monica is 21 years old, married and has a five-year old son. \r\n\r\nShe works selling a variety of soft drinks.

They are working with one of the organization's regional offices in Villa Exaltaci\u00f3n. The group is made up of eight members and is headed by a Board of Directors. Luisa is the President of the Board. The members of the communal bank run a variety of businesses, including clothing sales, trouser sales, a grocery store, sales of powdered dyes, cosmetics sales, sales of sundry items, and wood carving.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit small micro-businesses where Luisa is a member. She says that this is her eighth loan cycle with Pro Mujer. She joined the group at the invitation of a consultant from the institution, who came to visit her at her home. Currently, Luisa has a business running a neighbourhood convenience store. She began this business when she saw what was needed in her area.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is taking out is to increase her stock (to buy rice, sugar, oil, etc.) which she will acquire at fairs in the city of El Alto and later set up in her place of business. This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her household as best as she can, since she is single and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she liked about Pro Mujer, she replied that she liked the training and the loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":1365070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

is 30 years old, married, and lives in Gbarnga, in Liberia. Gbarnga is located in the centre of Liberia, in Bong County. The majority of people are employed as farmers, cultivating crops such as rice, palm oil and cassava.\r\n \r\nFanta has had a sales table for some time, and she sells palm oil.  She works at her business 8 hours each day.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is having too few goods on hand (in stock).  With the proceeds from the loan, she wants to buy more palm oil to sell.\r\n\r\nShe went to school and finished grade 12.  Her husband is a teacher.  She has a nine-year-old child at home, who is in school.  Fanta describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  She is proud of her business, because she earns money every day, for her expenses.  Fanta wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

is 50 years old, single, and lives in Nimba County, in Liberia.  Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore.  The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.  As a result, many people on business pass through the area, bringing lots of trade.  It is also the second most populous area in Liberia.\r\n \r\nAmeamata has had a shop for some time, where she sells clothes.  She works at her business nine hours per day.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is having too few goods in her shop.  With the proceeds from the loan, she wants to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\nShe went to school and finished grade 12.  Her fiancee is a wood seller.  She has a 27-year-old child.  Ameamata describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  She is proud of her business, because she earns money every day, for her expenses.  She wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

is 34 years old, single, and lives in Nimba County, in Liberia.  Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore.  The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.  As a result, many people on business pass through the area, bringing lots of trade.  It is also the second most populous area in Liberia.\r\n \r\nPrecelia has had a shop for some time past, where she sells rubber dishes such as plates, cups, and bowls.  She works at her business 10 hours per day.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is having too few goods in her shop.  With the proceeds from the loan, she wants to buy more inventory.\r\n\r\nShe went to school and finished grade 12.  Her fiancee is a wood seller.  She has six children, aged between 6 and 17 years.  She describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  Precelia is proud of her business, because she earns money every day, for her expenses.  She wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

is 38 years old, married, and lives in Nimba County in Liberia.  Nimba is one of the most resource rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore. The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivorie and Guinea.  As a result, many people on business pass through the area bringing lots of trade. It is also the second more populous area in Liberia. \r\n\r\nShe has had a table business for the past five years and sells fish. She works at her business 10 hours a day. She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is not enough goods in her shop. She went to school and finished grade 12. Her husband is a wood seller. She has four children between 14 and 2 years old.  \r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from the loan she wants to buy more inventory.  She describes herself as a hard-working woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  She is proud of her business because she gets money every day for her expenses.\r\n\r\nShe wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

Enkhtuya, 55 years old, lives with her husband and stepdaughter in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family currently resides in an apartment because they are repairing and insulating their house in preparation for the next harsh winter. \r\n\r\nEnkhtuya has been working as a cook at a restaurant since 2009. Her second husband is a machinist at a private business entity. Her ex-husband lives in the countryside and raises livestock while their son studies at a university. \r\n\r\nHer son, who excels in academics, is participating in a cultural exchange (study-abroad) program in Germany.

Martin was intrigued due to the fact that he was spending $400 a month in rental fees for delivery trucks to move customers.  He received approval for an Accion loan and proceeded to purchase a box truck to offset the monthly rental costs of a moving truck.  Other portions of the loan were used to pay for his full-time employee and continue to offer competitive wages to retain his employee.  Martin says, \u201cI would be stuck in the same cycle, having to rent a moving truck and barely make money from each job.\u201d  He plans to hire four additional full-time employees when business picks up and there is a demand. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about Martin\u2019s company on his website, www.prestigiousmovers.com."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1366352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a delivery truck and pay his employee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Houston, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-06-07T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-07T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":569023,"name":"Laura","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Laura is a 34-year-old married woman and a mother of five children from CPG, Bohol.

The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. He has been rendering taxi service to local people since 2005 and has accumulated a vast amount of experience in picking up customers, driving them quickly and shortening routes. His wife has been working as a saleswoman for seven years and is quite experienced at her job. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and it needs some serious repair. So Boldbaatar is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass and foam.

Their older son lives and works in the Russian Federation. Every month if possible, he sends money home to his parents. Since Odil had financial difficulties in his youth, he was not able to go to university and get an education. Now he can only engage in raising cattle. But this business has saved his family and provides a very good profit. Additionally, Odil moonlights as a security guard. He tries to do everything so that his children lack for nothing.

45 years old, operates a table market selling goods such as pepper, bitter ball, okra, etc in the Paynesville South area of Liberia.  It is a suburb of the capital city of Monrovia and one of the most populated areas in Montserrado County.  The area boasts one of the best standards of living in the county with affordable rents, good roads, access to water and lots of transportation options. She is a married with six children between 22 and 16 years old, who are living at home with her. Only three are currently attending school. The last grade she finished before getting to business is second grade. For the past 10 years, she has been selling pepper, bitter ball, okra, etc in the local market. She started this business with money given to her by her husband and she enjoys her business because the business gives her more money.  She sells six days a week, from 7 am to 6 pm, and most of the time she uses a shared taxi to get her goods to her shop. She is requesting a loan to purchase more inventories for her business. Her plan is to build a house and educate her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":265.89,"image":{"id":1366700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has a fighting and enterprising spirit. She went to primary school up to the third grade, but she was not able to finish because her parents did not have enough economic resources. Her parents have been farmers all of their lives. They taught her how to work the land and grow coffee since she was very young. She has grown coffee with her partner now for six years, because this area of work is the only source of income for her parents and also at the moment for her family. The land she and her partner cultivate is their own, having inherited it from their parents. Their land is located 1.5 kilometers from the house where they live.\r\n\r\nDominga is requesting a loan to buy different types of fertilizer for her coffee crops.

she has received no prior formal education, Abenaa is an entrepreneur. She specializes in preparing and selling \u2018Kenkey\u2019 (a traditional Ghanaian dish made from corn dough and wrapped in banana leaves). She usually sells her \u2018Kenkey\u2019 in Effutuakwa (near Cape Coast). She has been involved in preparing and selling \u2018Kenkey\u2019 for 6 years. \r\n\r\nAbenaa is married and has 2 children. Her husband works as a farmer. The proceeds from her business normally go towards helping her husband cover the family\u2019s general expenses and paying their children\u2019s school fees.

He was married, but has been divorced from his wife for a long time. Uktam has two children that stayed to live with him after the divorce. Since then, he has had to raise and care for his children on his own. He loves them very much and does everything  so that they live in dignity. \r\n\r\nTo earn a living, he operates his own business. Because he lives in the countryside, he is mostly involved in animal husbandry. Uktam raises cattle and sells them in the market, and also sells milk from his cattle.
