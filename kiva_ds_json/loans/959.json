For daily decent food for her children, she grows paddy rice and vegetables. She has had experience in this business for 12 years and is able to earn about 11,000 KHR per day. Her key challenge is the low production where the flood occurs. For this cycle, Sor is a second-time borrower with Kiva's partner, VisionFund. The original loan, which she has paid back completely, has helped her to sustain her business gradually and better support her household. Therefore, she was able to manage to buy a decent motorbike for commuting and shipping her vegetables. Now, she wants to expand her business. Hence, she formed a group of three female members to seek a microloan. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy fertilizer for her paddy field and vegetable garden. She hopes to double her income and therefore attain good progress on her living

She knows that her work is the only income for the family, so she must get ahead despite any adversity.

To sustain her household, Sambath grows paddy rice and raises pigs while her husband helps with the rice farm and provides his threshing service for a fee. Sambath can earn about 20,000 KHR per day from the current business which she has been with for 12 years.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth microloan with VisionFund (Kiva's partner). The past loan, which she has paid back, has gradually provided support to her business with a decent income. For this cycle, she is seeking 1,400,000 KHR while her co-member is seeking 1,000,000 KHR.

Her husband, Felix, is a farmer.  The couple have 6 children, two of whom--Freddy, 37, and Carlos, 19--live with them.  The rest are independent of their parents.  The family live in a house that they own.  Florinda operates a platanos sales business.  She has a food stall in front of her house and meets her customers there.  Most of her customers are local people.  They say that she is friendly and considerate and that she is respected as a valued resident of the neighborhood.  Florinda has operated the business for 4 years.  Her children help her with the business, buying merchandise and tending to customers.  She says that the business is profitable and that she likes being her own boss and contributing to the family's expenses.  She worked taking care of other people's children before and says that she quit when she decided that she was too old enough to go on.  Now she wants to start a clothing sales business.  She plans to buy used clothing from markets in other towns and resell them locally.  This is Florinda's 8th MFP loan.  She says that she is grateful to lenders for supporting her business and helping her work to meet her goals.  She is committed, she says, to repaying the loan on time.  Florinda will use this 500 new soles loan to buy used clothing for her clothing sales business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1199484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy used clothing that she will resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-02T15:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-01T15:50:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":76.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":79.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":85.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":88.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.23,"local_amount":155.58,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":161.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447611,"comment":null},{"amount":31.7,"local_amount":79.24,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":82.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053509,"comment":null},{"amount":34.19,"local_amount":85.47,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188447,"comment":null},{"amount":35.46,"local_amount":88.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":92.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572366,"comment":null},{"amount":36.42,"local_amount":91.05,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":94.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122029,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-02T18:48:29Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":476466,"name":"Thoeurn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"One of the breadwinners in a family consisting of five children, two of whom are students and the remaining three of whom are paid workers in Thailand, Theourn is 42-year-old farmer.

He wants to better provide for his family and says that they are the reason that he works hard.  The bar isn't his only business.  He also has a broom-making business and, if that and the bar weren't enough, a carwash that he operates next to the bar.  He sold used merchandise before and saved enough to start the first of his string of businesses.  He has grown bit by bit, always with the goal of making a better life for his family.  He likes being his own boss, he says, even though it's been difficult at times.  Competition from other similar businesses has led him to wonder if he could go on, but he always perservered, carried on by the love and support of his family.  This is Fortin's 3rd MFP loan and he says that he is grateful for your support.  He wants to thank the staff of the bank and the other members of his community bank, as well, for their support.  Fortin will use this 1500 new soles loan to stock his bar with beer and soft drinks.  He also wants to buy a hose and detergents for his carwash business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1199497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to stock his catering business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-02T16:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-01T16:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":186.93,"local_amount":467.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":486.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447612,"comment":null},{"amount":95.22,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":247.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053510,"comment":null},{"amount":102.69,"local_amount":256.73,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":267.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188448,"comment":null},{"amount":106.52,"local_amount":266.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":277.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572367,"comment":null},{"amount":108.64,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":282.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122030,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T19:29:11Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":476474,"name":"Loun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loun is 43 years old, widowed, and has two children who attend school.

He and his wife, Rubi, 30, have four children: Xiomara, 12; Inda, 5; Joel, 4; and Jeremy, 7 months.  They live with Gerson's parents, in rooms that have been carved out for their own use.  Gerson operates a carpentry business.  He is good with his hands and can turn any piece of wood into a work of art.  He also builds houses.  He developed his skills over several years, working for a master builder who always insisted on doing every job the right way.  He worked with the builder for 4 years, picking up the skills that he knew he would need to support his family.  Gerson also sells ice and soft drinks and helps his wife with her retail business.  They stock the retail business with staple products that they buy from markets in other towns and resell locally.  He likes what he does, he says, because the jobs and buildings that he works on are, in part, the results of his creative bent.  He makes a good living, as well.

She enjoys her work very much and feels good being able to divide her time between her household chores, her children and her business.

She\u2019 single and the mother of two children she cares for with much dedication; she focuses all her efforts on them to get ahead and improve their daily living conditions.

She has an inherited refrigerator she was able to buy with much effort.  She used to use it just to store what she used for her weekly meals but the need to earn income led her to use it for her economic activity and now it helps her earn income.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in business 10 years and fortunately does well since she earns good daily profits.  She works alone because she doesn\u2019t need help to do this work.  However, she also sells food and her mother does help her with this activity and her children help her take care of customers, wash utensils, and collect payment.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been selling outside her house for the last 8 years and always sells out everything she prepares daily for sale.  She\u2019s doing very well because having two activities generates double household income and this allows her to provide better living conditions for her family.  What she likes best about her work is chatting with the customers because this makes the long work day more pleasant.  Later on she plans to build a larger locale to provide better customer service.\r\n\r\nThis is her second MFP loan and she\u2019s very excited and grateful for the economic backup she\u2019s being offered to continue with her plans.  She doesn\u2019t want to miss paying for it for lack of money which is why she commits to be very punctual and above all very responsible.  She\u2019s very happy to continue in this group because they are very responsible and kind.  She will use the requested 1,000 soles to buy ingredients to continue with her food business and will also buy soft-drinks and gelatin treats to continue selling at home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1199615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients, soft-drinks and gelatin snacks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-02T19:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-01T19:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":159.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":158.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":171.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":177.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":181.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.54,"local_amount":311.34,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":324.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447620,"comment":null},{"amount":63.42,"local_amount":158.57,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":165.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053518,"comment":null},{"amount":68.42,"local_amount":171.03,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":178.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188456,"comment":null},{"amount":70.96,"local_amount":177.41,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":184.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572375,"comment":null},{"amount":72.66,"local_amount":181.65,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":189.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122038,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-08T02:59:01Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":475060,"name":"Martiza Marlene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Maritza Marlene habitante de Col, San Miguel, desde su peque\u00f1ez se ha dedicado al trabajo del campo, realizando actividades agricolas y pecuarias, las cuales se convierten en su principal  fuente de trabajo y las que le generan  ingreso economico, trabaja en conjunto con su compa\u00f1ero de vida y dos hijos mayores en su unidad de produccion, requiere de este financiamiento para invertirlo en establecimiento de 1.5 Mzs del cultivo de Yuca, actividad que realizara con un buen manejo tecnico, esperando incrementar la produccion de dicho cultivo y fortalecer su economia, referencias la consideran como una persona  trabajadora, responsable y de buenas culturas.","en":"Mrs. Maritza Marlene lives in the Colonia San Miguel.

Najma has been in the business of clothes trading for many years. Being the primary breadwinner of her family, she is a diligent worker. Her husband works as a taxi driver and pays rent for a car. He alone is unable to provide for their four children, so Najma contributes a lot to the family income through her business. Every day early in the morning, she picks up her bag of sample clothes and visits various marketplaces. She shows sample pieces of clothes to shopkeepers who then order the desired quantity. Currently, she is in her second loan cycle. Previous records show that Najma is a responsible client who makes timely payments. \r\n\r\nShe requested a loan of Rs 30,000.

Since it is the major source of his income, he aims to improve and strengthen the business so that he will increase his income and satisfy his family's needs. He plans to raise more pigs to sell in the future, but he doesn't have enough capital. Therefore, he is asking for an additional PHP 20,000 to buy feed, vaccines, vitamins and materials needed to improve his pigpen. He is hoping that someday he will improve the business and make it viable in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1203517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed, vaccines, vitamins and materials to improve the pigpen","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

She's separated from the father of her three children. Her children are the main reason for her to keep on working and therefore be able to improve their living conditions. They live together in a house that she owns and was able to purchase with hard work and a lot of sacrifice. Julia's business is selling food such as breakfast in the mornings and meals in the afternoons, etc. Every morning she opens her stall, which she rents in the central market, and there she offers all her prepared food and also refreshments. She tends to her customers very kindly. They're mostly her own seller neighbors, who recommend her to other people that eventually become her regular customers.\r\nShe got her start over 20 years ago with a private loan. She used to buy and sell in small quantities and then she gradually expanded the business according to the demand for her food. To this day she does the work on her own.\r\nShe considers her business to be very profitable because of the earnings she gets from it, and because she almost always sells everything she prepares.\r\nFurthermore, she reports that she enjoys her business, because she's skilled at cooking. She decided to start the business due to the need for an income and a trade of her own, because the child support wasn't enough for her children and she faced financial hardships. Now, as she sees good results, she wishes to keep her business going. This is her second loan with MFP. She's very glad to know that she has financial support, because that way she feels secure to move forward with her business. On her part, she pledges to make her repayments in a timely manner, as she has in her previous loans. Besides, she's very glad to be a member of her communal bank, since everyone is very responsible and supportive. With the requested amount of 1,500 nuevos soles she will purchase ingredients and supplies for making food and selling it at her stall. She'll get better prices for her purchases, and therefore she'll stay in business and increase her profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1200546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients and supplies for making food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-03T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-02T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":170.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":176.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":184.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":190.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":197.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":208.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":214.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.19},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.49},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":130.85,"local_amount":327.13,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":340.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447631,"comment":null},{"amount":70.41,"local_amount":176.01,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":183.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053529,"comment":null},{"amount":73.94,"local_amount":184.86,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":192.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188467,"comment":null},{"amount":76.29,"local_amount":190.72,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":198.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572386,"comment":null},{"amount":162.68,"local_amount":406.71,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":423.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576806,"comment":null},{"amount":85.83,"local_amount":214.57,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-26T09:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":223.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530629,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-19T23:32:30Z","paid_date":"2013-06-26T09:01:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479603,"name":"La Fidelite 2 (#2) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Serge is 45, single, and has 3 children ages 6 to 18.

Because of this, Erasmo works very hard to get ahead with his family and with all of the household expenses.  He has been able to note that if he gives a lot of effort, in the end he has his reward.  With his work he has been able to make many projects in his house, and with his family, a reality.

But, as there is no public transportation he has to pay for a carrier that moves it or, on the contrary, he has to move on his back from the store to his house and this produces extra wear.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested to buy fertilizers, poisons and insecticides to be able to apply them to his corn and bean plants on time, to have an excellent harvest.\r\n \r\nThe first necessity that will be satisfied is that he will be able to buy all of the inputs together and thus obtain a better price, have savings in the sale, and the application to the plants will be just in the time that they need them.\r\n\r\nHis life will improve greatly, since upon buying all of the inputs and applying them on time to his plants, the production will be very good and when it's time to sell them more income will be generated.\r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to be able to carry out his dream to have a prosperous and abundant harvest, having faith in God, and with the help of the loan to be able to buy the inputs that he needs to apply them to his plants.

She is a hardworking and earnest woman- and additionally very cheerful and sociable- who greatly hopes to progress. She lives with her 12 year old nephew who she loves very much.  She is living comfortably in her own house. Dora works selling basic grocery items. To do this, she relies on a small store set up in her own house, from which she very graciously serves her customers. She started it more than 10 years ago with her own capital, seeing the necessity of having an income to count on. She does this work of customer service alone.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because of the excellent earnings that it provides her.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her business because it allows her to be in the comfort of her home taking care of her daughter, as well as having free time that she can spend on other activities just as much as the economic revenue generated, which she uses for her household expenses. On the other hand, what she doesn\u2019t like is that some of her customers request credit for their purchases, which she refuses, as she has already had bad experiences with this type of purchase. Because of this, all of her sales are in cash, and she can see her earnings faster. \r\n\r\nShe has plans to expand her business more, and therefore continue growing and generating more economic revenue. This is her second loan with the MFP organization; because of it she hopes for their collaboration so that she will be able to fulfill her plans. Therefore, she is committed to complying with the payment of her installments.  \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 1000 nuevos soles, she will invest it in the purchase of wholesale groceries, in order to have a greater margin of earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1200660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She feels very happy to be working because it makes her feel useful to society though she has often felt like stopping because of the tiredness she experiences as a result of her age.  However, she always finds new energy and continues working with a lot of optimism.  She hopes to improve her sales business for the well-being of her family.  \r\n\r\nThis is Flora's 3rd loan from MFP.  She is grateful to the people who will give her the loan she needs to increase her working capital and pledges to make her loan repayments on time.  She is happy to belong to her community bank because the members are very supportive and responsible.  Flora will invest her 1,000 soles loan in buying more sweet treats such as candies, cornflakes, gum, etc.  She will also renew the utensils that she uses in selling her soft drinks such as plastic jugs and buckets."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1201331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy candies, cornflakes and gum, plastic jugs and buckets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-03T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-02T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":159.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":165.12},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":174.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":183.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.86,"local_amount":152.15,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":158.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447648,"comment":null},{"amount":63.68,"local_amount":159.19,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":165.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053546,"comment":null},{"amount":66.04,"local_amount":165.12,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":171.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188484,"comment":null},{"amount":66.52,"local_amount":166.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":172.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572403,"comment":null},{"amount":69.64,"local_amount":174.08,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":180.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122065,"comment":null},{"amount":73.26,"local_amount":183.16,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":190.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867890,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She lives with Marcos who is employed and the father of their four children who she loves very much and is her reason to continue working.  They live comfortably in their own house.  Flor\u2019s activity is selling different brands of carbonated beverages in various flavors.  She chills them according to her customers\u2019 wishes.  To do so, she has a refrigerator she bought with a loan and installed at home.  She kindly and cordially tends to them from there knowing that with this kind of treatment she will win over her customers\u2019 loyalty.\r\n\r\nShe started more than 6 years ago with a private loan that helped her make her initial purchases.  When she saw the good way her business was welcomed she reinvested her profits to buy larger quantities and to date continues doing it with help from her partner.\r\n\r\nShe considers the business to be quite profitable because of the profits it nets and because beverages are constantly being consumed due to the hot weather in the zone.\r\n\r\nShe comments that prior to starting her business she had no problems but she did want to have an occupation to keep her busy as well as to earn her own income and help her spouse with expenses and not be completely dependent on him.\r\n\r\nTherefore, seeing the good results she\u2019s having, she plans to stay in business and increase her merchandise to make it grow.  This is her second MFP loan.  She is grateful for this new financing opportunity because she\u2019ll feel more confident that she\u2019ll advance with her business.  On the other hand, she comments that she likes the work in her communal bank that supports people with a line of credit to make their plans reality.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 900 new soles to buy furnishings like tables, chairs and others for her locale seeking the lowest prices for volume purchases so her profits will be higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1201307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy tables and chairs for her customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-03T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-02T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":142.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":141.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":153.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":160.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.25,"local_amount":278.35,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":281.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447645,"comment":null},{"amount":54.96,"local_amount":141.32,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":142.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053543,"comment":null},{"amount":59.57,"local_amount":153.18,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":154.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188481,"comment":null},{"amount":62.54,"local_amount":160.84,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":162.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572400,"comment":null},{"amount":64.68,"local_amount":166.31,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":167.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122062,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

He is a hard worker, dynamic and friendly.  She is living with Zen\u00f3n, who is the father of her five children ages 15, 13, 9, 7 and 4.  She lives with them in her own house, which she obtained years ago through effort and hard work.  \r\n\r\nLuc\u00eda makes a living selling groceries.  She has a small store set up in her home where she sells basic products that are known for their quality and low prices.  Among the items that she offers are rice, eggs, bread, milk, cooking oil and some sausages.  She started this business about eight years ago and it is doing well thanks to the good clientele that she has built over the years.  For the most part, she requires cash only, but she sometimes offers credit to those whom she trusts.  She sometimes gets help from her partner, who helps her with cutomers and with the transport of merchandise, which she brings in weekly.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her job is that she generates her own income, which allows her to pay for household necessities and helps her partner with the distribution and management of basic expenses.  What she doesn't like is that she has to attend to the business all day, which has caused her to give up family gatherings and outings.  However, she now always finds the necessary time to be with her family and has learned to balance her business with her home life.  \r\n\r\nThis is loan number 4 with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support that offers her the guarantee that she can continue working without worries.
