She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their three children.\r\n\r\nSanta is excited to be taking her 4th loan with Esperanza International, after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business, where she sells chicken, pork, beef and meat sausages. She will use the profits to buy a battery for her power generator and to save to buy her own house. She said that her most difficult challenge is to travel, as she would like to visit other countries like Hawaii.  This is one of her most cherished dream as she wants to meet other cultures. Her future plans are to have her own house, to have a successful and sustainable business, and then to travel to different countries.\r\n\r\nShe started doing her business almost three years ago with some money she saved, and she is taking Esperanza\u00b4s loan because they are comfortable to do business with. She thanks you all for your support.

To provide a source of income for her family, Jumabubu became involved in animal husbandry in 1997.  The business, started with 10,000 som (KGS), today yields about 12,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and meat products.  Thanks to Jumabubu's hard work, her livestock headcount includes five dairy cows and thirty-five sheep.  In order to further develop her business, Jumabubu requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings into a further increase of livestock headcount in order to open her own mini-farm in the future.

","en":"Julia is 53 years old and lives in the city of Barranquilla, where she makes a living selling goods through customer orders. She is married and has a 22 year old son who she hopes will become a successful person. \r\n\r\nThree years ago she saved enough from the stand that her son supplies and started her own business adventure because she needed to feel productive and to financially support her home. This was how she began to purchase bed quilts and towels which she initially sold on credit to friends and relatives. \r\n\r\nJulia has done very well with her business but she hopes for it to grow. The biggest challenge to expanding her business is having enough capital for purchasing and broadening her customer base.

This group is located in the city of El Seybo, one of the most agricultural and rural cities in the Dominican Republic. The borrowers run their businesses in the communities near the city. They sell clothes, shoes, grocery store items and others.\r\n\r\nMargarita makes her home here in a simple house with her long-term partner and four children. She is a devoted mother. She is running a clothing store where she sells all kinds of men's, kid's and women's clothes. She will use this loan to increase her inventory by buying more clothes, specially for the summer season.

her husband and son in the city of Kamenka. She grows early vegetables in greenhouses for sale at city markets. Irina owns a large plot of land and has been farming for three years. She has three big greenhouses and also two greenhouses for seedlings. Her farm is worth 150,000 griven now and she spends 27,000 griven yearly to purchase seeds and plastic foil.\r\n\r\nIrina is planning to use the loan from Kiva to install a heating system in her greenhouses. She needs 12,000 griven so that she can buy the necessary pumps, tubing and holders. Recently Irina used 18,000 griven to purchase a water heater and now she needs this loan to purchase the rest of the supplies and install the heating systems in her greenhouses as she has been planning to do for a long time. This year Irina has invested all of her money into this project but in the future she is hoping to use some of the profits to repair her family home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1043654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Desde el a\u00f1o 1994 cuando regres\u00f3 de prestar el servicio militar, trabaj\u00f3 con su padre en un peque\u00f1o taller de reparaci\u00f3n de tel\u00e9fonos.

De regres\u00f3 a Barranquilla, con mucha mas experiencia y un alto potencial de clientes, decidi\u00f3 ubicar un local,  en un punto estrat\u00e9gico del lugar donde vivia,  e inici\u00f3 nuevamente su oficio y se dio a conocer. Hoy se dedica al mantenimiento, la reparaci\u00f3n de electrodom\u00e9sticos y a la compra y venta de ellos, tiene su negocio en un espacio ubicado en un local en  casa de su suegra, donde habita con su familia y genera otros ingresos con la venta de queso, capital de trabajo que tambi\u00e9n produjo su negocio, del cual hoy se siente orgulloso, pues le ha posibilitado adquirir mucho de lo necesario, para su bienestar y el de su familia.

He has always been very creative, and this led him to think of his current job, which today generates the income to house and take care of his family.  In 1994, when he returned from military service, he worked with his father in a small television repair workshop.  In observing the market there, he became aware of the need to repair and maintain other electrical appliances.  Thus four years later, he decided to start his own business.  With little knowledge but with the support of more experienced friends, he organized his workshop bit by bit, acquiring experience and an ability to take risks, and it has paid off: he found clients in other cities, such as Cartagena, where he did very good work for four years and polished his technical skills.  Returning to Barranquilla, with much more experience and a high chance of getting clients, he decided to set up business, in a strategic point in the family home.  Today, he maintains electrical appliances and buys and sells them.  His store is in his mother-in-law's house, where he lives with his family, and he generates additional income by selling cheese, purchased with the working capital produced by his business.  He is very proud of all this, as it has made it possible for him to acquire much of what he needs to look after his own and his family's welfare.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying to Kiva for the second loan he has received from microfinance partner the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  He will use the money to buy a batch of televisions that have been offered to him at a good price so he can repair and resell them.  This will generate a much higher profit margin, so this investment has to succeed.  With his first loan from the Foundation, he bought tools, such as a Fluker tester, which is indispensable for the service he provides, since it is very precise.  His future goal is to buy an oscilloscope, a soldering station, enhanced lighting, and a shop window, to take advantage of the fact that in the place where he is located, there are no other repair shops.  But his biggest challenge is that before he can realize these future plans, he needs to get together enough working capital as quickly as possible.  Still, he knows that little by little, he can achieve his dreams and finally have his own house for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1032899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a batch of televisions to repair and resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Corregimiento la Playa-Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82685},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84615},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86589},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88609},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90677},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92793},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94958},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97174},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99441},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":101761},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104136},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":106562}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.56,"local_amount":82685,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83718.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141097,"comment":null},{"amount":48.67,"local_amount":84615,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":85673.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100978,"comment":null},{"amount":221.51,"local_amount":385080,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":389895.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130206,"comment":null},{"amount":332.26,"local_amount":577620,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T08:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":584842.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527997,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-22T23:15:26Z","paid_date":"2013-05-19T08:45:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402523,"name":"Martha Consuelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha de 44 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer casada que tiene 3 hijos en las edades de 5 a12 a\u00f1os.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo en el negocio, es que ante la demanda permanente, su capital de trabajo resulta insuficiente para responder a ella y all\u00ed   radica el \u00e9xito de esta inversi\u00f3n. ","en":"44-year-old Martha is a married woman with three children who are between 5 and 12 years old.   She makes income through her daily work in a store that she owns where she sells snacks, food products and soft drinks.  She started her business as a way of making additional income to put together with that made by her husband who works as a taxi driver in order to provide for their family's well-being.  In addition, she wanted a job that would allow her to be at home close by her children while they are at an age when she needs to educate them and care for them, especially one of them who is disabled.\r\n\r\nMartha started out in her business selling soft drinks but gradually, using her savings, she stocked it with a variety of other goods.  Every day she has new customers and she needs to keep her store stocked with a variety of products that she sometimes does not have.  This is why she is applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use the money to buy oils, pasta, grains and other products that her customers buy every day and which experience a very quick turnover.  As a result of this investment, she will be able to maintain her stock levels and respond effectively to her customers.  The biggest challenge she faces in her business is not having enough working capital to meet her permanent demand.  This is why her investment will be successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1032902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy oils, pasta, grains and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":58538},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59904},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":61302},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62732},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64196},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":65694},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":67227},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":68796},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":70401},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":72043},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":73724},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75443}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.76,"local_amount":58538,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":61179.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651481,"comment":null},{"amount":35.56,"local_amount":59904,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":62606.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141098,"comment":null},{"amount":36.4,"local_amount":61302,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":64067.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100979,"comment":null},{"amount":37.25,"local_amount":62732,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":65562.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338601,"comment":null},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":64196,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":67092.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395167,"comment":null},{"amount":14.56,"local_amount":24516,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":25622.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519097,"comment":null},{"amount":278.35,"local_amount":468812,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":489964.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497187,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T07:40:15Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:33:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403985,"name":"Roliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roliza is 38 years old and married with 4 children, 1 of whom is in school.

is 22 years old and is excited to be expecting her first child. All her life she has lived in Lusaka, but now she runs her own mobile money transfer business in a small town called Kafue.\r\n \r\nTamara first got started working as a money transfer teller in her brother-in-law\u2019s shop when she was 19 years old. She worked there for over two years and got to know everything there is to know about the business. She then underwent an intense training period and in September 2011, she was given her own shop to run in Kafue. \r\n\r\nThis was only the beginning. She has grown into a full-blown business woman who goes above and beyond to make sure her customers are happy. Her customers benefit from her business because there is no need to open an account. She is also located right in the heart of Kafue so customers do not have to go far to do their money transfers. \r\n\r\nHer biggest business concern is that she is not able to give her customers the fastest possible service because she has problems accessing the internet due to the poor signal at her shop. She also worries about sometimes having to  ask her customers to wait, as she rushes to the bank and back, to get money to serve them. \r\n \r\nTamara is sure that a loan from Kiva will change her business because it will give her the money she needs to buy a computer and increase her working capital.\r\n\r\nHer hope is for her business to start making more profit by the time she has her baby. \r\n\r\nIn her video, Tamara is being interviewed by a representative from Mobile Transactions.

Ella inici\u00f3 su negocio  de vender  productos fritos, como arepas, empanadas, chorizos, papas rellenas, chuzo y chinchurria,  desde el a\u00f1o 2011; su principal clientela la conforman vecinos y visitantes del sector, que le compran de contado todos los d\u00edas, pues trabaja de lunes a jueves desde las 4 de la tarde hasta las 10 de la noche  y de viernes a domingo, desde las 4 hasta las 12 de la noche.  En este sector aunque la competencia es alta,  todos se conocen y compiten, mientras ella se sostiene con precios justos, amabilidad y calidad en sus productos.

She started her business selling fried snacks like arepas [stuffed, grilled corn cakes], turnovers, sausages, stuffed potatoes, brochettes and fried tripe since 2011.  Her main clientele is formed by neighbors and visitors to the sector who buy and pay cash daily because she works Monday through Thursday from 4 in the afternoon until 10 at night and Fridays through Sundays from 4 until midnight.  Competition is high in this sector.  Everyone knows each other and competes but she stays in business with fair prices, kindness and the quality of her products.  Her greatest challenge is attaining business growth because she lacks working capital for her projections and more staff to reach her dreams.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a Kiva loan at present, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she will use to buy raw materials like oil, dough, salt, meat and cheese at higher volume to meet ever expanding demand.  While Diana works to reach her dreams she has 1.35% liquidity and a profit margin on sales of no less than 44%, financial indicators from which we predict growth for her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1032946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy oil, dough, salt, meat and cheese in greater volume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":52938},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":59774},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":61168},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":62596},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":64056},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":65551},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67080},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":68645},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":70247},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":71886},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":73564},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82495}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.43,"local_amount":52938,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":55326.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651486,"comment":null},{"amount":443.57,"local_amount":747062,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":780768.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993838,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-26T15:49:59Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402537,"name":"Jair Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jair  de 26 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al sur de la ciudad y tiene un negocio mediante el cual ofrece servicios de internet, fotocopiado y llamadas.

challenge.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1032962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to

Today with his loans he\u2019s attained better living conditions and he dreams with making his business grow much more taking advantage of the fact that he lives in a very commercial sector with much growth potential.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the third financing he\u2019s gotten from the Fundaci\u00f3n that he will use to buy materials to make new shoe designs.

tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, \u00e9l es casado y tiene dos hijos en las edades de 16 y 32 a\u00f1os. \u00c9l se dedica a la venta de mercanc\u00eda que promociona mediante gu\u00edas especializadas de productos; su actividad inici\u00f3 desde hace 11 a\u00f1os, cuando trabajando como vigilante, decidi\u00f3 alternar su trabajo con una actividad que simult\u00e1neamente generara ingresos suficientes, para el sostenimiento de su familia. Fue as\u00ed como en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposa durante 5 a\u00f1os fabricaban  chicha,  logando una venta diaria de 300 bolsas, las cuales repart\u00edan entre tiendas y a particulares ubicados en su sector, pero por complejidad del transporte diario del producto, que deb\u00edan trasladarlo desde la ciudad de Barranquilla hasta la Urbanizaci\u00f3n la Playa, decidieron no seguir y dedicarse a tener una vivienda propia. Fue as\u00ed como se instalaron en un terreno donde poco a poco construyeron la vivienda que hoy poseen, inicialmente fue de madera, pero poco a poco lograron construirla en cemento y dejaron un espacio locativo decidido con el prop\u00f3sito de tener una tienda. All\u00ed vend\u00edan art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar por un tiempo de 3 a\u00f1os, pero la proliferaci\u00f3n de este tipo de negocios en el sector, los oblig\u00f3 a cambiar de actividad por una helader\u00eda y donde tambi\u00e9n estuvieron 3 a\u00f1os m\u00e1s, pues el hurto continuo del cableado el\u00e9ctrico,  casi los dej\u00f3 descapitalizados, teniendo que arrendar el local, con el fin de generar ingresos mas seguros. Rafael y su esposa decidieron entonces, vender mercanc\u00edas en general y vincularse con proveedores que le suministran cat\u00e1logos para promocionar los productos. Rafael tambi\u00e9n tiene 14 a\u00f1os de trabajar como vigilante de un edificio y maneja su propia clientela. Siempre apoyado por su esposa, ha logrado sacar adelante a sus hijos. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, sexto cr\u00e9dito que recibe de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n a la que est\u00e1 vinculado, hace 8 a\u00f1os y de su mano ha logrado hacer crecer su negocio y mejorar sus condiciones habitacionales. Con su credikiva planea continuar mejorando su vivienda y levantar paredes, pues tiene problemas de humedad que afectan a su vecino, as\u00ed mismo terminar\u00e1 de construir una de sus habitaciones en la parte trasera de la vivienda,  para lograr el acomodamiento de toda su familia en su hogar y mayor sosiego. ","en":"52 year old Rafael is married and has 2 children who are 16 and 32 years old. He works selling goods that he promotes through special catalogs. He began doing this 11 years ago when he was working as a guard. He decided to combine his job with other work that would also generate income in order to support his family. In this way, along with his wife, he spent 5 years making chichi (a sort of fermented drink), and reached daily sales of 300 bags which they delivered to stores and people in the neighborhood. But, because of transport complications for their product, which they had to move from the city of Barranquilla to the La Playa urban area, they didn't continue and decided to focus on having their own home.  So, they got some land where, little by little, they built the house that the own today. At first they built it of wood, but, little by little, they were able to build parts from cement and they left a space empty with the idea of having a store there.  They sold family groceries there for 3 years but the proliferation of these sorts of businesses in the neighborhood obliged them to change their store to an ice cream place, which they then ran for 3 more years. However, the continuous theft of electrical wiring almost left them broke and they had to lease the store space so that they could have a more secure income. Then Rafael and his wife decided to sell general supplies and to link themselves to companies that use catalogs to promote their products. \r\nRafael also has 14 years of work experience as a guard and has his own clients. Always supported by his wife, he has been able to bring up his children. At this time, he is applying for a Kiva loan and this will be the 6th loan he has received through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization he has been associated with for 8 years and which has helped him to grow his business and improve his living conditions. With his Kiva loan, he plans to continue improving his home and building walls. He has damp problems that are affecting his neighbor and also will finish building one of the rooms in the back part of the house so that there is space for all the family and greater peace. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1033183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to build walls as he has a problem with damp, and to build a room in the back part of his house.

He used to work for a company that produced and sold shoes, but he retired from this position in 1985 so that he could start up his own venture.  He bought shoe lasts (molds) and a motor, with which he began making sandals that he would sell to his relatives and friends. Very soon people began to take note of the quality of his products.  He would display each design in his own home, and he started to sell by the dozens to customers who had their own clientele, and so in this way he has continued to work.  His dream is to have more growth in his workshop, so that he could hire workers and generate jobs.  In addition, he would like to have his own place where he could exclusively display his shoes.  However, his main challenge is that he lacks the working capital he needs to achieve his dreams and be able to respond to his rapidly growing customer base.  At this time, he is applying for a Kiva loan, and this will be the first time that he has had financing through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With this loan, he will buy glue, leather, heels, platforms and plastic, and he will also make some repairs to his shoe stitching machine.  He expects that this investment will be successful for two reasons.  First, with the loan he will have more working capital and so will be able to buy in cash and in greater volume, so that he will be able to get discounts. Second, he brings a lot of technical experience to the project, acquired when he was an employee of a company that makes one of the best quality brands of shoes in Colombia."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1029745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy glue, leather, heels, platforms and plastic, and he will also make some repairs to his shoe stitching machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hector","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":109759},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":112320},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":114941},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":117623},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":120367},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":123176},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":126050},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":128991},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":132001},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":135081},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":138233},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":141458}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.55,"local_amount":222079,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":228027.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141104,"comment":null},{"amount":67.05,"local_amount":114941,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":118019.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338607,"comment":null},{"amount":678.4,"local_amount":1162980,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1194128.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519103,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T18:02:31Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402627,"name":"Yadira Jamileth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yadira Yamileth de 41 a\u00f1os de edad es soltera, sus hijos est\u00e1n estudiando, uno la universidad y el menor terminando la primaria; labora para la municipalidad como inspector ambiental desde hace 3 a\u00f1os.

She is a entrepreneur at the market, where she sells a most diverse assortment of goods:  children's jackets, windbreakers, men's and women's hats, as well as backpacks and camping gear.  Natalya has already been selling hats for quite some time; she started 15 years ago.  However, by training, Natalya is a guide.  Four times a year, she leads various groups on hiking trips.  When the time came, her skills and the experience she earned as a guide helped her to open a sales outlet for camping gear, which she added to her assortment of clothes and hats.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, Natalya has 40,000 hryven invested in inventory.

She will use her loan to buy 50 lengths of wax pagne. She restocks at the S\u00e9gou grand market and sometimes in Bamako. She sells her goods on credit and her customers are mainly women. She hopes to make 80 000 CFA francs on average per month, which will be reinvested in her business, and used to buy household supplies and healthcare items for the children. Kadiatou's ambition for her partnership with Soro Yiriwaso is to buy a plot for housing.

With the help of his wife, they purchased their first cattle.\r\n\r\nXudakarim usually buys small calves and raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, then resells them for a more profitable price in the livestock bazaar. His monthly income is 230 AZN and this business is the only source of financial income in his family. \r\n\r\nBeef is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes, such as pilau and dolma. Xudakarim also keeps milking cows for personal use and for selling to neighbors.  \r\n\r\nHe wants to expand his business and improve the living conditions of his family. He applied for a 1500 AZN loan to purchase two calves, one milking cow and fodder.
