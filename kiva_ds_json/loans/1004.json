The additional profits will enable her to better meet her family's needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1245669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

is Marilou, 37, a resident of Payatas, Manila, Philippines. She is married to Onofreg and mother to her children. Together with her husband, Marilou manages her household while operating a variety store. She works hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5-PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Marilou buys supplies at wholesale prices and sells by the piece. Her regular customers are neighbors and local community members and she earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nMarilou is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory and help continue her business.

46, is married with nine children. Six of the children are currently attending school. He is a small-scale farmer from Kitale county in western Kenya, where he has been farming for fifteen years now. His mixed farm produces maize, vegetables and sugarcane, all of which are sold in the local market. He solely depends on the income from farming to cater to the needs of his family. However, he faces the challenge of diseases that are too expensive to treat and a poor transport network that affects his income.\r\n\r\nDavid has made a loan request of 62,400 KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow. This loan will enable him acquire a quality dairy cow that will produce enough milk for domestic consumption and sale. The proceeds from the sale of milk will enable him improve the livelihood of his family. He hopes that in the near future he will have expanded his farm to five acres and acquired six dairy

The cheese is sold at the local open market. \r\n\r\nBesides dairy farming, Besik serves the local people as a taxi driver with his own car. His wife is involved in a flower-trading business. She purchases flowers locally and sells them in the nearby district for a higher price. \r\n\r\nAll of the family members work hard, but the income is not enough for covering the everyday expenses. So, Besik decided to start up a new business. He has requested loans from his local financial institutions several times without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.\r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country, rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Besik will build a greenhouse. He will purchase building materials and construct it. Besik will plant different kinds of flowers, which will be sold by his wife at a good price. This will increase his income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is 36 years old, married and lives in Batumi city with her husband and two children (12 and 15 years old). The children go to the local school and her husband is an armament officer who earns a monthly salary. Madona\u2019s economic activity is a newly started small grocery store. She also rents out a room in her house to earn additional monthly income. Madona requested a loan from local financial institutions for the business expansion, but without success. Her loan request was rejected because of low income and insufficient experience in her business.\r\nHer loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The program provides start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor. They do not have access to traditional credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nMadona requested a loan to equip the store with an additional refrigerator. She will keep perishable products there and will be able to sell meat which is in high demand. The existing refrigerators are inadequate to store all the inventory.

tiempo y ha sido una situaci\u00f3n muy dif\u00edcil para ella, pero decidi\u00f3 seguir llevando a cabo su vida con m\u00e1s empe\u00f1o y fuerza de voluntad Vive en el cant\u00f3n Pastaza ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta ciudad. La competencia entre microempresarios es muy grande, sin embargo cada uno ha puesto su valor agregado para ganar preferencia con los clientes. \nRosa tras su separaci\u00f3n, se encontraba insegura sobre su futuro, all\u00ed en Pastaza, sola sinti\u00f3 que no hab\u00eda alternativa para ella por su avanzada edad. Sin embargo las limitaciones duraron poco cuando puso en pr\u00e1ctica los conocimientos impartidos por sus padres en emprendimiento y comercio de especias para los alimentos. Desde que sale el sol, Rosa abre las puertas de su negocio ubicado en un peque\u00f1o espacio del mercado del pueblo, el cual comenz\u00f3 desde hace 10 a\u00f1os con la ayuda y apoyo de su hija. Rosa se ha convertido en una mujer emprendedora y piensa que siempre se puede alcanzar m\u00e1s y que nunca es tarde para so\u00f1ar. Con 10 horas al d\u00eda que invierte en esta actividad se ha dado cuenta que su negocio puede crecer de alguna forma. Es por eso que se decidi\u00f3 a solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar especias y hierbas para incrementar sus ventas. Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa otorg\u00f3 este cr\u00e9dito y adem\u00e1s ha ofrecido a Rosa la capacitaci\u00f3n y asesor\u00eda necesarias para administrar de forma correcta sus recursos tangibles e intangibles. Rosa agradece a los prestamistas de Kiva por aportar su granito de arena al cumplimiento de su sue\u00f1o de ser una microempresaria exitosa. ","en":"Rosa, 57, went to elementary school, and then married young. She recently separated from her husband, which has been a very difficult situation for her, but she decided to keep moving forward with more determination and strength of will. She lives in the canton of Pastaza, in the provine of the same name, which is part of the Amazonian region of Ecuador. The capital of the canton is the city of Puyo, which is located in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, just west of the province of Pastaza at 924 metres above sea level. Demographically it\u2019s a small area, but it has a variety of sites that attract national and international tourists, especially ecological endeavours and extreme sports.\r\nIt\u2019s a city that grows economically every day because of commerce, livestock breeding, agriculture and tourism; for this reason, financial and commercial businesses have opened branches here to take advantage of the economic activity maintining the city. Competition between companies is strong, but each has promoted its own added value to gain preference with clients. \r\nAfter her separation, Rosa found herself insecure about her future; there in Pastaza she felt that she had no alternatives because of her advanced years. However, those limitations didn\u2019t last long when she put into practise the knowledge she gained from her parents, concering the undertaking of a business and selling spices.\r\nAfter the sun comes out, Rosa opens the doors to her business, which is located in a small space in the local market. She started her business 10 years ago with the help and support of her daughter. Rosa has become a determined woman and thinks one can always accomplish more and it\u2019s never too late to dream. With the 10 hours that she invests in her work every day, she knows her business can grow in some way. That\u2019s why she decided to request a loan to buy spices and herbs in order to increase her sales. \u201cFundaci\u00f3n Alternativa\u201d communal bank has offered Rosa the training and advice to correctly administrate her tangible and intangible resources. Rosa is grateful to the Kiva lenders for contributing their grain of sand to the accomplishment of her dream of being a successful small business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1245895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"buy spices and ingredients to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pastaza","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa  Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":626.88,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":75.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":76.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.74,"local_amount":73.05,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":75.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126217,"comment":null},{"amount":78.39,"local_amount":75.6,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":78.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516823,"comment":null},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":76.71,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":79.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068679,"comment":null},{"amount":81.29,"local_amount":78.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":81.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494945,"comment":null},{"amount":81.9,"local_amount":78.98,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":81.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524874,"comment":null},{"amount":83.21,"local_amount":80.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133178,"comment":null},{"amount":84.3,"local_amount":81.31,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313722,"comment":null},{"amount":85.63,"local_amount":82.58,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565327,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T21:19:25Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502199,"name":"Adama","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Adama est une femme mari\u00e9e qui vit au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

is 23 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has two children, one of whom is currently in school. For the past two years, Cissy has been working hard to manage her small business selling vegetables. \r\nTo help expand her business, Cissy has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more vegetables, such as green cabbage, for resale, and it will help Cissy to generate greater profits and add in the business to expand. Cissy hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\nCissy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is 49 years old and lives with his wife and two children (15 and 18 years old) in Zestaponi district.

He has been running the business during five years and the project was profitable, but now it needs financial support. Several times, he has asked for loans from local financial institutions to develop his business with no success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of his low income.\r\nJansughi\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit, with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Jansughi will cover the costs of purchasing needed stock of books that customers often request. He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Jansughi will work hard, and he will be able to improve the living conditions for his family. With this loan, the family will generate enough income to access regular available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event it is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1245807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase books for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Zestaponi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jansughi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":82.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":96.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":101.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":107.12},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":110.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":119.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.15,"local_amount":82.15,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":82.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565944,"comment":null},{"amount":96.46,"local_amount":96.46,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115517,"comment":null},{"amount":101.85,"local_amount":101.85,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":101.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860997,"comment":null},{"amount":101.68,"local_amount":101.68,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569801,"comment":null},{"amount":105.13,"local_amount":105.13,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":105.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968439,"comment":null},{"amount":107.12,"local_amount":107.12,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":107.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748862,"comment":null},{"amount":110.54,"local_amount":110.54,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":110.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612776,"comment":null},{"amount":595.07,"local_amount":595.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":595.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856520,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-03T00:27:31Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T14:44:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502233,"name":"Comfort","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Comfort is a petty trader.

The need to support her son created this opportunity and she has been able to become a great cacao producer in her area.\r\n\r\nShe can always count on external personnel or helpers for her normal activities, since her parcel of land is large and requires outside help.\r\n\r\nShe likes her job very much because she considers the work in the fields the healthiest there is, even though cultivating the plants takes a lot of time and effort.  Despite that, she considers her production to be very profitable because she is located in a zone where the cacao is of a unique quality.\r\n\r\nShe wants to begin the cacao campaign in a different way.  She plans to replace the old trees and use the leftover stems to graft, so she needs to buy new plants, fertilizer, tools and hire trained people in order to get an optimal result and get the maximum benefit from her parcels.

wants a Fresh Life Toilet for several reasons. He manages a primary school in Mukuru and needs a toilet for the school pupils. Additionally, he wishes to provide sanitation services to families living in close proximity to the school. This way, the Fresh Life Toilet, a sanitation system that collects waste cleanly and converts it into high-value byproducts, will benefit both the school and the local community.\r\n\r\nThe school Douglas currently runs is in Riara, a sub area of the Kwa Njenga informal settlements of Nairobi. The school has both a kindergarten section and a primary section.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Douglas foresees a community that is clean, safe and healthy, where the local community is empowered and able to make lifelong positive community impacts in the informal settlements."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1245283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Waste Management","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase and run one Fresh Life Toilet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mukuru (Nairobi)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":258,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Douglas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.61,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2031.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339619163,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4063.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347350605,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T08:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3047.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364979135,"comment":null},{"amount":318.75,"local_amount":27000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-19T09:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":27428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373380462,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-28T21:05:47Z","paid_date":"2013-06-19T09:05:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502236,"name":"Esi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esi sells beads and jewelry at Ankwanda near Elmina. \r\n\r\nEsi has been through senior high school.

The one thing that completes her happiness is her little Antony, 13. Together they form a family where love and work are their reasons for being.\r\n\r\nThanks to all their years of work and effort they have managed to finish building a home made from good quality materials. She farms the parcels of land that she and Manuel have acquired. For 20 years they have been managing to establish cacao plantings, which over time have achieved an enviable quality.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time she has had various life experiences, both good and bad, but always at the side of her partner. He in turn is her faithful work companion, not to forget the day laborers that she hires to help with the necessary work.\r\n\r\nIn beginning next year's cacao season, she has carried out the reconditioning of a part of her land to render it more productive, and ready for the planting of the seedlings or young cacao, for which she must acquire these plants and also buy sacks of organic fertilizer. \r\n\r\nAnother of the her requirements for optimizing her output is to bring in day laborers for the planting of temporary shade trees which are very necessary so that the sun doesn't directly affect the plantings.\r\n\r\nThis is how she carries on with quite a bit of motivation, since one of her long-term objectives is to acquire a home in the region's capital. This is so that  in the future she can send her son to a fine university for his post-secondary studies \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP. She is very happy and promises to be punctual in making her installment payments. She sees her fellow communal bank members as a good team; responsible and supportive, and this makes her feel very confident.\r\n\r\nWith the 1000 nuevos soles she has been granted, she will buy cacao seedlings, as well as sacks of organic fertilizer.

It makes a total of 150 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit George will rent space and start an auto repair business. George plans to purchase essential auto repair installations such as a tire changer and trim controller in order to respond rapidly to his clients' problems. He believes that acting properly is really essential to attracting more customers. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Both lead a harmonious coexistence and have, as the fruit of their love, their son Edwin, who is 6 years old. She has managed and worked together with her partner in their carpentry business for the last four years. The business started because the young couple was looking for a fixed income to support the family, because then Edwin was only working as a helper in other workshops. They decided later to become independent thanks to loans from MFP and their savings thereafter. \r\n\r\nThey consider their work an activity of family union. Rosmeri helps with the minor activities in the pair while Edwin is in charge of the main, required work. Working together in this way they have succeeded in converting their business in to their primary family income. However, sometimes delays in the arrival of their wooden blocks causes them to have to cancel certain orders. \r\n\r\nIn order to continue completing orders, they wish to continue investing in the purchase of blocks of wood for the fabrication of tables, chairs, beds, and more.

muy dif\u00edcil educar sola a su hijo, pero \u00e9l se ha convertido en la inspiraci\u00f3n de cada d\u00eda para salir adelante en su trabajo. Viven en Pastaza, un cant\u00f3n ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta ciudad. En cada negocio se encuentra personas que no se han dado por vencidas frente a la falta de empleo sino que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio para llevar una vida digna y hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os.\nMaricela emprendi\u00f3 con la venta de frutas y verduras de forma ambulante cuando qued\u00f3 embarazada, es decir hace alrededor de 4 a\u00f1os. La posibilidad de continuar estudiando se hab\u00eda desvanecido, primero por los escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos y despu\u00e9s por la llegada de su hijo. Sin embargo a pesar de los obst\u00e1culos ha salido adelante con su vida. Trabaja diez horas cada d\u00eda, su trabajo consiste en clasificar, limpiar y vender las frutas y verduras que ofrece, en sus salidas se ubica en lugares estrat\u00e9gicos de barrios en donde las amas de casa realizan sus compras. Aprendi\u00f3 este negocio de sus padres y ahora lo administra muy  bien. En esta temporada aparecen en el mercado frutas tropicales como ciruela y mango que son muy demandadas por los clientes. Es por eso que Maricela requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para abastecer su negocio con una cantidad de estas frutas y as\u00ed recaudar m\u00e1s ingresos para ofrecer a su hijo un estilo de vida digno y adem\u00e1s mantener un ahorro que en el futuro pueda invertirlo en la educaci\u00f3n de su hijo y as\u00ed poder darle la profesi\u00f3n que ella no tuvo la oportunidad de conseguir. Maricela agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes con agilidad y confianza le otorgaron el cr\u00e9dito y adem\u00e1s la asesor\u00eda para llevar una buena administraci\u00f3n y presentaci\u00f3n de su negocio. ","en":"Maricela is a 20-year-old young woman.  She finished secondary school.  She's single and has a child, age 3.  It has been very hard for her to raise her child alone, but he has become an inspiration every day for her to get ahead in her job.\r\n\r\nThey live in Pastaza, a canton located in the province of the same name, in the Amazon region of the Republic of Ecuador.  The canton seat is the city of Puyo, located in the middle of the Amazon jungle in the west of Pastaza Province at 924 meters above sea level.  Demographically it's small, but there's a wide variety of sites preferred by Ecuadorian and international tourists, especially for ecological and extreme sports activities.\r\n\r\nIt's a city that grows economically every day because of commerce, livestock, agriculture, and tourism.  For this reason branches of banks and businesses have been established to make the most of the economic activity here.  In every business there are people who, faced with the lack of jobs, have not given up but rather have undertaken ideas for businesses to have a decent life and make their dreams come true.\r\n\r\nMaricela started selling fruits and vegetables on foot when she was pregnant, about four years ago.  The possibility of continuing to study had disappeared, first because of her scarce financial resources and then because of the arrival of her child.  Nevertheless, in spite of the obstacles, she has gotten ahead with her life.  She works ten hours every day.  Her job consists of sorting, cleaning, and selling fruits and vegetables.  When she goes out to sell she stays in strategic locations in neighborhoods where housewives shop.  She learned this business from her parents and now manages it very well.  \r\n\r\nIn this season, tropical fruits such as plums and mangos appear in the market and are in high demand among her customers.  This is why Maricela needs a loan to stock her business with a quantity of these fruits and earn more income to give her son decent lifestyle.  She  also wants to maintain savings she can use in the future for her son's education, to give him a profession, which she herself didn't have the opportunity to have.\r\n\r\nMaricela is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, which adroitly and trustingly gave her the loan and the counseling to manage and carry out her business well.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1245913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to

Rosalind is grateful for the help Kiva investors offer those of few resources -- and poor countries like Nicaragua -- so that they can have a dignified work environment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":953524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"invest in business capital and stock her business with flip-flops for men, children and women, and shoes made of fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalina Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.21,"local_amount":1251.93,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1278.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331972513,"comment":null},{"amount":53.08,"local_amount":1248.91,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1275.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339564199,"comment":null},{"amount":53.22,"local_amount":1252.21,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-21T08:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1279.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347758071,"comment":null},{"amount":56.84,"local_amount":1337.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1366.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356526917,"comment":null},{"amount":53.43,"local_amount":1257.29,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364568127,"comment":null},{"amount":53.45,"local_amount":1257.65,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373162748,"comment":null},{"amount":53.39,"local_amount":1256.17,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1283.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381968543,"comment":null},{"amount":48.38,"local_amount":1138.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1162.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390830356,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-09T22:13:50Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:28:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502297,"name":"Abdul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdul is a Ghanaian artisan who makes hand-carved wood masks and sculptures.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I always knew I wanted to paint but wasn't sure I could make a living out of it, so I looked into other fields too. I observed master carver Musa at his workshop for a period of time, then I picked up a log of wood and started carving out a mask as I had observed him doing. This surprised Musa, and he was willing to help me perfect the skill. I developed a love for this new art, and that's how I eventually became a master carver too! I am now able to share this skill with others who I teach to carve.\"  \r\n\r\n\"Thanks to the first micro-credit you granted me, I was able to bring in other wood carvers to assist me. Now, I'd like to stock up on materials to continue creating my masks.

She says that because they had no jobs, she and her husband set up their business.  \r\n\r\nAt first they sold paint for shoes, shoe polish and shoe laces and then the people themselves suggested they start to stock things like screwdrivers, screws and many other things so she says she saved up a little money and went to Mexico City to stock up because all sorts of hardware and things sold in hardware stores are sold there; she decided to make her business grow and says that she\u2019s now asking Vision Fund for a loan to improve her stand.  She wants to make it grow by buying some packages of hardware she saw and she wants to buy a tarpaulin because the one they have is deteriorated because of the weather.

vacuno y bovino.

She\u2019s 44-year-old and a widow.  She\u2019s a member of the \u201cLos Encinos Ganader\u00eda\u201d group.  She says they gave it this name because where they live oak trees are common and the \u2018ganader\u00eda\u2019 part is because most of the members work raising pigs, cattle and sheep.  She says that at her husband\u2019s death, she\u2019s had to take on her children\u2019s care all by herself.  Back then, the three of them were students but now two of her daughters work in Mexico City as domestic employees and they help her support her son who is attending high-school with much sacrifice.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been growing avocadoes for more than four years.  She says: \u201cMy husband left me a business that requires much hard work to care for but thanks to it I\u2019m able to move my son, who is studying, forward since I was unable to study due to the lack of resources.  I have to devote myself to the land my late husband left me and thanks to the three loans I\u2019ve gotten I\u2019ve been able to move it forward even though I did neglect it somewhat when my husband died but now it\u2019s in good condition.\u201d  She says she\u2019s asking for this loan to buy organic manure, fertilizer and insecticide to protect against the chilling frosts and hail storms that are common in winter.  \r\n\r\nShe says that she now has about 200 trees and hopes to continue planting more since her field is large; it\u2019s almost two hectares and she wants to cover it entirely with this type of fruit.  She relates that when it\u2019s harvest time she heads to the wholesale food market to sell them by the kilo since it\u2019s more profitable to sell them that way.  She says the last few harvests have been good since her yields were quite large.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest hope is that her youngest son will have a career so he will not have to suffer working in the fields and that her daughters can restart their schooling because she does not like their being so far from her.  She also wants to continue to buy avocado plants to continue growing them and leave a good business for her children.\r\n\r\nThe other group members\u2019 names are Eulalia, Mar\u00eda del Carmen, Mar\u00eda Luisa, Mar\u00eda, Alicia, Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica, Lorena, Rosario and Sandra and they will use their loans to buy fertilizer, organic manure for avocado farming, will buy feed and vaccines for pigs, fertilizer and manure for tomato crops and will buy merchandise to stock a grocery store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5375,"image":{"id":1236873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Ella es parte del grupo Invierno y dice que le pusieron ese nombre al grupo porque cuando tiene m\u00e1s actividad econ\u00f3mica su pueblo es en la temporada de invierno ya que donde vive se encuentra el santuario de la mariposa monarca donde a\u00f1o con a\u00f1o arriban las grandiosas mariposas para dar un espect\u00e1culo sin igual y donde miles de turistas de todo el mundo van a admirar las bellezas de la naturaleza. Dice que a ella le llena de orgullo ser parte de un pueblo como este ya que se conoce gente de todo el mundo y pueden ver los turistas las artesan\u00edas que hacen los pueblos ind\u00edgenas de Michoac\u00e1n. Dice que casi todo el a\u00f1o ella se dedica a bordar servilletas, manteles, almohadones con lo representativo de su pueblo, es decir, las mariposas monarca y que las vende en poblaciones aleda\u00f1as a su comunidad y que ahorita est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de material porque a partir del 20 de noviembre de cada a\u00f1o se abre el santuario y empiezan a llegar los turistas y quiere surtir para vender afuera del santuario  como playeras, recuerdos como llaveros, lapiceros, cuadros de madera con fotograf\u00edas de las mariposas ya que tiene su puesto desde hace mas de 14 a\u00f1os.

Comenta que cuando termina la temporada de mariposa que es a mediados de marzo es cuando empieza a vender en su tiendita de abarrotes que tiene en su casa. Su meta en su negocio es tratar de conseguir un puesto estable en el santuario para que cada a\u00f1o pueda vender sus artesan\u00edas y no tenga que pagar tanto impuesto que le cobran por poner su puesto de artesan\u00edas y recuerdos de la mariposa.

She says that she spends most of the year embroidering napkins, tablecloths and cushions with scenes representative of her town, that is, monarch butterflies that she sells in towns adjacent to her community.  She\u2019s now asking for a loan to buy supplies because starting on November 20th each year the sanctuary opens and tourists start arriving and she wants to be stocked up to sell outside the sanctuary.  She sells t-shirts, keepsakes like key rings, pencils, wood picture frames with photos of the butterflies, etc.  She\u2019s had her stand for more than 14 years.\r\n\r\nShe has three children and is married to Daniel who works as a day laborer.  She comments that when the butterfly season ends in mid-March she works selling in her little, home-based grocery store.  Her business goal is to try to get a stationary stand in the sanctuary so that she can sell her crafts each year and not have to pay the high taxes she\u2019s charged to set up her crafts and butterfly keepsake stand.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Teresa, Imelda, Rosa and Adela.  They will invest the loans they are granted into buying ingredients to make rustic bread, to buy grocery store stock merchandise and to buy ingredients to make Mexican fast-food snacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":1241440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy crafts and embroidery supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-29T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-29T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":3550,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":519.46,"local_amount":6731,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6776.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068163,"comment":null},{"amount":257.65,"local_amount":3338.62,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3360.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284901,"comment":null},{"amount":543.55,"local_amount":7043.24,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":7090.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199188,"comment":null},{"amount":288.06,"local_amount":3732.62,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3757.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595985,"comment":null},{"amount":462.1,"local_amount":5987.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6027.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663427,"comment":null},{"amount":205.78,"local_amount":2666.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2684.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840210,"comment":null},{"amount":1273.4,"local_amount":16500.28,"processed_date":"2013-08-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":16610.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698721,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-30T23:42:54Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:46:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502378,"name":"Aves De Para\u00edso Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Florencio tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad y es originario de una comunidad llamada Valle Verde un lugar lleno de vegetaci\u00f3n y donde la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes se dedica al comercio, platica don Florencio que tiene menos de un a\u00f1o trabajando con VisionFund y que le ha ido muy bien en su negocio a trav\u00e9s de los cr\u00e9ditos que le han hecho y eso lo tiene muy contento porque puede sacar adelante a su familia.

Florencio has worked with VisionFund for less than a year and the loans have helped his business go very well, so he is very content because he can make headway for his family. He belongs to a group called \"Aves de Para\u00edso\" (\"Birds of Paradise\"), which gave itself this name because their meeting place has a thicket of flowers of the same name that aren't very common in the region and are very beautiful. Florencio makes a living making ice creams and sorbets, with flavors like strawberry, coconut, vanilla, lemon, chocolate, apple, cheese, and many others, but these are the ones most requested by his customers, who are mostly children and youths since he sells outside of a elementary and high school in his community. He says that he is requesting the loan to purchase supplies to make his sorbets, such as milk, food dyes, fruits, ice, rock salt, sugar, cones and napkins. He says that he gets up very early to make his sorbets because they need to be ready by the time the children leave school. First he grounds the fruit or adds vanilla to the milk. The trick is with the ice cream. He says that he puts ice and rock salt inside a big pot so it doesn't melt too quickly, and then he puts another metal canister inside with the ingredients and slowly churns it as the ice cream freezes. He says he does this every day so he can take his delicious and rich ice creams to the school. He says that he started this job because he could not find stable work and a friend told him how to make ice cream, so he decided to take up the work. He says, \"I enjoy what I do because I already have my customers, and I'm my own boss and have time to be with my family.\" He has four children who are in elementary and high school, and for this reason he works very hard to provide them with the best and so they don't lack anything in regards to their education.

Mar\u00eda educa a su  nieto que tiene 13 a\u00f1os debido a algunos problemas que la madre del chico tiene con su horario de trabajo. Viven en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad. Cada familia de este lugar se esfuerza y busca todas las alternativas para mejorar su calidad de vida, por lo que se puede hablar de un cant\u00f3n emprendedor.\nMar\u00eda estableci\u00f3 su taller de costura desde hace algunos a\u00f1os, aprendi\u00f3 con la experiencia y poco a poco fue mejorando, ahora es toda una experta e invierte entre 8 y 10 horas en la elaboraci\u00f3n de ropa para toda ocasi\u00f3n, seg\u00fan la demanda de sus clientes.

Mar\u00eda se ha unido con amigos que tambi\u00e9n tienen necesidad de engrandecer sus negocios como es el caso de Jofre quien se dedica a la crianza y venta de cerdos, como lo hace Julio quien aparte de cerdos, vende pescado, y a esta actividad tambi\u00e9n se dedica Cruz quien comercializa cerdos y pollos Mar\u00eda quien cria pollos para su posterior venta, Teresa, Mar\u00eda y Ver\u00f3nica quienes venden ropa por cat\u00e1logo, al igual que Sonia quien a pesar de una discapacidad f\u00edsica tambi\u00e9n vende bisuter\u00eda de forma ambulante, Patricio y Angela cada uno con su tienda de v\u00edveres. ","en":"Mar\u00eda is 62 years old. She grew up in a poor family, so she only managed to get through elementary school. She separated from her husband a number of years ago, which was something very painful in her life and represented an obstacle in pursuing her business. Mar\u00eda raises her 13-year-old grandson because of some problems the boy's mother has with her work schedule. They live in Quinind\u00e9, a hamlet in the province of Esmeraldas that provides a number of cities in Ecuador with bananas, cacao, coffee, palm and forest products, and the majority of the inhabitants make a living in commerce. That has become even more the case since the roads into town were expanded, allowing a lot of commercial movement, especially on the weekends when merchants of all kinds go out to offer their products at the area flea markets. Tourism is another important industry because the natural ecosystem offers a wide variety of places to see waterfalls, rivers and forests full of flowers and animals. Every family works hard and looks for new ways to improve their quality of life, so one could call this an enterprising place. Mar\u00eda started her seamstress shop a number of years ago. She learned from experience and little by little improved her craft, and now she is an expert and spends between eight and 10 hours a day making clothing for all occasions, according to the demands of her customers. She is requesting the loan to purchase distinct fabrics and in this way she can offer a wider variety of styles. She hopes this will increase her income, since her goal is to have a big seamstress shop making clothes to sell all over the country, and with that she will be able to pay for her grandson's education until he becomes a professional. Mar\u00eda has joined with friends who also need to expand their businesses, as is the case with Jofre, who makes a living raising and selling pigs. Juilo raises pigs and sells fish, while Cruz sells pigs and chickens. Another Mar\u00eda raises and sells chickens. Teresa, Ver\u00f3nica and another Mar\u00eda sell clothing via catalog, same as Sonia, who despite a physical disability also sells jewelry.

Jos\u00e9 has been doing this type of work for 35 years and now he has the help of his son, who works as his assistant and is also practicing the trade at an institute.  He says that his business is profitable because he only had to make an initial investment \u2013 the purchase of the necessary tools for repairing vehicles.  Prior to pursuing this profession full-time, Jos\u00e9 thought he would start a business of buying and selling timber.  However, he did not know anything about this trade, so he ended up getting swindled and losing all of his capital.  After that, he made the decision to return to his previous skillset of repairing vehicles since that is what he knows best.  In addition, he would have the opportunity to work at home and be with his family.  He hopes to improve his shop in the future by acquiring a lathe and a grinder.  \r\n<p>\r\nJos\u00e9 is requesting a loan of 2,500 PEN so that he can buy spare parts such as spark plugs, chains, bearings, and other items.

It is hardly enough income for food for a four-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \r\n\r\nTengiz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Tengiz will purchase a minibus. After purchasing a minibus, Tengiz plans to go to the capital city with his minibus and sell milk, yogurt and cheese there.

Olivia is 22 years old and lives in the town of Hima in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past two years, Olivia has been working hard to manage her retail shop, in which she sells flour, sugar, soap, and cooking oil.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Olivia has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more commodities like soda, sugar, Splash brand juice, and cooking oil for resale. This will help Olivia to generate greater profits and pay for her medical bills and her child. Olivia hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. She makes sure that she works hard to see that she educates her child.\r\n\r\nOlivia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Prudence is 23 years old and lives in the town of Kamwenge in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is married and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Prudence has been working hard to manage her small business selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prudence has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes to resell and will help Prudence to generate greater profits and pay for her medical bills and her children. Prudence hopes that, in the future, she will be able to educate her children up to the university level and also buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nPrudence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past 2 years, Christine has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fast foods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Christine has requested a loan of 400000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more cassava, Irish potatoes and cooking oil that will be fried for resale, and will help Christine to generate greater profits and expand the business. Christine hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business into a big hotel. \r\n\r\nChristine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Both of family members get monthly salaries. Besides, Margalita\u2019s father-in-law is provided with a retirement pension. \r\n\r\nMargalita has requested loan from local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of lack of experience in new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers.\r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, Margalita will start up a dental clinic locally. She will purchase dental equipment and operative supplies to satisfy the professional needs of the dentists that will be working at her clinic. Margalita hopes her business will be profitable because of the price range and well qualified dentists. This will increase her income and the family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs, in order to improve their living

is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. For the past year, Jamiila has been working hard to manage her small food stall, which sells raw food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jamiila has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food such as matooke (steamed green bananas) and sweet potatoes for resale. It will help Jamiila to generate greater profits and take care of herself and buy basic needs for the family. Jamiila hopes that in the future she will be able to own a bigger business than what she has now. \r\n\r\nJamiila is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past two years, Allen has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells all types of flour, sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Allen has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Allen to generate greater profits, which will be used to buy food at home. Allen hopes that in the future she will be able to earn more, which will help take care of her family. \r\n\r\nAllen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

is 18 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. For the past three years, Nadia has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells all types of flour, sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Nadia has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap. This will help Nadia to generate greater profits and expand her business into a bigger shop and to buy more items for the shop, which will increase her capital. Nadia hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nNadia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1246260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

is 22 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past year, Hadijja has been working hard to manage her small food stall, which sells fruits. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hadijja has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fruits like tomatoes and will help Hadijja to generate greater profits and buy basic needs at home like food. Hadijja hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business into a bigger food stall. \r\n\r\nHadijja is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Irene is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. For the past four years, Irene has been working hard to manage her small restaurant business, which sells cooked food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Irene has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food that will be cooked for resale. This will help Irene to generate greater profits and increase her capital to buy needed items for the restaurant. Irene hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own. \r\n\r\nIrene is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She will use the 1,000 new soles to buy barnyard fowl chicks and also set aside some of the money to buy grains of corn for the constant feeding of the fowl.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1245959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-29T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-29T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":110.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":112.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":126.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":136.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":140.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":110.46,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188957,"comment":null},{"amount":44.9,"local_amount":112.23,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":116.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572854,"comment":null},{"amount":48.07,"local_amount":120.18,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":124.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122513,"comment":null},{"amount":49.02,"local_amount":122.56,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":126.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868337,"comment":null},{"amount":50.76,"local_amount":126.89,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":131.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577164,"comment":null},{"amount":52.35,"local_amount":130.88,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":135.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529409,"comment":null},{"amount":54.53,"local_amount":136.32,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":141.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974528,"comment":null},{"amount":56.19,"local_amount":140.48,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":145.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995949,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-29T20:30:56Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502354,"name":"Reyna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reyna, de 42 a\u00f1os, es una mujer cordial y emprendedora.

En la actualidad su clientela ha crecido y requiere una mayor infraestructura, esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 un molino de caf\u00e9 dos mesas, sillas y necesita reacondicionar su kiosco. \u00c9l est\u00e1 muy satisfecho, pues todos los procesos lo hacen directamente y con caf\u00e9 org\u00e1nico, que muelen ellos mismos, pues es apoyado por su esposa tambi\u00e9n. Sus compras las realiza directamente a los agricultores ubicados en los Montes de Maria, \u00e1rea de su convergencia y sus ventas las realiza directamente al consumidor, apunt\u00e1ndole a su gran sue\u00f1o futuro, de  tener un punto de venta en M\u00e9xico y tambi\u00e9n uno en Nueva York, pero su gran desaf\u00edo, es crecer lo suficiente porque los recursos financieros puede lograrlos poco a poco y en eso est\u00e1 trabajando gradualmente. ","en":"Neyl is 42 years old and lives in the municipality of San Jacinto where he makes a living selling coffee and coffee products in a kiosk that he has had since 2011. However, he has 11 years of experience in this work when he worked in SENA--National Learning Service, and was able to take advantage of the education provided. He organized business initiatives, selling coffee, milk shakes, iced coffee, and other products derived from coffee. \r\n\r\nHis clientele has now grown and he needs a greater infrastructure, which is why he now needs a Kiva loan, his first loan that he is taking out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan he will buy a coffee grinder, two tables, chairs and will pay for the repairs needed for his kiosk. He is very satisfied because he manages his business directly and uses organic coffee that he grinds himself and with the support of his wife. He buys directly from farmers located in Montes de Mar\u00eda and he sells directly to the consumer. He has a dream to have a kiosk in Mexico and in New York in the future. However, his greatest challenge is to grow enough because he can only obtain the resources little by little. He is working gradually to accomplish this.

He is proud to belong to Vision Fund because it has helped his transport business very much. He is 34 and married to Brenda, who is a high school teacher.

Christopher was born in San Felipe de los Alzati, a beautiful place where a winter season flower called Nochebuena is grown every year. It is also a tourist destination close to the Zirahuato and Santuario de la Mariposa Monarca archeological sites. \r\n\r\nHe has taken classes in electronics, computer technology, carpentry, and cutting and sewing, but none in his current profession. As a youngster, he helped his mother meet the household expenses, since she was a widow and he was responsible for his family from an early age. With their combined efforts, they bought a van that he has used to offer public transport service for 13 years. His route begins in Zit\u00e1cuaro and passes through different towns until it ends in Dongu; he has two other routes as well. \r\n\r\nHe is applying for a loan to do maintenance on the three vans and also to buy spare parts and tires. This loan will let him repair his transport vans and will be of great help in supporting his family and his brothers, who have regular work driving two of the vans. His goal for the business is to save money to buy a new transport van and increase his profits.\r\n\r\nThe four other group members are Tomasa, Irma, Estela G., and Estela M.

At thirty-seven years old, he shares his life with his partner Ruth, who is thirty-three years old.  Together, with their effort and work pushing them forward, they have provided a good education with values and morals to their four children.  He has a home constructed of wood.  \n\nHe has worked as an organic cacao farmer since he was a young boy, since his parents and grandparents were also faithful producers of various crops.  He has been an independent producer for thirty years, thanks to some land he acquired from owners who auctioned it off.\n\nHe feels very proud to be a great producer in this area.  Thanks to the permanent support of Ruth in their different activities, they have managed to avoid hiring day laborers for various tasks.  With all of their experience in the countryside, they are very capable in farming tasks, like planting, weeding, and pruning the cacao trees.  They obtain good profits and make a great team effort that revitalizes them as a couple.\n\nAs part of a plan to replace the old cacao trees, he wishes to bring in plot grafts to take the maximum advantage possible from their crops.  This requires him to count on urgent capital to buy seedling trays, an organic fertilizer made of sea bird dung from the Peruvian Islands, and to purchase the tools needed for the hard work ahead.\n\nIn general, the cacao plantations require a type of shade when they initially begin to grow.  For this reason, he finds himself planting timber trees for shade.  In the future, he hopes to sell them as blocks of wood.  He already thinks this is a good business that he would like to get into.  \n\nHe is requesting 1000 \"soles\" to buy seedling trays to use in grafting process for the cacao plants.

She has worked with VisionFund for four years although before she was part of a group called Barandillas. She decided to leave and ask for an individual loan with which she is very excited since she has faith in that her business will grow because of the new loan. For more than 21 years, she has had a couture shop in her home. She says that it all began because in high school she would go to the cutting and sewing workshop, and when she left high school creating clothing caught her attention. Therefore, she decided to enroll in a special school to perfect her techniques for the production of clothing. She says that she makes blouses, suits, pants, skirts, trousers, sheets, bedspreads, pajamas, etc. In the season in which the children and youths begin school, she goes to the schools to sell uniforms, and sometimes that same school will ask her to make daily and full-dress uniforms. Also, she makes suits for dances, costumes, fifteenth-birthday dresses, wedding dresses, and evening gowns.\r\n\r\nShe says that the loan that she is requesting is to buy material like cloth of different textures and colors, thread, zippers, buttons, needles, and many more things needed to make her clothing. She is very happy because she says that thanks to her new loan her business will improve a lot. Apart from this, she wants to buy a variety of cloths and materials because she wants to make bathroom, living room, and dining room sets, like Christmas table cloths since these are sold at a good price.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she will go to Mexico City and de Toluca where she will buy her material since one of her siblings will take her there to place the orders that afterwards they will bring to her house since she will buy wholesale. \r\n\r\nShe is the single mother of one daughter, and she says that she is making her want very much to come out ahead because she wants to improve her quality of life and to save money for her studies when she is older. She says that her recommendation letter is from the same people who recommend her to others since her products are very pretty and delicately made.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1245988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy material such as cloth of different textures and colors, thread, zippers, buttons, needles, and many more things needed to make her clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-29T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-29T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2729.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2820.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2965.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3226.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3285.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3480.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3635.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3836.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4021.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":211.58,"local_amount":2730,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2744,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068168,"comment":null},{"amount":218.56,"local_amount":2820.09,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2834.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284906,"comment":null},{"amount":229.85,"local_amount":2965.79,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2981,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199193,"comment":null},{"amount":250.27,"local_amount":3229.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3245.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595990,"comment":null},{"amount":254.66,"local_amount":3285.88,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3302.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663429,"comment":null},{"amount":269.75,"local_amount":3480.59,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3498.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840074,"comment":null},{"amount":578.68,"local_amount":7467.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7505.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698415,"comment":null},{"amount":311.65,"local_amount":4021.31,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4041.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944765,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T18:49:37Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T19:05:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502520,"name":"Othman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Othman is a 45-year-old married man.

is 36 years old and lives in the Khobi District with her husband and 3-year-old son.

Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.  The only source of income for the family is the agricultural business, which is a plot of land where maize, laurel leaves, and citrus are grown.  In addition, the family runs a small dairy farm of 3 milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products.  The monthly income of the family is hardly enough to feed three people.  \r\n\r\nAccording to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category.  Maka requested a loan from Credo to start a dairy farm.  Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit due to low income (which labels them as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d).\r\nWith the requested loan, Maka will purchase a car which will be used to take the cheese to nearby villages for sale.  This will significantly decrease their transportation costs and allow additional savings for home renovation.

In the future, Indira plans to raise the economic condition of her family. She is grateful for everyone's support.\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for their meat but are used for their milk. Curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made from dairy cows. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about $0.50 USD. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung used in home construction, as fuel for fires and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

The house is situated in the small village of Guaraguaos Alto in Tambogrande District.  The area where Elsa lives is rural, but she does have electricity.  Elsa's business involves selling beer from her own home, where she prefers to serve her customers on Saturdays and Sundays. \n\nShe has built up a stable customer base in the area and has more than 5 years' experience in the business.  Her husband is a farmer who has his own parcel of land, on which he grows mangoes and lemons.

She is a super mom. Since 1976 she has been working in animal husbandry and providing the main source of income for her family. She started her business with 1,000 som. Thanks to hard work and persistence, she now has a total of three dairy cows, 20 sheep, and 12 horses.

He works as a carpenter while her mother tends to the house and family. Both her parents were only able to complete their primary education before they needed to enter the workforce. This loan will help Silvia to focus on finishing her law degree and become the professional that she aspires to be.\n\nSilvia has two brothers and one sister, but she will be the first student in her family to earn her college degree. She hopes to be an example for her siblings. With multiple college-educated people in the family, Silvia feels hopefully that together her siblings can change her family\u2019s status and provide a comfortable life for each other. She currently earns $350 per year, but she hopes to earn over $6,000 annually after she graduates.

He is currently enrolled in a degree program at the San Fransisco Xavier University but with his currently financial status he is unable to purchase the materials he needs, which is crippling his performance in school. Juan shares with us that without a computer it is difficult to learn and practice the practical component of his degree and it is inconvenient and even challenging to complete his thesis without consistent access to a computer and the internet. Much of engineering is computer based and without one, he feels that he is falling behind. \n\nAlthough Juan is the youngest of two, his household supports eight people in total. While both his parents are college educated, their family finances are very tight. With the aid of a student loan Juan plans to buy a laptop and the books and materials that will help him succeed. He chose commercial engineering because the field interested him and because he perceived a need for it in the job market. He hopes to be able to use his salary to help his family\u2019s finances.\n\nIn addition to his classes and study sessions, Juan holds a part time job. Currently he makes around $8,600 a year but with a degree in engineering he hopes to be able to double his salary, maybe even more. The prospect of a secure salary and in turn, a secure future for himself and his family is worth the sacrifice and extra work now. With the security of loan, Juan can be confident that he can afford his full education and be able to help move his life and his family forward.\n\nThis loan is administered by Vittana's partner Banco

He has customers who always ask for his merchandise, and when he doesn't have something, he doesn't hesitate to go to another place to obtain what his customer is requesting. \r\n\r\nHe has been in this business for 20 years, and everything is going extremely well. He performs these tasks every day, generally in the mornings, from Monday to Friday.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful that things are going very well, as he has good customers who seek him out each day because of the quality of the wood he sells.

Actualmente est\u00e1 divorciada y vive con su hija menor Diana en el sector sur de la Capital de los ecuatorianos; en Quito, espec\u00edficamente en Chillogallo. Hasta hace pocos el sector sur de la ciudad de Quito, no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles. \nSandra desde hace 12 a\u00f1os estableci\u00f3 un negocio de venta de frutas y verduras, uno de los obst\u00e1culos m\u00e1s grandes que ha tenido y que significaron un monto de dinero significativo, fue cuando detectaron a su hija mayor un c\u00e1ncer el cual fue tratado y ahora ella se encuentra estable con su salud. Sandra aprendi\u00f3 esta actividad con su t\u00eda que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 desde muy ni\u00f1a sobre los proveedores, las cuentas, etc. Sandra lo desarroll\u00f3 por sus hermanos para sacarlos adelante y luego por sus hijos. Es un trabajo muy duro pues requiere de esfuerzo f\u00edsico para cargar las cajas de frutas y luego clasificarlas, y aun el horario de trabajo requiere mucha fuerza de voluntad, pues al menos Sandra invierte 12 horas cada d\u00eda, desde que empieza a amanecer a la una de la madrugada, hasta las 13H00 o m\u00e1s. Sandra pide ayuda para obtener un pr\u00e9stamo el cual lo dedicar\u00e1 a comprar al por mayor frutas de temporada que son muy demandadas por los clientes. Los ingresos extra que se generen los invertir\u00e1 en el crecimiento de su negocio y en la educaci\u00f3n superior de su hija menor. Sandra dice que espera dejar huella en sus hijas y que cuando ellas se sientan realmente realizadas est\u00e9n convencidas que su madre cooper\u00f3 para llegar hasta all\u00ed, es por eso que inclusive planea capacitarse en donde aceptaron confiar en ella para prestarle el dinero, en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa una intermediaria de Kiva que capacita y fortalece los negocios de emprendedores con el objetivo de disminuir la pobreza en el pa\u00eds.","en":"Among the challenges all Ecuadoreans face to overcome the threat of poverty day to day is Sandra, a 42-year-old woman with many stories to tell but what\u2019s now of concern is her present and her and her daughters\u2019 future who even though they are now adults Sandra still hopes to see them reach their dreams since for her it was difficult to complete her schooling for lack of economic resources and because she took on the role of father and mother for her siblings since they were orphaned at a young age.  She\u2019s currently divorced living with her youngest daughter, Diana, in the southern part of Quito, Ecuador\u2019s capital city, specifically in Chillogallo.  Until a short time ago, the southern section of Quito wasn\u2019t much of a strong economic sector in the capital of the Republic of Ecuador.  Now, it\u2019s considered to be an economic strong point in the city\u2019s economy.  Enterprising families are found here that have struggled to stand out.  It\u2019s been a meeting point for natives and migrants from other cities and countries and for people from several provinces; it\u2019s been rebuilt with broad streets.\r\n\r\nSandra started a fruit and vegetable business 12 years ago and one of the biggest obstacles she\u2019s faced and one that meant a significant expenditure of money was when her oldest daughter was diagnosed with cancer which was treated and she\u2019s now in stable health.  \r\n\r\nSandra learned this activity from her aunt who taught her since she was a young girl about suppliers, accounts, etc.  Sandra developed it for her siblings so that she could move them forward and later she did it for her children.  It\u2019s very hard work that requires physical effort to lift the boxes of fruit to sort them and even the schedule requires much willpower because Sandra invests at least 12 hours daily from the moment she starts at one a.m. and goes until one p.m. or even later.\r\n\r\nSandra is asking for help to get a loan to buy seasonal fruit that has high customer demand at wholesale.  Extra income generated will be invested in her business\u2019 growth and in her youngest daughter\u2019s higher education.  Sandra says that she hopes to leave a print on her daughters so that when they are completely fulfilled they\u2019ll be sure to realize that their mother contributed to their getting there; this is why she\u2019s even planning on getting training where she was trusted enough to be lent the money at Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa which is a Kiva intermediary that trains and strengthens entrepreneurs\u2019 businesses aiming at lessening poverty in the country.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1246589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy seasonal fruit and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-11-29T23:50:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-29T23:50:32Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":626.88,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":71.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":76.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":78.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":80.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.49},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.42,"local_amount":71.77,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":74.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126220,"comment":null},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":75.78,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":78.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516827,"comment":null},{"amount":79.73,"local_amount":76.89,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":79.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068683,"comment":null},{"amount":81.49,"local_amount":78.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":81.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494949,"comment":null},{"amount":82.09,"local_amount":79.17,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":82.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524878,"comment":null},{"amount":83.4,"local_amount":80.44,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133182,"comment":null},{"amount":170.3,"local_amount":164.24,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":170.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-09T23:43:15Z","paid_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502519,"name":"Mame Coumba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mame Coumba est une femme mari\u00e9e qui habite au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

She\u2019s single but has a little one-year-old son.  She lives with her mother and brother in their own house and they all share the struggle to get ahead.  \n\nGraciela\u2019s work consists in buying and selling lumber.  She buys chunks of wood from various sawmills located near her house and she takes them to her workshop to process into simple pieces, either slats or boards.  She then places everything she makes in her warehouse and then sells them from there individually.  She does all this process between the sawmills and the sales point at home.  \n\nShe\u2019s been working this way for a year and is doing very well.  She\u2019s very happy that she\u2019s doing well because her profit margin is good since she uses up all her product.  Now that she\u2019s doing this work, she does not have to wait for the money her ex husband earns since now she too can contribute to her home\u2019s economy.  She has her ex husband\u2019s unconditional support and they work together to provide all the best for their family which is why she\u2019s asking for a 2,500 sol loan to buy lumber to start the process of turning it into slats and boards again.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1246623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy lumber.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-30T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-30T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":387.31},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":378.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":412.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":427.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":435.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":458.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":151.05,"local_amount":387.31,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":391.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188968,"comment":null},{"amount":147.53,"local_amount":378.29,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":382.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572865,"comment":null},{"amount":160.87,"local_amount":412.48,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":416.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122519,"comment":null},{"amount":166.87,"local_amount":427.86,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":432.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868347,"comment":null},{"amount":169.77,"local_amount":435.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":439.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577175,"comment":null},{"amount":178.91,"local_amount":458.74,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":463.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529419,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T14:32:38Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502668,"name":"Gredel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gredel, de 42 a\u00f1os, es una mujer buena, amable y alegre, esta casada con Kelin y fruto de su matrimonio tiene dos hijos de 23 y 21 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en una casa propia en donde comparte sus d\u00edas a lado de sus dos hijos y su esposo con quien trabaj\u00f3 mucho para mejorar sus condiciones de vida y para que no les falte nada.\nEl trabajo de Gredel, consiste en la venta de diversos productos, entre las cosas que vende tiene productos de belleza, perfumer\u00eda, cosm\u00e9ticos, y mas, adem\u00e1s de prendas de vestir de temporada que trae de otras ciudades para venderlos bajo el sistema crediticio entre sus amigas, vecinas, familiares y compa\u00f1eros de trabajo.

Aunque la separaci\u00f3n fue una prueba muy dif\u00edcil tanto para sus hijos como para ella, juntos han formado una familia ejemplar. Viven en el barrio de Chimbacalle que est\u00e1 ubicado en el sector sur de la ciudad de Quito, capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Hasta hace pocos a\u00f1os el sector sur de la ciudad de Quito, no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles. Chimbacalle en donde reside Lidia, es un barrio con una alta actividad comercial que es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y que aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios. Ventas  ambulantes, ni\u00f1os trabajando, familias con necesidad son muchos de los cuadros que se visualiza en este sector. \nLidia se dedica a la venta ambulante de ropa casual desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, este emprendimiento fue muy importante para ella, pues ser\u00eda el sustento para ella y sus hijos a partir de la separaci\u00f3n, si bien es cierto, antes se dedicaba a estas ventas como un hobby para aportar con un ingreso adicional a su hogar, luego se convirti\u00f3 en su trabajo a tiempo completo y ahora son esos ingresos los que proveen de educaci\u00f3n y bienestar a sus hijos. En un inicio, solo vend\u00eda cosm\u00e9ticos pero sus clientes demandaban tambi\u00e9n ropa y ahora, cada d\u00eda dedica desde 6 o m\u00e1s horas a recoger pedidos de sus clientes, a clasificar la ropa nueva que tiene, a entregar el pedido en la direcci\u00f3n de cada cliente, a cobrar las cuentas pendientes. Todo esto, sin descuidar la atenci\u00f3n a sus hijos ayud\u00e1ndoles con las tareas, revisando y estudiando con ellos.

She married young, but she was able to finish high school. She\u2019s currently separated and raising her children on her own \u2013 they\u2019re 13, 9 and 6 years old. Although the separation was a difficult time for her children and herself, together they have since become an exemplar family. They live in the Chimbacalle neighborhood that\u2019s located in the south of the city of Quito, which is the capital of the Republic of Ecuador. Up until the last few years, the southern part of Quito was not considered as playing a major part in the economy of the city, but now it\u2019s considered one of the city\u2019s economical strengths. In this area you\u2019ll find determined families who have fought to get ahead. From natives to migrants from other cities and countries, this area has been the meeting point of people from various provinces and has been reconstructed with extensive streets. Chimbacalle, where Lidia resides, is a very commercial neighborhood that is constantly growing and lends itself to the economic growth of the city. There are parks with big green spaces where families meet on the weekends. There is access to a great number of services and the people in this area, with determination, use every opportunity that presents itself to establish new businesses. In this area, you will see street vendors, working children and families in need.\r\nLidia is a street vendor and she's been selling casual clothing for 5 years. This undertaking was very important for her, as it was the only livelihood she had for her herself and her children since the separation. Previous to the separation, she worked as a street vendor and brought in some extra money, but it was more of a hobby; afterwards it became her fulltime job and the income now provides the education and wellbeing of her children. In the beginning, she sold only cosmetics, but there was demand for clothing, so she now dedicates about 6 hours or more each day to taking down orders from her clients, classifying the new clothing she has, delivering the orders to each address and collecting outstanding accounts. All of that work, while still attending to her children; helping them with homework, going over lessons and studying.\r\nLidia is requesting a loan to buy wholesale merchandise in order to get more discounts on her final bill. This will help increase her earnings so that one day she can accomplish her dream: owning her own clothing store that will help sustain her family and provide her children the opportunity to earn professional degrees that will take them further in life. Lidia is grateful that Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa believed in her enough to provide her with a loan and the training needed to visualize and project her business into the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1246486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Por otro lado quisiera sembrar pasto para alimentar a su ganado vacuno y de esta manera incrementar su producci\u00f3n de leche.  Con esto, pretende incrementar sus ventas y por ende sus ingresos.  Es por ello que ha cre\u00eddo conveniente obtener un pr\u00e9stamo de 1500 nuevos soles en Edpyme Alternativa. \n","en":"Norma, 45, has a spouse and two children in her care.  She lives in her own house made of substantial materials with her husband and children.  The house is located in Caser\u00edo La Pala belonging to Tambogrande District.  She lives in the rural part of the district but does have electricity. \r\n\r\nNorma\u2019s economic activity is raising and selling cattle, producing milk to sell fresh in the zone.  She works permanently and has an established clientele.  She also raises small farm animals like pigs, sheep and barnyard fowl.  Norma has more than 6 years\u2019 experience in animal husbandry businesses.  Her husband works in agriculture on inherited land.  With the income they both earn they contribute towards moving their home forward.\r\n\r\nNorma would like day to day to tend to more customers with respect to the milk sales and this is why she wants to buy much more milk to resell later.  On the other hand, she\u2019d like to plant grass to feed her cattle to also increase milk production.  With this, she intends to increase her sales and as a result her income too.  This is why she\u2019s thought it advisable to request a 1,500 new sol loan from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1246723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Nazgul is 27 years old, married, and has a wonderful son. As the main source of income, Nazgul raises livestock. After starting this business with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS), through hard work Nazgul has developed it to the point where it currently earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Presently, Nazgul's herd includes 4 cows, 4 horses and 10 sheep. She sells their milk and dairy products from her home. Thanks to her business profits, Nazgul can pay for her family's main expenses.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Nazgul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional livestock. This will allow her to increase production of milk and, concomitantly, her family income. Nazgul plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business.

She works as a medical assistant in the local hospital. Her salary is 9,221 som. However, as Lena is the main income provider for her family, she also works in animal husbandry. She started her business with 5,000 som 33 years ago. Thanks to persistent work, she has been able to develop her farm so that milk sales provide her with a monthly profit of 6,000 som. Today she has one cow and three steer on her farm. \r\n\r\nWith long term development of her farm in mind, Lena turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 som to purchase four cows, which would allow her to increase her milk production and as a result her family's income. Lena plans to invest this new income to develop her farm and eventually to buy a home for her son.

","en":"Naarkul is a 58-year-old married woman. She did not complete her college education, but she has worked in farming for many years and has a wealth of experience. She started her business with 7,500 som in 1992. Thanks to persistent work, Naarkul was able to develop her farm and it now brings her a monthly profit of 5,000 som. Naarkul's husband and daughter actively help her run the business. They organize milk sales. Today she has two cows, one steer, and five sheep on her farm. \r\n\r\nWith long term development of her farm in mind, Naarkul turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 som to purchase a cow. A new cow will allow her to increase milk production to meet demand. She plans to invest the extra income in future development of her farm and to renovate her furniture.

is 40-year-old Rugiatu. She is married and has two children, 21 and 7 years old. They are both school-going children. She has one additional dependent.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Rugiatu established her baby clothing and jewelry business. She began her business because her mother died when she was a child. Her father could not take good care of her, so he had to take her to a close friend who was a trader. She did not think it fit for her to attend school because she was not willing to pay her school fees. Instead, she was made into a house girl for several years. Later, he died and then her elder brother took her. They could barely feed her, let alone train her in school.  \r\n\r\nShe started trading with him in order to help in the running of the home. She has been a trader ever since she was a child and started her own business years later.  \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 740,000 every month from this business. Rainy season is her major challenge for her business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000. \r\n\r\nRugiatu has already received and successfully repaid three loans, and now she requires a new loan in order to purchase women's underwear - 40 dozen @ Le 18,000; women's blouses - 20 dozen @ Le 150,000; baby wrappers - 3 dozen @ Le 216,000. The balance of Le 132,000 will be used as transport. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Rugiatu plans to build a house and open a shop for her growing business. She wants her children to have a good education. The loan will help her as it is her only additional income. Her business is growing gradually and require enough capital to operate effectively, so she is looking forward to paying her loan in order to acquire subsequent loans.

Meteda, is a devoted entrepreneur who lives in northern coastal plain of Papua, Indonesia. Papua is one if the poorest of Indonesia\u2019s provinces and is plagued by social unrest. By selling Nazava Water Filters Meteda and his wife can acquire additional daily income. In just 3 months, Meteda sold 100 water filters and provided over 500 people with access to safe and affordable drinking water. \n\nMeteda sells water filters to both rich and poor because everybody is in need of ways to clean their drinking water. Compared to buying water, households save $132 USD per year using Nazava water filters, which enable them to purify rain, well or river water and make it safe to drink. \n\nThe water filters that Nazava sells are assembled on the Indonesian Island of Java 3000 km from Mr. Meteda. Shipping them takes often more than 3 weeks. \n\n\u201cTransport takes very long and I currently have the cash for just 12 filters, that\u2019s why I often have to disappoint consumers because I quickly run out of stock\u201c, says Mr, Meteda.\n\nTo fulfill the high need of Nazava water filters in his region, Meteda desires to buy a larger amount at reduced transport costs. \n\nWith a 1100 USD loan, Mr Meteda can make safe drinking water available to 500 people in just 1 month. The loan allows him to purchase around 100 water filters at a reduced price and with reduced transportation costs. This will help more households in obtaining safe drinking water, augment their disposable income as well as the profit for Meteda\u2019s family. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1246858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a larger stock of water filters and increase the access to safe and affordable drinking water in his region","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Sentani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2012-11-30T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-30T15:50:01Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meteda","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":644,"local_amount":644,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":644,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347132283,"comment":null},{"amount":234.32,"local_amount":234.32,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":234.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356712720,"comment":null},{"amount":221.68,"local_amount":221.68,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":221.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365109111,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-30T20:54:52Z","paid_date":"2013-05-20T08:54:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502453,"name":"Gulbahor","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0443\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0440 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0413\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430. \u0415\u0439 28 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0440 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0430. \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0440 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443 \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0440 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0438.

She is married and has 3 young children at home. Their living conditions are hard. Like all women living in 'kishlak' settlements, she works in the field to earn money to support her family, and she also raises cattle. In order to feed their children, Aziza's husband went to Russia to make money. Once he returned home, he again began to work in animal husbandry and growing crops. Aziza mainly grows barley, and also has an orchard where she grows apples and pears. She has been doing this business for over 10 years, and her husband helps her. She sells her produce to local residents at a lower price than they would pay at the bazaar, as there is no middle-man. She wants to earn more money so she can finish the house that she started building a few years ago. Aziza is seeking a loan of 3,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy construction materials like cement, bricks, wood, and so on. She is waiting for your kind assistance.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1235696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

She is not married and she lives with her parents.  She is a very focused and hard-working young woman.  Farogat did not have an opportunity to go to university and receive a higher specialization after she graduated from high school, so she decided to become an entrepreneur and to fulfill her plans that way.  With that goal in mind, she completed the \"Get Ahead\" course organized by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her business and becoming successful in that sphere.  Farogat wants to start a business buying and selling children's clothing.  She would like to use the income from her business to buy the necessary things for her dowry, such as clothing, items of gold, perfume, etc, as she plans to get married if she meets a good young man.  Farogat is asking for a loan of 3,000 somoni to buy the goods to start her business.  She is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":301.48,"image":{"id":1246274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
