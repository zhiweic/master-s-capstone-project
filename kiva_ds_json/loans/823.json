Paola gracias a este trabajo, ha podido salir adelante como madre soltera cabeza de familia, pues tiene un hijo de 3 a\u00f1os a quien su padre nunca ha aportado ninguna ayuda. Debido a que su taller lo mont\u00f3 con muy bajo capital, Paola no cuenta con todas las herramientas de trabajo necesarias, es por esto que busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de un compresor con aer\u00f3grafo para pintar sus productos con mayor calidad.\nPaola de esta manera podr\u00e1 ofrecer a sus clientes una mejor calidad en sus productos, por lo que aumentar\u00e1 sus ventas considerablemente.

About two years ago, she was working in a shop making pi\u00f1atas, advertisements on expanded polystyrene, and other products.  Since her boss left the city, he left her the clientele that he attended to she could keep serving them.  This is why she decided to start her own shop making products on expanded polystyrene, and she offers a big variety of products.  Her most-sold product is birthday pi\u00f1atas.  Thanks to this job, Paola has been able to get ahead as a single mother and head of the family.  She has a 3-year-old son whose father has never supported him with any help.  Since she started her business with very little capital, Paola doesn't have all of the necessary tools to do her job.  This is why she is looking for a loan that will offer her the possibility of buying a compressor with an airbrush so she can paint her products with better quality.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Paola will be able to offer her customers a better quality in her products, which will increase her sales considerably.  Additionally, Paola hopes to equip her store with the necessary tools so it can be more attractive for new customers so she can progress with her business.

They chose their name because of the place where they live.  The community is peaceful and has all services like schools, a health center, electricity, drainage, potable water, etc.  All of the people in the area have access to these services.\r\n\r\nFederico is the representative of the group.  He is 38 and has been married to his wife, Alejandra, for 17 years.  Together they have 4 children, 3 of whom are in school.  Alexa is 3, Jonathan is 8 and in elementary school, and Ivan is 15 and in high school.\r\n\r\nFederico has made a living raising sheep for more 15 years.  He tells us that he started this business because he learned it from his father.  He has requested a loan to buy 5 lambs, and he will use the rest to buy fodder, corn, and feed.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that one of his biggest difficulties is when he doesn't have the necessary resources to buy feed. Federico believes that this is one of the reasons his sheep get sick, and when this happens, Federico has to buy anti-parasitics and vitamins to apply to the sheep. \r\n\r\nHe says, \"The loan is going to benefit me a lot because I will be able to buy corn.

That's why they have to outsource the service, and pay a bit more for this job.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to succeed in expanding their business, improve their production process, and increase the volume of their purchases in order to get discounts. \r\n\r\nThis is why why she is applying for her credikiva loan, her first from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy an industrial sewing machine, and invest the balance in insoles, leather and glue, in order to make new designs and market them. This way she will meet her requirement for modernity,  justifying in this way the investment.

Esta actividad la inici\u00f3 porque siendo profesora de manualidades,  sus estudiantes ten\u00edan la necesidad de comprar las materias primas para trabajar en sus clases, as\u00ed fue que se ide\u00f3 la forma de vend\u00e9rselas ella misma y tambi\u00e9n de comercializar los productos que sabia hacer. Con sus ahorros empez\u00f3 la tarea y poco a poco   agreg\u00f3 la venta de insumos artesanales, hasta que finalmente adicion\u00f3 productos de miscel\u00e1nea cuando compr\u00f3 su primera vitrina en una oportunidad ofrecida por una amiga.

Su meta es continuar con el crecimiento de su negocio y fomentar para su hijo un futuro lleno de muchos \u00e9xitos. Su mayor desaf\u00edo ante la creciente clientela, es que su capital de trabajo se torna insuficiente para las expectativas que ella tiene y este es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 insumos artesanles \u00fatiles escolares, chancletas, desechables, cosm\u00e9ticos y mercanc\u00eda variada, para responder a su clientela y esto es lo que hace que su inversi\u00f3n sea exitosa.  ","en":"Katherine is a 25-year-old married woman with a 4-year-old son. She has undertaken an activity to produce income, which is making and decorating  products by hand from a foamy material. She also sells novelty items and craft supplies. She started this business because, as the craft instructor, she realized her students needed to buy primary materials.It occurred to her that she could sell the supplies and also the products she learned to make. \r\n\r\nWith her savings, she started the business and slowly added sales of handicraft supplies. She eventually added miscellaneous items when she bought her first showcase in an opportunity offered by a friend. Her father helped her. With his visionary spirit, he offered her his well-located house so that she could give handicraft classes. She also uses it as a commercial space, where she sells supplies and all the things the local population needs. \r\n\r\nKatherine bought the infrastructure little by little on credit. In this way, she was able to buy more display cases and stock them. In addition to her business, she offers photocopying and sells cellular minutes. Her goal is to continue growing her business and building a future full of successes for her son. Her major challenge, given her growing clientele, is that her working capital turnover is insufficient to meet her expectations.This is why she came to Kiva credit.

She is a young \"Porte\u00f1a\" (someone born in Puerto Colombia), who has always lived surrounded by the beach, breeze, sea, and love of her family.  With her husband, they started a business through which they sell items for families, like supplies, food, soft drinks, and beverages, in a community that makes purchases every day for their families.  Her main customers are housewives, who pay mainly with cash.  Before she had this business, Rosa tried to get a job unsuccessfully.  This is why she started the store with her husband.  At first, they had very little investment and a small selection, but as time passed, and with their work ethic and good customer service, they were able to capitalize on their profits and acquire fixed assets.  The area where the store is located is very popular and is characterized by having a lot of kids playing soccer in its dusty streets under the incessant and customary Caribbean sun.  The loud sound of salsa music is also heard, which the townspeople like to share.  This is part of the cultural landscape where Rosa lives.  She doesn't have competition with her business because she is always worried about being friendly and accomodating each customer, keeping their budget in mind.  Currently, Rosa is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she has had with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy supplies to increase her selection and her sales and to generate greater income to continue benefiting her

Her oldest son attends the university studying Civil Industrial Engineering.  His dream is to become a professional.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity provided by Fondo Esperanza because the loan will allow her to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nThe training she\u2019s received has taught her to organize her business\u2019 bookkeeping better and she now keeps track of her earnings and expenditures.  With respect to the communal bank group she belongs to, it is very responsible and committed so Elizabeth feels very comfortable.\r\n\r\nCuric\u00f3 is located in the Maule Region in the center of the country.

He is a good fisherman thanks to the experience he has in the sea.   He works from 2 in the afternoon until 6 in the morning.

She is 25 years old and the mother of two small children, who are one and six years old.  She loves them very much and it is for their sake that she goes out every day motivated because she is both mother and father for them since her spouse abandoned them.  However, in spite of all that, she got ahead because her children are the most important thing to her.  Her home is in the city of Nazca, a city that is known for having one of the biggest tourist attractions in the country, the Nazca Lines.  These lines are drawn over an vast expanse of desert and, according to some studies, they would have served as a calendar for the Nazca culture in centuries past.  It is also known for its hot climate and, above all, for the friendliness of its inhabitants.  When she has free time she loves to listen to music and to take the opportunity to eat one of her favorite dishes, the delicious escabeche.  She wasn't able to finish her legal studies because her parents didn't have enough money.  This is why she is working hard, so that her children will be better than she is.\r\n\r\nWith much effort and saving, Gaby was able to buy cars and so she has a business renting cars for taxi services.  She works around 12 hours a day.  She thinks her business is going well because she puts a lot of effort into getting ahead since her children's well-being depends on it.  This is what motivates her to do things well every day.\r\n\r\nGaby is very thankful to Kiva's lenders, as it is thanks to the help they have given her that she can perform maintenance on her cars and refurbish them.  This will allow her to rent safe vehicles, which will help her avoid accidents and which will make her customers feel safer and keep renting her cars.  This will allow her to improve her income and get ahead and fight to make her greatest dream a reality: to have her own home and for her children to be respectable

Their house is located in the city of Imperial. This city is known for having a hot climate in every season of the year. It is also a city that has agriculture as its main economic activity and the people are very generous. Cinthia used to work in the fields, but with a lot of hard work, saving, and the support of her husband, she decided to have a business that sells grocery items. She thinks things are going well for her business because God is always with her, in the good and the bad. And He has given her the best gift that a person could have, which is her daughter. She works every day to help her get ahead and also so that her customers will feel comfortable in her business.\r\n\r\nCinthia is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to the support they\u2019ve provided her she will be able to buy shelves, counters, and vitrines. Currently she hangs her products from nails in the wall and from a small counter that her husband built for her, but it is old now. With these improvements she will be able to show her products in a better way and have her business better organized. Then her customers will see that her business is clean and they will feel more confident in buying her products. That way she can continue working every day to make her big dream a reality: \u201cTo give her daughter a good education and to see her become a professional.\u201d

south-east of Ukraine. Tatyana sells women's clothing - dresses, skirts, blouses - at one of the main local markets. Her clients pre-pay for their orders since this results in a lower price, and have access to items from local producers. Tatyana has been in this line of work since the nineties. Currently, she has 45,000 hryvnia worth of goods and earns roughly 4,000 hryvnia per month.\r\n\r\nTatyana has turned to Kiva for a loan of 21,000 hryvnia in order to stock her shop with seasonal merchandise. The clothes she offers to her customers are always beautiful and stylish as they are unique and have no equivalents on the market.

Thanks to the money she earned, she is able to educate her son who studies in an external degree program at one of the colleges.  Likewise, the family was able to buy new kitchen furniture.  \r\n \r\nThis time, Irina has applied for a loan as she wants to prepare her kiosk for Spring.  She will reequip her kiosk and buy the raw materials for weaving artificial flowers and wreaths for the Easter holidays.  Irina herself will do the weaving, and her son is also ready to help her with the business.  They are planning to return to their earlier merchandise and to resume selling sheets towards Summer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":901305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy the

Yuryi has a large piece of land, on which there are three 10x60m greenhouses, as well as two separate greenhouses for seedlings.  This year, Yuryi invested 80,000 hryven in the installation of heating in all the greenhouses, which has fundamentally increased his business' potential.  Yuryi has been farming for 10 years now and has 200,000 hryven invested in his farm.  He spends about 43,000 hryven every year buying seed and greenhouse film.\r\n\r\nYuryi would like to invest additional funds, received through Kiva, in purchasing greenhouse film for 4,000 hryven, radish seed for 2,000 hryven, as well as coal for 9,000 hryven.  Yuryi needs to prepare his greenhouses and the land for the growing season.  In the fall, he had purchased a load of coal, but because of the strong freezes this winter, its use was more than expected.  Because of this, he now needs to buy additional coal.  Yuryi wants very much to invest in the improvement of his home.  You see, it's a big house, but it needs repairs.  Very recently, Yuryi installed new windows and poured concrete floors.  For now, there is no money for repairs because the family has decided to invest all their funds in the greenhouses.  Otherwise there will be nothing to live on

There Alexander manufactures exclusive forged works:  handrails, gates, furniture, various pedestals and racks, etc.  Nothing he produces is made from a pattern.  He approaches each work individually and creates outright miracles.  Alexander has no competition to speak of.  His goods are in demand, and he has his own client base.  He has been working in this business for 9 years now.  \r\n\r\nAlexander is planning to invest the loan of 12,000 hryven, received through Kiva, in purchasing additional equipment for his blacksmith shop.  He wants to buy grinders, drills, etc.  Alexander is a true master craftsman.  Everything he makes is carefully done and unique.  The client always receives something tailor-made since Alexander does not clone his own works.  Additional, quality tools will help Alexander to better manage his work and to execute it even more artfully.  Moreover, with the help of a few spare tools, Alexander will also be able to furnish his hired workers with the necessary materials for working."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1055235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to

She lives with Luis, her husband of 30 years. Together they have 5 children, all minors whom Nancy cares for in their home in Cullpa Alta.\r\n\r\nBecause her children are all small, she has to invest a lot of effort in order to move her children ahead. While her husband earns a living in the noble vocation of bricklayer, she begins each day preparing exquisite homemade food to sell. On the weekends she prepares local specialties and soups for the guests who come to eat. Because Nancy has been doing this work for 10 years now, the local people know and appreciate her very much. What's more, Nancy is the only person in the area who provides this service. Since she is such a hardworking woman, she spends her free time selling a variety of clothing to the people in her area, who feel grateful toward her, since she allows them to buy some items on credit, with payment later. Now she would like to increase her earnings in order to open a clothing store, a stable place of business. By doing so, she would no longer need to sell the clothing walking house to house.  \r\n\r\nNancy belongs to the supportive group \"Manos Fuertes\" and this is her fifteenth loan with Kiva's partner, MFP. At MFP she feels herself being developed, since she receives help with which she can progress in her business. In return for the help she receives, Nancy promises to be punctual in making her payments. Additionally, she likes working with the association because the people are responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nWhen she receives the loan, Nancy will invest the funds in the purchase of necessary ingredients with which to prepare her food, and in the purchase of clothing to sell in her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1017841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy common and necessary ingredients for her food business as well as to buy clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4015.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455711,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T21:29:31Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402102,"name":"Sahar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sahar is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband S'ood appears in her Kiva profile photo inside the house.\r\n\r\nSahar is a 35-year-old woman, she is married and a mother with three sons and one daughter, her husband is employed with a low salary, but not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nSahar is requesting a 2,000 USD loan from FATEN to help her cover the costs of purchasing new living room seats and dining room furniture to improve living conditions in her house.

She feels very fortunate to be there; everybody knows her and she\u2019s watched many of the children grow up who today call her \u201ct\u00eda\u201d (auntie) because she feels as if she were since she\u2019s watched so many of them grow and develop.  That\u2019s the secret she has to stay in business so far; she earns good profits that help her contribute to household expenses.  Since her husband\u2019s a locksmith by profession many know him because he\u2019s the one that helps them with problems with keys and other things at their homes.  Her plan is to acquire a comfortable, spacious locale to sell not only candy but also food and other lunch box items for the children she loves so much.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cJatary Ayllu\u201d communal bank and this is the second MFP loan she was invited to be part of by the rest of the members which is why she promises to be punctual with her installment payments because she likes the association since they are responsible and mutually supportive people.\r\n\r\nIf Luzmila were to get your support, she will use the requested money to buy merchandise like candy and assorted toys.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1017997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy candy and an assortment of toys.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":80.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":89.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":98.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":101.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":105.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":111.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":115.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":121.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.97},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.79,"local_amount":164.78,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":165.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714014,"comment":null},{"amount":33.55,"local_amount":89.47,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":89.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202910,"comment":null},{"amount":34.21,"local_amount":91.21,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":91.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098581,"comment":null},{"amount":36.97,"local_amount":98.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":98.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401424,"comment":null},{"amount":37.95,"local_amount":101.18,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:14Z","rounded_local_amount":101.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455716,"comment":null},{"amount":39.7,"local_amount":105.89,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":106.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451409,"comment":null},{"amount":41.76,"local_amount":111.36,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":111.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446597,"comment":null},{"amount":43.5,"local_amount":115.99,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":116.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052619,"comment":null},{"amount":45.57,"local_amount":121.52,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":121.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-08T09:20:05Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402271,"name":"08.01.11 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H\u1ed3ng is 41 years old and married with 2 children.

Elvis tiene un hijo: Airton, de 17 a\u00f1os de edad y a pesar de que no viva junto a \u00e9l; lo ama y hace todo lo posible para brindarle una buena calidad de vida. Es por ello que hace 15 a\u00f1os, compr\u00f3 10 hect\u00e1reas de terrenos agr\u00edcolas donde siembra caf\u00e9 y pl\u00e1tanos en grandes cantidades. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de la agricultura es estar en el campo, cultivando y cuidando los sembr\u00edos que pronto dar\u00e1n frutos. Seg\u00fan cuenta en \u00e9pocas de cosecha, se dedica al acopio de caf\u00e9, para eso compra y vende a una empresa de producci\u00f3n, obteniendo as\u00ed un dinero extra que suma tambi\u00e9n a la comercializaci\u00f3n de sus propios granos. Pero la actividad a la que dedica la mayor parte de su tiempo, es el negocio de cabinas de Internet, locutorio (donde se hacen llamadas telef\u00f3nicas) y cabinas de proyecci\u00f3n de pel\u00edculas.

As they are old, he is lovingly caring for them in his own house, located in the town of Yapaz Bajo, San Luis de Shuaro district - Chanchamayo. Elvis has one son, Airton, of 17 years of age. Although they don't live together, Elvis loves him and does everything possible to provide him with a high quality of life. \r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that, 15 years ago, Elvis bought 10 hectares of land, where he plants coffee and bananas in large quantities. What he likes most about agriculture is being in the fields, growing and taking care of the plants that will soon bear fruits. During the harvest season Elvis stocks up coffee, thus he buys and sells to a production company. This way he gains extra money, on top of trading his own beans. \r\n\r\nBut the activity on which he spends most of his time is his shop of internet booths, phone booths, and movie showing booths. He is doing very well, as there isn't any other such shop in the area; he is the only one in this trade. For that, he is thinking every day on how to improve customer support and the level of service.  \r\n\r\nThis will be his fifth loan received from MFP. Elvis counts on its collaboration to be able to realize his plans. He commits, one more time, to fulfill the payment for his installments, as he did with his previous loans. He is also pleased to be a member of his communal bank \"El Palomar al \u00c9xito\", as all its members are responsible people.  \r\n\r\nElvis, when obtaining this support, will invest the requested money into paying for his machines' maintenance. He will also buy some sacks of organic compost, to fertilize his coffee plantation.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1018024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay for his machines' maintenance and to buy sacks of compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447810,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-02T22:19:44Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403317,"name":"Ing","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ing and his wife are farmers.

The crops that Vilma and her partner have managed with great enthusiasm, have greatly helped them make progress in their lives.  She begins working her land very early in the morning, because she knows that the care she gives to her coffee crop will determine the quality of the product she will obtain.  What she enjoys most about the work is caring for her crop and she feels happy to have a good production.  She\u2019s been growing coffee for more than 15 years, however she considers taking the harvest to supply centers in the area to be very difficult, but this is where she gets the best prices for her products.  This loan will allow her to hire laborers who will care for her plants.  In the future she hopes to be able to plant more coffee plants.   This will be her second loan through MFP and she knows that her responsibility is to make her payments on time.  She is a loyal member of her communal bank.  She will use the 1,000 PEN to buy coffee plants so that she can increase production on her land.  She will use the rest to hire field hands to help her plant them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1018619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy coffee plants and hire field hands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":86.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":104.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":108.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":112.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":115.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.29,"local_amount":174.1,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":174.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714022,"comment":null},{"amount":33.98,"local_amount":90.63,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":91.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202918,"comment":null},{"amount":35.56,"local_amount":94.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":95.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098589,"comment":null},{"amount":36.81,"local_amount":98.16,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":98.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401432,"comment":null},{"amount":37.87,"local_amount":100.98,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":101.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455726,"comment":null},{"amount":39.24,"local_amount":104.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451421,"comment":null},{"amount":40.84,"local_amount":108.89,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":109.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446607,"comment":null},{"amount":42.17,"local_amount":112.46,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":112.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052627,"comment":null},{"amount":43.24,"local_amount":115.31,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":115.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187733,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-03T19:17:56Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403332,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francisca, 47 years old, is married with five grown-up children and lives with her family in the village of Benito Soliven.

His responsibilities include looking after his two beloved children, as things worked out so that he has been a widower for a year. Now what he most wants is to be able to give his children a better quality of life. Lidio is a man who earns a profit. He carefully tends his coffee plantations, work that he has been doing for more than 30 years. During harvest time he has the help of daily laborers, and so he can rapidly harvest the beans and then sell them in the center where all the farmers take their coffee. Here he gets a good return on every kilo of coffee. The difficult thing for him is to transport his sacks of coffee beans to the collection center where the buyers congregate. In time, he wants to buy more cocoa and coffee plants to increase his plantings and he is prioritizing buying these as they will bring him good returns in his next harvests and he will use the profits to give his children a good life. This will be his fourth loan from MFP. He is very happy with the confidence they have shown in him and is ready to make his monthly repayments as this will enable him to access other loans. He is glad that the members of his community bank are able to work together. He will use the $1125 to buy land to grow more plants. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1018662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":260.03},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":262.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":271.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":284.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":294.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":302.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":314.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":326.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":337.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":345.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.61},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.53},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":195.9,"local_amount":522.39,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":524.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714028,"comment":null},{"amount":101.97,"local_amount":271.93,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":273.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202924,"comment":null},{"amount":106.68,"local_amount":284.49,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":285.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098595,"comment":null},{"amount":110.46,"local_amount":294.54,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":295.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401438,"comment":null},{"amount":113.61,"local_amount":302.98,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":304.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455732,"comment":null},{"amount":117.77,"local_amount":314.04,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":315.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451427,"comment":null},{"amount":122.52,"local_amount":326.71,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":328.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446613,"comment":null},{"amount":126.53,"local_amount":337.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":338.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052633,"comment":null},{"amount":129.56,"local_amount":345.49,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":346.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187739,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-05T21:50:19Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399047,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"M\u00f3nica, de 27 a\u00f1os, vive en su propia casa junto a su c\u00f3nyuge Edgar de 35 a\u00f1os y sus 02 estimados hijos a quienes desea brindar una mejor calidad de vida.

On the other hand, she finds it difficult that insect pests affect her plants and they can be difficult to deal with.

She is Alejandro\u2019s wife, and he is 42 years old. They are the parents of two beautiful daughters, Tania who is 18 years old and Maydelin who is 8 years old. They live in their own home. Claudia is an optimistic woman and always thinking of her family. \r\n\r\nSome time ago she considered opening a ceviche stand in her neighborhood to offer a good service. She began fixing up her facility so that she could make a good appearance and attract the attention of people, and now, since then, she has the help of her husband and both are dedicated to giving her customers good service.\r\n\r\nShe is in her stand very early and people passing by always get to try the tasty rich ceviche with a drink. This is how Claudia attends to her customers and why people always return to Claudia\u2019s Ceviche Stand.\r\n\r\nAt first she began with few supplies for her business and now with the loan she is requesting she will be able to buy some supplies that she lacks in her ceviche stand. This will be her sixth loan through MFP. She is ready to make her payments punctually in order to request another loan. She is a trustworthy member of her communal bank and united with her partners. With the 2,500 soles, she will buy plates and serving dishes and everything necessary for her food stand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1018811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy plates and serving dishes for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":216.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":218.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":226.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":236.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":245.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":252.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":261.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":272.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":280.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":289.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":165.29,"local_amount":434.98,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":442.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714039,"comment":null},{"amount":86.05,"local_amount":226.44,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":230.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202935,"comment":null},{"amount":90.02,"local_amount":236.89,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":241.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098606,"comment":null},{"amount":93.2,"local_amount":245.26,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":249.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401449,"comment":null},{"amount":95.87,"local_amount":252.29,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":256.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455743,"comment":null},{"amount":99.36,"local_amount":261.49,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":266.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451438,"comment":null},{"amount":103.38,"local_amount":272.04,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":276.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446624,"comment":null},{"amount":106.76,"local_amount":280.96,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":285.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052644,"comment":null},{"amount":110.07,"local_amount":289.65,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":294.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187750,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-18T17:22:48Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402147,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad, 35 years old and a single man, now lives with his mother after his father passed away. \r\n\r\nMohammad has his own business which is a humble store selling all sorts of home products, whether it be for kitchen or for the living room or even decoration pieces.

For seven years she has worked selling clay objects such as pots, stoves, vases, glasses, piggy banks, etc.  She travels on the weekend to other neighboring cities to sell, and the first days of the week she stocks up on new merchandise.  On her trips, she always has the help of one of her daughters, who helps her sell.  On her days off she also makes sales, of natural medicines to her neighbors.\r\n\r\nOver time she has seen her income improve and maintained her capital, which grows little by little.  She considers that her business is profitable because it generates good income for her and she can support her business by adding the income from her husband, who works as a professor.  It is for this reason that she wants to increase her working capital, to improve her merchandise and so have more customers.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the La Florida solidarity group and this is her third loan with MFP, where she feels well developed because she gets help to make progress in her business.  For this reason she promises to be punctual with her payments.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she likes to work in her bank because the people are responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nIf she receives her support Esperanza will invest the money requested in buying more clay pots and clay animals, which will help to save money.  This will allow her to increase her capital in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1018865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clay pots and decorations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":166.51},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":168.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":178.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":181.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":196.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":201.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":211.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":222.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":231.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":241.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.79},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.49,"local_amount":334.65,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":336.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714045,"comment":null},{"amount":66.95,"local_amount":178.51,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":179.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202941,"comment":null},{"amount":68.24,"local_amount":181.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":182.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098612,"comment":null},{"amount":73.78,"local_amount":196.73,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":197.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401455,"comment":null},{"amount":75.7,"local_amount":201.88,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":202.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455749,"comment":null},{"amount":79.23,"local_amount":211.29,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":212.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451440,"comment":null},{"amount":83.32,"local_amount":222.18,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":223.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446626,"comment":null},{"amount":86.79,"local_amount":231.45,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":232.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052646,"comment":null},{"amount":90.5,"local_amount":241.32,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":242.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187752,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-21T00:57:16Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402158,"name":"Olfat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olfat is a conservative woman who asked her husband Hashem to take her place in the photo.\r\n\r\nOlfat is a 23-year-old married lady whose husband Hashem works as a driver.
