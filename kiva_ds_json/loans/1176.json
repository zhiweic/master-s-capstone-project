She is married to Reynaldo, her business partner, and is a mother to her children. She and her husband share responsibility in attending to their young children and at the same time, earning an income for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nSusan is a balut vendor. In the Philippines, balut is a well-known egg that is sold on the sidewalk. It is an egg of ducks that had not been hatched; instead, it was cooked as a boiled egg with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is a highly nutritious food that Filipinos love to eat, especially when they feel tired as it revitalizes their energy and strength. About 450-600 pieces of balut eggs are being boiled and sold every night. She and her husband do the selling to lessen expenses for the commissions of vendors who will sell it. They earn 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales per day. \r\n\r\nSusan is requesting a loan amounting to 20,000 PHP that she will use as additional capital for her business to buy more eggs.\r\n\r\nSusan dreams to have a stall located in the market. She still will have to wait a little bit more to make this come true because she has prioritized being a mother first to her young children. For now, she and her husband will just continue to lean on each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future.

When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Kiptarus replied it would change their living standard.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Kiptarus owns the following: a cow, poultry, and a bicycle but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a mosquito net and solar power  in the household but does not have electricity, running water, a sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo

The income of the family will increase and, in case of need, they will have enough income to access regular credit products available in the country\u2019s capital market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":332.81,"image":{"id":1395475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to purchase a car for starting a taxi business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Rustavi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-27T13:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-26T13:20:06Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nariman ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":67.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":67.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":70.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":70.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":72.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":76.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":76.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78.77},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":82.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":85.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":88.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":92.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":94.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":96.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":98.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.21},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.05,"local_amount":63.05,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":63.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857616,"comment":null},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":64.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":64.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134265,"comment":null},{"amount":67.21,"local_amount":67.21,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":67.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107847,"comment":null},{"amount":67.68,"local_amount":67.68,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":67.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255381,"comment":null},{"amount":70.32,"local_amount":70.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":70.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019511,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-24T19:09:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":587116,"name":"Kousar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kousar is a 33-year-old lady who has enjoyed doing hand embroidery for many years.

Lusine started her business years ago. At that time, she was in a very difficult living condition and it was very difficult for her to tackle her financial hardships and sustain her daughter's life. After opening her catering business, Lusine was able to make a little improvement in her life and cover her daily costs. Due to her hard work and nice attitude toward people, Lusine has gained many loyal customers who prefer to come to Lusine's little cafe and enjoy tasty meals. Lusine is now more specialized in Georgian cuisine and cooks different types of meals which her customers enjoy with great pleasure. Lusine requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her start-up business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because her business isn't registered as a formal business. Lusine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only other source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard. Tamaz does all the agricultural work and works hard to insure a good harvest. They sell wine at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTamaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tamaz will purchase a milking cow.

He started working in early childhood and his small seasonal income is a primary income source for his family members. However, his earnings are not enough to cover the cost of food and everyday expenses. For this reason, Mikheil decided to start a dairy farm. \r\n\r\nMikheil's loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with reasonable terms to start-up businesses. These loans are provided to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low incomes. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase a milk cow. Mikheil will place the cow in the cattle shed located in his yard and he will sell the milk at the local market. He estimates that the family's income will increase by 150 to 200 GEL, which is a 40- to 50-percent increase. The family's living conditions will significantly improve, enabling them to access regular credit products that are currently available.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175.54,"image":{"id":1395603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a milk cow to start a dairy farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gamarjveba","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-27T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-26T19:00:07Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mikheil ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":48.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":49.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":53.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.21,"local_amount":33.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":33.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134272,"comment":null},{"amount":46.53,"local_amount":46.53,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":46.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107854,"comment":null},{"amount":46.93,"local_amount":46.93,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":46.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255388,"comment":null},{"amount":48.87,"local_amount":48.87,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":48.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019518,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-29T23:34:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":587187,"name":"Agnes Fred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is a client of Finance Sudan; she has borrowed three times before now.

She is single and the mother of a young child who is one year old. She finished secondary school. She wants to work so she can find a way to continue with her education. Right now her life revolves around her child. One of the greatest obstacles that she has is the loss of her partner, who is also not interested in their child. Diana lives with her son in the town of Rio Verde de Santo Domingo, which is the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. This city has a many businesses, as it has become an inland port of exchange between the mountainous region and the coast of the country. The various tourist attractions of the city are related to the warm climate. Many national and international tourists visit here. Most of the population of the city works in business or services related to the local inhabitants or the tourists. Diane learned how to be a photographer when she was a secondary student. Now she has a business at a local photography shop. Never the less, her income isn't sufficient. So, for the last six months, she has been augmenting her income by selling cosmetics from a catalogue. She can do this while she is at the photography shop. She shows her catalogues and the products that she has in stock, while she is in the shop. Every weekend she goes door-to-door in her city selling her products and collecting payments for them. Diana's customers are mainly women that are also requesting other products such as clothes and shoes. This is why Diana is requesting this loan. She will use the money to start selling a line of clothing and shoes by catalogue. She will also buy seasonal clothes to exhibit and show to her customers. By growing her business Diane will increase her customer base with the objective of increasing her earnings. This will help her provide a better life for her child and pay for the household necessities. The lack of capital is always an obstacle for her ability to increase her business. Now she has the opportunity to apply for her first loan from the \"Alternative Foundation\". This Foundation has provided the confidence and flexibility that she was looking for. Diana agrees to apply for a KIVA loan. She wants the world to know that the people of Ecuador have an enterprising spirit and strive to achieve their dreams despite the barriers that they face."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":630.08,"image":{"id":1396996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothes and shoes in order to provide a greater variety of goods for her business.

He has worked in agriculture since he was young.  His grandfather taught him how to do this work.  It should have been his father to teach him, but his father emigrated to another country in search of a better life.  Together with his grandfather, he worked very hard, cultivating the land to grow basic grains.  When he got older he also emigrated, but this dream was interrupted when he was discovered in a raid and sent back home to his country.  This was 7 years ago. He and his wife returned home and his wife is now pregnant. He works very hard to provide a good life for his wife and to make a nice home where they can raise a child, who is coming soon.\r\n\r\nHe has to travel to the closest city to buy supplies that he can't grow at his home.  He has to travel 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) from his home to the city and since there is no transportation, he has to bring all of his products on his back and this creates many physical ailments.  His wife does the shopping which causes the same physical problems, and in her state of pregnancy she cannot take the risk of this type of physical activity.\r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan so that he can buy bricks, cement, sand, and gravel, since he has already purchased tiles and iron - for the improvement of his home.  \r\n\r\nThe current need is to be able to buy the materials one time to take advantage of bulk discounts and also so that he can pay for transport only once to get the supplies back to his home.  His life will improve and he will have a proper home where his child can be raised without problems.\r\n\r\nIn the future he hopes to have a better life and to give a better life to his family.  He wants to continue working very hard and to stop worrying.  He wants a close-knit family and to provide a good education for his child.  He will love his child the way a father should, which was denied to him in his life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":345,"image":{"id":1397945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy bricks, cement, sand, and gravel for improving his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-28T10:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-27T10:50:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":75.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":78.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":101.25,"local_amount":101.25,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":101.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815000,"comment":null},{"amount":77.49,"local_amount":77.49,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:22:08Z","rounded_local_amount":77.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090958,"comment":null},{"amount":29.51,"local_amount":29.51,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":29.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856830,"comment":null},{"amount":136.75,"local_amount":136.75,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":136.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716617,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-26T17:01:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":587426,"name":"Agapita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agapita is 51 years old and single.

offers old-fashioned customer service to Austin and the surrounding communities with his private black car and limo chauffeur business, driving clients to and from the airport saying, \u201cI\u2019m my own competition.\u201d\r\n\r\nTired of the multiple work-related fees as a former employee of a similar business, Glen decided to work for himself. A seasoned entrepreneur, Glen says he\u2019s always had side projects to accompany his full-time job, but it was his love for cars that intrigued him enough to open a chauffeur business.\r\n\r\n\u201cProfessionally Driven by Glen Private Driver Services\u201d has been in operation for two years and created four part-time jobs in the Austin area. Glen says he would like to hire one more part-time and full-time driver in the near future. However, he is currently looking to secure any upcoming work needed for his cars. \r\n\r\nAfter going to BIG Austin, a community-wide business assistance organization, Glen was referred to nonprofit microlender, Accion Texas Inc.

","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 38 years old and has a partner and two children. He has worked in agriculture since childhood, learning the work from his father who taught his son to work very hard in order to provide for the household. Now with a house of his own Jos\u00e9 has been able to successfully meet all of his household commitments. He feels that with this work he can get by economically throughout his life, but he also works in a workshop where he is the driver. This gives him an extra income which means he can cover all of his household expenses.\r\n\r\nHe buys his family's food and the materials he needs for his work in the nearest city some 6 kilometres away. However there is limited transport and he has to wait hours for the bus.

Ella es soltera y ha trabajado cada d\u00eda por salir adelante juntamente con sus hijos. Jenny vive con sus hijos en la Parroquia Chig\u00fcilpe a 15 minutos del centro de Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Esta parroquia tiene varias viviendas de cemento y mixtas de madera con cemento. Tiene un r\u00edo que es muy visitado y en donde los turistas y habitantes practican varios deportes y adem\u00e1s tienen la oportunidad de conocer una cultura ts\u00e1chila que suele contar sus leyendas a los visitantes en medio de una fogata y camping. Santo Domingo que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nSu negocio est\u00e1 establecido en su casa, todos los d\u00edas atiende muchos clientes que acuden al bazar y papeler\u00eda que desde hace 4 a\u00f1os abre las puertas para solventar las necesidades de sus vecinos en cuanto a productos escolares, suministros de oficina, art\u00edculos de bazar incluido prendas de vestir, siempre atiende al p\u00fablico con mucho cari\u00f1o, respeto y amabilidad. Esta actividad comercial la aprendi\u00f3 gracias a su hermana quien con mucha paciencia otorg\u00f3 a Jenny informaci\u00f3n sobre proveedores, costos, demanda, etc. Le gusta mucho lo que hace ya que as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n puede dedicar su tiempo a m\u00faltiples actividades del hogar, ayudar a sus hijos en las tareas y cuidar a su hijo peque\u00f1o. Ahora tiene muchos planes para su negocio entre ellos ampliar el surtido de productos que ofrece comprando al por mayor \u00fatiles escolares como cuadernos de diferentes tama\u00f1os y modelos, l\u00e1pices, esferos, etc., todo esto con el af\u00e1n de que sus clientes encuentren todo lo que necesitan en esta temporada que los ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes empiezan un nuevo per\u00edodo de clases, para lo cual decidi\u00f3 buscar a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, instituci\u00f3n de la cual recibi\u00f3 muy buenas referencias por los cr\u00e9ditos y apoyo que brindan a microempresarios y emprendedores. Solicita un cr\u00e9dito que le ayudar\u00e1 en este paso de crecimiento laboral, ya que as\u00ed se sentir\u00e1 segura de avanzar con su negocio y sus clientes ser\u00e1n m\u00e1s y por lo tanto sus ingresos  crecer\u00e1n con los cuales podr\u00e1 ofrecer a sus hijo un mejor estilo de vida.

She is single and works every day to move forward along with her children. Jenny lives with her children in Chig\u00fcilpe parish, 15 minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, the capital city of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. This place has a very active trade since it has become an inland port of exchange between the mountains and the coast of Ecuador. This parish has many homes made of cement and a combination of wood and cement. There is a much-visited river, where the tourists and inhabitants do a lot of sports. They also have the chance to get to know the Ts\u00e1chila culture. Legends are usually told to the visitors during a bonfire and camping. Santo Domingo is the third most populated city in the region. It has activities like agriculture, ranching, fishing, and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nJenny's business is set up in her home. Every day she attends to many customers who come to the bazaar and stationery store that she opened four years ago in order to meet her neighbors needs for school supplies, office supplies, and bazaar goods including articles of clothing. She always attends to the public with a lot of affection, respect, and friendliness. She learned about this commercial activity thanks to her sister, who very patiently gave Jenny information about providers, costs, demand, etc. She really likes what she does since she can also spend her time to several activities in the home, help her children with their homework, and care for her young child. Now she has many plans for her business, among them increasing the number of products that she offers, buying school supplies like notebooks in different sizes and models, pencils, and pens wholesale. This is all so that her customers find every thing that they need at this time of year when children and young people are starting classes again. This is why she decided to seek out Fundaci\u00f3n Alternatica, an institution for which she received good references because of the loans and help that they give to micro-business owners and entrepreneurs. She is asking for a loan which will help her in this stage of business growth, since this way she will feel confident in moving forward with her business and she will have more customers. Because of this, her income will increase, and she will be able to offer her children a better lifestyle. \r\n\r\nJenny thanks each Kiva lender that decides to support her and encourages them to continue contributing to entrepreneurs and micro-business owners, since it is the best way to believe in them and their projects, which motivates them to keep fighting for a better tomorrow."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":627.48,"image":{"id":1397873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy school supplies for the back-to-school season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-28T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-27T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1635.76,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":106.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":129.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":133.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":135.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":144.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":147.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":107.11,"local_amount":106.19,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":107.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814474,"comment":null},{"amount":125.47,"local_amount":124.38,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320645,"comment":null},{"amount":129.35,"local_amount":128.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":129.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856333,"comment":null},{"amount":130.75,"local_amount":129.63,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":130.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059911,"comment":null},{"amount":134.8,"local_amount":133.64,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995244,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T15:13:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":587482,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael is 30 years old, and married to Josephine.

Juan works in agriculture, specifically growing regional produce such as banana, rice, yucca, and others. His main plantation is planted with different varieties of banana, those that are most in demand by the people. He sells his produce in the river port which is located a short distance from his land. He has been doing this work for 10 years and still remembers that, in the beginning, he suffered a lot to get established and it took a lot of effort and work. However, he kept going and was able to achieve his goals. He says that is is best by far to work independently than to work for other people as he did before as he used to be too tired. On this occasion, he is requesting $550 dollars and he is very happy to know that he will have financial support that will enable him to succeed. He also promises to make his repayments punctually. He will use the amount he is requesting to buy organic fertilizer and banana seeds to continue his planting. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":254.73,"image":{"id":1398085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer and banana seeds.

Linda is a farmer, and she has two hectares of land. She mainly plants plantains, but she complements this with other crops such as cacao and cocona. She harvests the plantains periodically to sell by the bunch wholesale in the most nearby markets. Because her land is so far away, she can't stay there permanently without moving.

She also raises animals to sell such as birds and pigs. She likes her work; she has years of experience in this business, and this has allowed her to support her family. She also says that she likes life on the farm, where she feels most peaceful and can put into practice everything she learned from her parents, who were also farmers.

They have a small child and live together in the Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n parish in Santo Domingo, the capital city of the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Commerce is quite strong in the area, since it is a land port of exchange between the mountains and the coast of Ecuador.

The residents also work in areas such as agriculture, livestock, fishing, and manufacturing.\r\nYexi opened a beauty salon three years ago. She specialized in this art in high school, and enjoys it greatly. She is constantly honing her skills through courses at various beauty centres.

Her dream is to be able to expand her beauty salon with spa services in order to be able to provide work for other people. \r\nYexi is requesting a loan which she will use to purchase adequate furniture for her business. She will buy chairs, both to provide her clients with comfort and to allow her to work comfortably. She will also buy chairs for children and furniture for the waiting room.

All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Elguja applied for credit at MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. With a loan of 4500 GEL (Georgia lari), Elguja will build a greenhouse. As soon as the greenhouse is built, he will grow mushrooms for selling. \r\n\r\nThis credit will be a great support for the family.
