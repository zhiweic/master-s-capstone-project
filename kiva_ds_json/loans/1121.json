Betty assembles metal doors, windows and stairs. This work makes a good income because the city is starting to grow and there are more construction projects that need metal carpentry services.\r\nEvery time, requests are made from work sites further away from their home. Because of this, they just bought a mototaxi to transport their work tools, which include a soldering machine, an iron cutter, and other items. Betty likes her work because she loves what she does. It is going very well for her because their clientele keeps growing, and this means that they keep making a greater income. In the future, she hopes to open her own workshop and thus increase her income and provide work opportunities for other people. This will be her sixth loan on Kiva and she is very grateful for the economic opportunity.

In particular, they have two milking cows, whose milk is used in dairy products. They also have a plot of land, where maize, haricots and potatoes are grown.

According to Credo, the family belongs in the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. \r\n\r\nWithin the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, Ana has been approved for a loan to start a family business. This start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit. The rural poor are regarded as high-risk borrowers because of their low incomes. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ana will purchase a car. Her son will help her drive to different villages to trade with dairy products and vegetables.

Jayanca with her husband and their five children, whom she loves and who are her main reason for living. She is a very friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic person who, alongside her husband, dedicates all of her efforts towards providing for her family. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and the need to begin working from a very young age to help her parents, Maximina was unable to finish her studies, which prevented her from taking on a professional degree. However, she would have liked to be a great business manager. In her free time, she likes to cook, and sometimes she cooks a delicious Lomo Saltado (a marinated sirloin dish) to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with plenty of effort and dedication, Maximina has been working in her small business selling food for several years. She also has horses which she rents out to people from her area for transport. She works every day for about 14 hours per day, and she believes that it is going well due to her good seasonings and the friendly manner in which she treats others.\r\n\r\nMaximina is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help she will be able to carry out the construction of a toilet in her home. She currently only has an underground space which she and her family use. In this way, Maximina will be able to provide her family with better security and well-being. She will continue working and putting in effort to achieve her great dream of finishing construction on her home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":216.53,"image":{"id":1351532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He makes and sells cheese curd to diversify his income. Everything started when he was 26 years old, when he inherited two plots of land from his father.

He sells his products in his town, and he would like to sell them in supermarkets because they would sell at a better price. His goals in terms of his business are to increase his number of calved cows to increase milk production, as well as to increase his production of coffee and basic grains.

They are all very responsible and hard-working. They say that they chose their name after the patron saint of their village, one of the most celebrated in their community.\r\nMagdalena is a member of this group. She tells us that she is 38 and has been married to Lucas for 20 years. Together, they have formed a family. They have three children, of whom only one goes to school because the others are still little.\r\nMagdalena has sold clothing for two years. She tells us that she started her business because her husband is often unemployed and they had many economic problems. She says \"I really like helping my husband with the household costs and our children's education. My earnings allow us to live more comfortably without worrying about finances.\" Every weekend, Magdalena travels to the capital to buy more clothing that her clients order. Every day, she goes out to sell door-to-door in other communities.\r\nMagdalena's only difficulty occurs when clients are very late in paying her. Smiling, she says \"I would also love to have a car to get around more quickly and get my orders in on time.\"\r\nMagdalena is requesting this loan for the purchase of more clothing. She plans to purchase more in-style clothing because it will be easier to sell. Her earnings will help her to cover her household costs, but above all it will pay for her children's education. For Magdalena, her children are the most important aspect of life.\r\nThe group is very happy and grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva for the loan that each of them will receive, since it will be a great help for them in expanding their businesses.

In particular, they have a 0.6-hectare plot of agricultural land, where they grow maize and haricot (beans). They sell the harvested products at local markets. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKandit requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Kandit has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with \"soft conditions\" to start or restart businesses. The program is targeted to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high risk borrowers because of their low incomes. With his credit Kandit will purchase a milking cow. After purchasing a milking cow, he will be able to produce dairy products and sell them locally. This will increase the income of his family.

She has had her business for approximately 6 years. She produces and sells Empanada (a fried dough filled with meat and vegetables). She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying flour, meat, cooking oil, vegetables and other goods.

This is a group of Haitian citizens who are now located in an area of San Pedro de Macoris, a town where the economy is based on the sugar cane industry. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable electricity and running water. The water is not potable. \r\n\r\nAgustide makes his home in a simple structure with his 4 children. He says that his most difficult challenges have been settling in a foreign city and helping his family. He plans to continue doing business and enjoying the time he spends working. He is excited to be taking out his 12th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid his previous loan and growing his business. He has had his business for 8 years, starting with a fruit and vegetable stand. He plans to use this loan to purchase cosmetics, shoes and clothes to sell. He will use the profits to reinvest and to provide for his children. He is dreaming of improving his business and returning to Haiti to start a good business there.

She has been actively involved in this business for a number of years. As the sole breadwinner, Mary uses her income to provide for the entire family. \r\n\r\nMary will use the loan to purchase supplies of maize and cassava, which will help her to improve overall \u2018Banku\u2019 sales. With the new profits from her expanded business, Mary plans to diversify the type of products that she sells, hence adapting to changing customer preferences."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1351196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase maize and cassava, to help with her \u2018Banku\u2019 sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Twifo Praso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-05-18T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-17T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":61.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372902235,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:47:29Z","rounded_local_amount":61.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381678243,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":61.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390542462,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":61.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399791316,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T22:42:59Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T11:10:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559949,"name":"Emae","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emae is 42 years old, married, and has three children.

de Arena y dice que le pusieron ese nombre al grupo pues para los integrantes los cr\u00e9ditos son como los granitos de arena: poco a poquito hacen un gran cerro y es por eso que \u00e9l y sus compa\u00f1eros aprovechan sus cr\u00e9ditos para mejorar sus negocios. Don Eduardo se dedica a transportar grava, arena, piedra, etc. Para obras en construcci\u00f3n, dice que tiene con esta actividad desde hace m\u00e1s de cinco a\u00f1os y que empez\u00f3 con este negocio porque no le alcanzaba con lo que ganaba de la siembra, aparte que su esposa la tuvieron muy enfermita ya que le dio c\u00e1ncer pero gracias a quimioterapias que le hicieron pudo salir adelante. Don Eduardo platica que a diario se hace de dos a tres viajes (transportando el material de construcci\u00f3n) ya que tiene que salir a otro lado a conseguir la grava o arena que vende a unos bancos de arena que est\u00e1n en el estado de M\u00e9xico y en la poblaci\u00f3n de Ocampo y le queda un poco retirado de su comunidad, pero es donde consigue los mejores precios y as\u00ed \u00e9l le puede ganar algo. Dice que est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para seguir invirtiendo en el material para la construcci\u00f3n y que tambi\u00e9n lo ocupara para darle mantenimiento a su carro de volteo. Las otras integrantes del grupo se llaman Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, Sonia, F\u00e9lix y Marisol ellas invertir\u00e1n sus cr\u00e9ditos en la compra de material para elaborar costuras, en la compra de llantas para un taxi de servicio p\u00fablico, para la compra de ropa para dama y caballero y para la compra de fierro viejo para despu\u00e9s venderlo por kilo.\n\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Don Eduardo is 52 years old. He is a native of the indigenous Mazahua community.  He belongs to the Granito de Arena (Grain of Sand) communal bank. He says they gave the group that name because the loans are like grains of sand: little by little they form a mountain and that is why he and his companions take advantage of the loans to improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nDon Eduardo transports gravel, sand, stone, etc. for construction projects. He says he has run his business for more than five years and that he started it because he was not earning enough from farming. In addition his wife was very ill from cancer, however thanks to chemotherapy she was able to recover. \r\n\r\nDon Eduardo notes that he makes two or three trips every day (transporting construction materials) and has to travel a distance to pick up the gravel or sand that he then sells to some sand dealers in the state of Mexico and in the town of Ocampo. This takes him a bit far from his own community, but that is where he gets the best prices so that he can earn something for himself.\r\n\r\nHe says he is requesting a loan in order to continue investing in construction materials and that he will also use it to do maintenance on his dump truck.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, Sonia, F\u00e9lix and Marisol. They will invest their loans in the purchase of sewing materials, tires for a public taxi service, men and women\u2019s clothing and scrap metal to sell later by the kilo.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1342541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"to purchase sand, gravel and rocks to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-05-18T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-17T23:40:08Z","loan_amount":3875,"lender_count":124,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":47000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3925.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4380.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4476.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4575.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4675.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4778.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4883.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4990.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5100.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5212.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":323.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":377.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":402.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":429.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1057.99,"local_amount":12832.42,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":12882.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373049001,"comment":null},{"amount":763.39,"local_amount":9259.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":9295.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840170,"comment":null},{"amount":389.23,"local_amount":4721.05,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4739.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698520,"comment":null},{"amount":402.63,"local_amount":4883.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4902.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698521,"comment":null},{"amount":838.16,"local_amount":10166.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10205.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944795,"comment":null},{"amount":423.6,"local_amount":5137.81,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5157.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227878,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T09:30:58Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T20:28:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559960,"name":"Desiree","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Desiree works hard to support her family.

","en":"Victoria is a 37 year-old single mother with one son. She is a hard-working woman who is also responsible for supporting her mother, who she still lives with. She helps with household expenses while her mother helps care for Victoria's son. Victoria sells bedspreads and shoes of various brands by catalog. She says she learned the business six years ago in order to support her son. She also works in a clothing store where she is paid on commission, but  says that amounts to very little, which is why she learned the business of bedspread and shoe sales. She says that thanks to God, her sales are doing well. She buys her merchandise from authorized distributors in the area where she works. Victoria says that although she only makes a little selling shoes, it helps, so she has kept with her business.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to help her stock some more items for orders she has pending with customers, who she lets pay in installments so that it is not such a burden on them. Viki, as her loved ones call her, says that she really likes working with VisionFund because the repayments are not burdensome, so she has time to get the money together through sales to her customers.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are named Rosalinda, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, and Dora Elia. They will invest in the purchase of feed for rabbits and turkeys, and to purchase natural beauty products, handmade embroidery pieces, and cosmetics for catalog sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":1342583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to sell shoes and bedspreads by catalog","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-05-18T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-17T23:50:04Z","loan_amount":3125,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Elia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2585.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2881.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3009.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3075.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3142.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3211.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3282.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3354.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3428.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3503.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3580.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":294.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":694.94,"local_amount":8450.51,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8461.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373049003,"comment":null},{"amount":500.96,"local_amount":6091.66,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6099.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840172,"comment":null},{"amount":254.64,"local_amount":3096.42,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3100.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698524,"comment":null},{"amount":264.14,"local_amount":3211.88,"processed_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3216.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698525,"comment":null},{"amount":550.9,"local_amount":6698.95,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6707.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944797,"comment":null},{"amount":570.74,"local_amount":6940.17,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6949.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227879,"comment":null},{"amount":288.68,"local_amount":3510.41,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3515.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991745,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-19T23:05:22Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559965,"name":"Rosie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosie is 44 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by fattening pigs in the Philippines.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Zakaria is an artisan. He works on private orders on constructions and earns small monthly salary, which is rarely enough for the food for family. Family also has pigs. Pigs will be sold at the local market at a good price and Zakaria will earn additional income.\n\nZakaria requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Zakaria has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Zakaria will start a car washing business. He will purchase essential equipment, and a vacuum cleaner. Zakaria will provide services to his local community members, and hopes to increase the monthly income of the family.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines against the invading Japanese.  Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.  Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She also says hope is the driving factor to be successful in life. She is single and lives with her mother, brother and her sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nKimneichong runs a tea shop-<i>cum<\/i>-variety shop in the village where she lives. Her shop is located near her house. She sells a few essential commodities including candles, kerosene, salt, sugar, cereals, matchsticks, cigarettes (exported and local), betel nuts, betel leaves, shampoo sachets, etc. Her tea shop is busy \u2013 especially in the mornings when village elders throng in for chit-chat and to enjoy tea. She also prepares toast and puri in the morning. She wanted to help her brother and sister-in-law with the farm but opted for opening a tea shop and running a variety shop instead because her mother is old now. She manages the household chores and also takes care of her aged mother, so she is better off running the shop because she can stay close to her mother. She gets supplies from the city and sells them in the village at a little higher rate to make a profit. She also supports the family in household financial maintenance.\r\n\r\nHer inception in the group enabled her to join a local investment group where one deposits a monthly saving and the amount can be withdrawn after the completion of a year. Her savings so far are small and she hopes to make larger savings once she can expand her shop by refilling with more stock. With this Kiva loan, she will purchase detergent soaps, detergent powder, rice and edible oils. Her future plan is to be able to run the shop without needing a loan, and she says she will work hard to achieve her plan. She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the support and enabling her to look forward to her plans.

It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTeimuraz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Teimuraz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Teimuraz will start sunflower production. He will purchase all the needed equipment and raw materials and will start packing bags. He will sell the produced sunflowers at local markets at a good price. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

lives in the Nkubu area of Kenya, which hosts a campus of Mt. Kenya University. She has 6 children and has been supporting them for 14 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, crops, transportation services, and a personal farming. The photo was taken from her residential house and not from the farm.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is selling milk. Her biggest challenge is crop failure and poor prices for farm produce. Animals on her farm have been given the name of Kageni. Josephine is requesting a loan to construct a zero grazing unit.\r\n\r\nJosephine chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they are the best financier for farmers. Josephine learned about the importance of savings during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees, and the increase in sales from this loan will allow her to pay the school fees.\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Josephine owns a cow, pig, poultry, and a motorcycle but does not own a pump, bicycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, electricity, running water, TV, and DVD but does not have solar power or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

Customers always prefer Reyes' products as they are of good quality and sold at accessible prices; you also can't beat the customer service.  Reyes is dedicated to his work and wants to take advantage of the boom in his business to increase production and thus earn higher profits.

Our interviewee, Carolina, is located in the middle of the photo wearing a black jacket and smiling. She is next to a man in a yellow cap. She has a business selling new clothes. She travels to Santiago to buy in bulk. She began her business in a very particular way: when she was 17 years old, her father loaned her $1,000 and she traveled with her brother to Santiago to explore the city. She bought some things in the Patronato neighborhood and when she got home, she sold them all. This is how she began to go to Santiago and buy clothes to order. When she was 19, she stopped working because of the birth of her son. But, last year she began to sell clothes again. She tells us that the bad thing about this business is when she sells clothes to people that don't pay. This has been one of her biggest problems. So, when she came back to selling clothes, she decided to only buy for the people who place orders and pay without problems. In this local cycle, things are going very well as she has assured the sale of the clothes she buys. She adds that, what she has most liked about working with Fondo Esperanza is the fact that they give her advice and counsel and the security that they offer as an institution. \r\n
