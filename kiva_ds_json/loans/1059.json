They have their own home in a farm outbuilding.  She is cheerful and charismatic, qualities which make her work more bearable.  Her main business is agriculture and she has ten years' experience of growing peas, beans, potatoes, corn and vegetables.  \"My land is quite a distance away, so it takes me about half an hour to get there\" she observes.  In spite of this, every morning, Luzmila, with her customary perseverance, goes very happily to tend her crops, with the help of her husband and farm labourers who help at harvest time.  While this is going on, she goes to sell her produce at the wholesale market in Tarma.  Over the last year, her children have made more demands on her for school-related materials and so Luzmila has turned to her communal bank to cover her main needs.  This month is important as she has to do some planting and spread fertiliser on some crops, as well as having to begin sowing.  She is a member of the \"Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay\" communal bank and this would be her sixth loan with MFP.  So strongly does Luzmila feel part of the bank that she has become its treasurer and, for that reason, she guarantees that she will make her repayments punctually.  She will spend the 1500 soles on seeds and fertiliser to begin growing corn, oats and peas.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1296856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and fertiliser","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-18T16:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-20T16:30:19Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863838,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T18:32:07Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":528453,"name":"Binta","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Binta  est une r\u00e9sidente d e l\u2019une des localit\u00e9s villageoises du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

The family has a poultry farm as well and sells chickens. Nugzar works hard to do his best for the family.\n\nHe requested a loan to expand his poultry farm.

is a 47-year-old Lebanese single woman. She is living on her own. \r\n\r\nNawale has been working as a private teacher since 2010. She likes her profession because she feels that she is helping learners to get the needed education. She started teaching from home until she decided to apply for a loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l. to arrange a special teaching room and equip it with the needed supplies. \r\n\r\nNawale notes that these purchases will facilitate her work preparation, allowing her to expand her research and studies.

is 23 years old and lives in the town of Seeta in the Mukono region of Uganda. For the past 3 years, Christine has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soap, bread, milk, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Christine has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities such as milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Christine to generate greater profits, support her family's basic needs and save some money for future use. Christine hopes that in the future she will be able to become a powerful business woman. \r\n\r\nChristine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nNote: More than 70 percent of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal) and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seeds and fertilizers. This enables a borrower to grow more crops to be sold in the local market, allowing households to move beyond subsistence. This loan will provide much-needed cash income throughout the

","en":"Begayim is the 49-year-old mother of four children.  Two of these four children are grown.  Begayim has received a higher education, and is, by nature, a quiet, decent, and courteous woman.  She has been a source of income for her family for 30 years, earning money through her livestock.  She began her business with 10,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work perseverance, she now brings in around 20,000 KGS a month, and has one cow and eight ewes.    Additionally, Begayim cultivates four hectares of land, growing corn, cotton, and vegetables.

They come from Sauce in the northern part of the country, a place characterized by milk, junket and cheese production. \r\n\r\nThese people are hardworking, responsible and enthusiastic about self-improvement. Regrettably, due to a lack of economic resources, none of them could finish their studies as they were obliged to work from an early age. This is a situation they don't want for their children, so they fight to offer them better opportunities. \r\n\r\nThanks to her spirit and desire to succeed, the coordinator of the 'Bello Amanecer' communal bank is Juana Guillermina. She works in a pulper\u00eda [grocery store] located in her home. A pulper\u00eda is a small shop that sells grocery products in small quantities like sachets of shampoo, packets of coffee, bread, eggs, beans, sugar, milk, rice, oil, and tiste [a soft drink made from toasted cornflour]. It's an activity that she very much enjoys doing since it has been her way of life and that of her family. \r\n\r\nJuana's work routine is to work about 12 hours offering products in her grocery store.

Su prop\u00f3sito, es conseguir m\u00e1s ingresos para mejorar su vivienda; ya que una parte es de adobe y la otra de madera; entonces desea cerrarla completamente de adobe, ya que en invierno se moja dentro de la casa.  Entre sus sue\u00f1os, est\u00e1 construir su casa de bloque con cuatro habitaciones separadas, ya que la que tiene est\u00e1 dividida por carpetas pl\u00e1sticas y cart\u00f3n y es de adobe con madera.

He\u2019s worked in agriculture since he was a boy having learned from his father who grew corn, beans and sorghum; he's currently betting on banana growing.

In order to buy his farm supplies he travels to a city that\u2019s 5.3 kilometers away from his house, a trip he makes in public transportation.  He sells his harvests to local residents and in the municipal market.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to increase banana production and to provide proper fertilization to take advantage of part of the land he has available that\u2019s fertile and apt for growing bananas.  His goal is to earn more income to do some home improvements because part of it is adobe and part is wood and he\u2019d like it to be completely adobe because the interior gets wet in winter.\r\n\r\nAmong his dreams is to build a brick house with four separate bedrooms since his current house is divided by plastic sheets and cardboard and it\u2019s made of adobe and wood.  He also wants to plant 14,000 square meters of bananas; he currently only plants 7,000 square meters.

is a widow, aged 40, and from Sanga village in the Kiruhura district. Her husband died ten years ago in a bus accident, which claimed many lives along the Kampala highway. After her husband\u2019s death, life became miserable to the extent that Doreen could not afford tuition for her fatherless children. The situation worsened when her father-in-law tried to marry her and when she refused, he took all the cows her husband left her with.

Three of the children are currently enrolled in school, and all but one still live in with the family. \n\nThe family manages a small farm of an acre and a half, with around 600 cacao trees. Luciano started to plant some years ago encouraged by the local cooperative, the market opportunity for cacao and his brothers\u2019 advice to start cultivating the crop. It was a great decision, he says, because cacao is \u201cthe number one cash crop.\u201d He\u2019s excited about cacao not only for its stable income-generating potential but also because it is a long-term crop that continues to produce pods for decades after it is planted. Luciano\u2019s favorite part of cacao farming is seeing the field clean: \u201cit looks really good!\u201d The cleaning itself, however, is less fun because it requires hard work and takes up a lot of time. Cacao grows in the middle of lush jungle, meaning the farmers have to constantly fight underbrush growth to keep the trees healthy and accessible. \n\nBesides growing cacao, Luciano cultivates corn among other crops for home use. He is also currently in the Belize Defense Force, which he hopes he can retire from in two years to then fully focus on his farm. In the next few years, the family hopes to renovate their home to better accommodate the growing family. Luciano says the family plans to support the children in achieving the furthest education levels they have reason to want to pursue, but will also extend a helping hand if they instead choose to go into farming. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan for cleaning their 600 cacao trees as well as bagging 500 seeds and lining the land for a planned expansion. Once bagged, cacao seeds take about six months to grow into a seedling that is ready for transplantation into the ground. Lining is the process of planning and marking the spots where seedlings will be planted to ensure a linear structure and sufficient spacing. The loan will pay for the equivalent of 30 days of hired labor in the community. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":363.93,"image":{"id":1297183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean and expand cacao farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":86.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971168,"comment":null},{"amount":93.88,"local_amount":178.81,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":186.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751693,"comment":null},{"amount":43.78,"local_amount":83.39,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993434,"comment":null},{"amount":43.79,"local_amount":83.4,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255603,"comment":null},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":82.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":86.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136444,"comment":null},{"amount":51.35,"local_amount":97.8,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":102.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900661,"comment":null},{"amount":43.82,"local_amount":83.47,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":87.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088542,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T04:27:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529078,"name":"Casamiro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Casamiro, age 45, lives in the village of San Jose, in the foothills of the Maya Mountains.

Seedlings are typically strong enough for transplantation when they have four leaves, and take about six months to grow to that stage. The tasks at hand will require and create the equivalent of 18 days of labor in the community. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":296.25,"image":{"id":1297187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean cacao and establish a centralized nursery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Casamiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":58.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":62.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098950,"comment":null},{"amount":57.18,"local_amount":106.74,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":113.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971169,"comment":null},{"amount":31.38,"local_amount":58.58,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":62.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751694,"comment":null},{"amount":25.51,"local_amount":47.62,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993435,"comment":null},{"amount":31.35,"local_amount":58.52,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":62.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255604,"comment":null},{"amount":31.36,"local_amount":58.53,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":62.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136445,"comment":null},{"amount":31.35,"local_amount":58.52,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":62.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900662,"comment":null},{"amount":25.55,"local_amount":47.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088543,"comment":null},{"amount":31.32,"local_amount":58.47,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":62.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202041,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T04:02:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529081,"name":"Isidoro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isidoro, age 58,  lives in the village of San Jose, where he has been farming cacao for over 30 years.

The challenging part of cacao for him is the birds, as they damage ripe pods and create production loss. \n The family is requesting this loan to hire help clean their cacao farm. Cleaning is the removal of the overgrown bush in the cacao farm and its surroundings to make it accessible for pruning and harvesting. Part of the loan will also be used for hiring people from the village to help with harvesting.

She received a higher education and, by character, she's respectable and has integrity.  She works with livestock as a source of income for her family.  She began her business in 2003 with 20,000 KGS.  In her care, the business has grown and she now earns around 10,000 KGS a month from reselling cattle.  To date, Damira has two milk cows and ten goats.  The income from her business allows her to pay tuition for the education her sons receive in university.  With the goal of further developing her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a sum of 60,000 KGS to buy twelve sheep.

was born in 1973 at Kabwooma \u2013 Nyakagyeme, Rukungiri from a peasantry family. When his parents passed on, he carried on with the parents\u2019 agriculture business of banana planting and livestock to earn a living and support his siblings. Livingstone and his wife have a family of four (4) children of which three attend school.\r\n\r\nLivingstone started a salon business in 2010 which serves ladies only at the moment. The business went on getting clients and reached a time when the resources were not enough to serve their clients.

Neli","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fany es una mujer de 34 a\u00f1os, creci\u00f3 en un hogar del campo con escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos, pero en el cual sus padres le apoyaron para estudiar la escuela primaria, conocimientos con los cuales  ha trabajado a lo largo de su vida, decidi\u00f3 salir de su casa para vivir con su pareja Alfredo con quien tiene 3 hijos de 10 a\u00f1os el mayor, 7 a\u00f1os el segundo que est\u00e1n estudiando en una escuela p\u00fablica y la m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a de 7 meses.  Una familia agricultora que viven en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, su nombre es Nanegalito, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Un medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos a pesar de que fue una zona que en el pasado no fue muy tomada en cuenta.\nFany desde hace un a\u00f1o se dedica a la crianza de pollos y gallinas para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n y adem\u00e1s la producci\u00f3n de huevos. Fany no se dej\u00f3 vencer de los obst\u00e1culos a pesar de que en un emprendimiento anterior, tuvo una p\u00e9rdida muy significativa de recursos econ\u00f3micos. Ahora paralelamente a los quehaceres de su hogar se dedica 8 horas cada d\u00eda a alimentar sus animales, limpiar los criaderos, vender los pollos, etc. A Fany le es muy dif\u00edcil conseguir recursos cuando se ha quedado sin alimento para sus aves y para no sufrir este temor ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de balanceado al por mayor para as\u00ed suplir las necesidades alimenticias de sus aves por algunos meses y adem\u00e1s comprar m\u00e1s aves que le permitan incrementar su negocio y sus clientes. Fany sue\u00f1a con tener junto a su familia una calidad de vida superior a la que ella tuvo y que sus hijos puedan educarse hasta conseguir una profesi\u00f3n que los lleve lejos. Esta mujer sin duda esforzada, agradece a todos quienes alrededor del mundo aportan con un granito de arena para su crecimiento personal y por supuesto agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa que con el apoyo de Kiva le ha podido brindar la facilidad de obtener este capital. ","en":"Fany, 34, grew up in a country home with scarce economic resources, but with the help of her parents she was able to get an elementary education which has helped her through work all her life.  She moved away from home with her common-law husband, Alfredo, and they have three children, a 10-year-old, a 7-year-old and a baby girl, 7 months old.  They are a farming family and live in a rural community called Nanegalito in Quito, Ecuador.  The town is located northwest of the province of Pichincha, the residence of an Ecuadorean culture.  It is a place with a diversity of flora and fauna and pristine rivers and waterfalls that attract national and foreign tourists.  One of the main business activities in the area is farming, including milk and meat production, as well as crop farming of sugar cane, yucca plant, corn, oranges, tangerines and papayas.  Artisan handicrafts are also important here and in much demand because of their natural materials such as forest seeds.  All of this has motivated the local authorities to install adequate facilities so the more than 3,000 inhabitants can have access to basic services despite the fact that the area was never given consideration in the past.\r\n\r\nFor a year now, Fany has been raising chickens and hens that she later sells, along with eggs.  Fany never has let obstacles get in her way, despite the fact that in her pervious business she suffered a significant economic loss.  Now, in addition to her household chores, she spends eight hours a day feeding the animals, cleaning their pens, selling chicken, etc.  \r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for Fany to obtain resources when she runs out of animal feed, so in order not to run the risk she is requesting a loan to buy wholesale balanced feed to have enough on hand for a few months.  She will also buy more chicken to increase business and her customer base.  \r\n\r\nFany's goal is to give her family a better quality of life than her own.  She wants her children to get an education so they can become successful professionals.  This hard-working woman is grateful to people around the world who contribute toward her personal growth.  Of course, she is algo grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa which, with Kiva's support, has made the loan possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1297078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nanegalito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T09:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T09:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fany Neli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":747.04,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":59.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":61.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.29,"local_amount":50.09,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068721,"comment":null},{"amount":57.49,"local_amount":57.26,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":57.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524912,"comment":null},{"amount":59.02,"local_amount":58.79,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":59.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133216,"comment":null},{"amount":59.77,"local_amount":59.54,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313754,"comment":null},{"amount":61.3,"local_amount":61.05,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":61.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565361,"comment":null},{"amount":62.16,"local_amount":61.92,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":62.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814402,"comment":null},{"amount":399.97,"local_amount":398.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":399.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320578,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T13:08:48Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529074,"name":"Los Vecinos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento LOS VECINOS est\u00e1 compuesto por nueve integrantes, todas mujeres, la presidenta del banco es La Sra.

This project has been a profitable one and the only source of income for the family, but from time to time it needs more support to cover the cost.\r\n\r\nAmneh is requesting a USD Murabaha loan to help her husband cover the cost of purchasing more types of herbs.\r\nThis will increase sales and increase the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is Susan, 47, a resident of Cabrera, Pasay City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nSusan operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSusan hopes to have more customers and dreams of giving her children a good life.  She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1119928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"  To pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken and vegetables and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T13:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T13:30:24Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2032.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037397,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.99,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2710.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781914,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2709.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488803,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2710.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894431,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T14:01:17Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529129,"name":"Clarisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clarisa is 21 years old.

The one difficulty which Bonaventure foresees could cause non-repayment of this loan is climate change, which can cause a poor harvest. In order to increase his agricultural output, his strategy is to use modern farming methods, notably by using chemical fertilizers and going to look for markets for his harvest.

She looks forward to this financial improvement with a glad and thankful heart.\r\n\r\nDionafe dreams of expanding her business and generating more income.

On her farm today, Urnisa has six sheep, five cows, one horse and ten beehives, all of which bring in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month through the sale of livestock and honey.  With the goal of developing her business further, Ulrisa turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow and sugar for her bees.  She plans to reinvest the income from this loan into developing her business further."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1898.65,"image":{"id":1296724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She takes great care of her old sewing machine and considers it her loyal companion. She takes good care of her clients, which has helped her to provide an excellent quality.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCarmelita is a mineral water distributor. What she basically does is buy mineral water in containers from wholesalers, then sells them individually (5 gallons per container) at a profit. She also sells rice for additional income. Her regular customers for her mineral water are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more gallons of mineral water to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCarmelita hopes that she will be successful in her businesses and dreams they will have their own lot. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

lives peacefully in Libag Sur with her spouse and children. She runs a small store and a hog raising business for income. From her store, she gains about 7,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) each month. The money goes to school fees, daily meals, bills at home, and also feed for her hogs. She was very determined in achieving good sales; that is why she is now asking for a loan of 25,000 PHP to buy canned goods, noodles, eggs, biscuits, sugar, coffee, and bread to sell in her store.

His biggest challenge, he says, is that he lacks funds to diversify his agriculture ventures. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Browny and Nyeusi.\r\n\r\nJoseph was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied that he heard about Juhudi from a relative. This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. He learned 'how one can use microfinance loans to do business, especially agri-business.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Joseph replied, 'I will start poultry keeping with the intent of producing and selling eggs, thus increasing income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Joseph owns a cow but does not own poultry, a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household mosquito netting but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

","en":"Abdukayum is 35 years old and is married with two children.  His children are still in school and his wife works in a cafeteria as a dishwasher.  Abdukayum works in the building trade, but everything that he and his wife earn together goes to pay for their living expenses.  A few months ago, they started to build a home, but they had to halt construction due to lack of funds.  The one solid source of income in the family is cattle raising.  Abdukayum has been involved in this line of work practically since childhood.  He knows all the advantages of this line of work.  His plan is to increase his business so he can use the income to finally finish the work on his home.  His wife also helps him in this task.  At the moment, the feed for the animals is running out since it is winter, there is hardly any grass anywhere.  This is why Abdukayum has turned to Arvand for financial support.  He plans to use his loan to buy feed for his animals.  He sends his thanks to Arvand, because it is through the assistance of their organization that people in need of financial help can fulfill their plans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":382.74,"image":{"id":1293731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also has a food stall for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 16,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nCristita hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams that her business will grow bigger.
