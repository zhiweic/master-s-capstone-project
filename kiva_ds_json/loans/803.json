She is also a kind and sociable person who knows how to win the appreciation of the people with her charisma.  She lives with Manuel who is retired and the father of her 3 children, Niki, Ray and Jaqueline, at 19, 17 and 15 years of age respectively.  Together they live in their own house that they built with their efforts.  The activity that Zoila performs is dressmaking, an occupation that she learned by studying at a center for youth employment education, but which she did not at first pursue.  More than 10 years ago she took up dressmaking again.  Starting with one machine, she currently relies on more than 6 sewing machines for different finishes, offering quality work to her clients that leave satisfied and recommend her to other people.  She also sells clothes that she buys in the capital or that she makes, having in her business a space where she exhibits her products.  She carries out her work in her house, where her clients come and she attends them kindly.  She considers her business quite profitable due to the profits that she earns and the demand for her products.  Up to now she has worked alone, except from time to time when she supports her daughter who is learning to sew.  She decided to begin with this activity when she lost her job and needed a position to generate an income, besides which her neighbors requested her work when they saw her fine finished clothing.  Her age begins to cause her to tire when she is sewing in the same position all day, therefore she wants to invest the profits in a convenience store.  This will be her 16th loan with MFP.  She hopes for a small loan so that she can pursue her objectives.  On the other hand, she tells us that she is comfortable with her communal bank where she knows the members and considers them to be supportive and good people.  With the requested total of 1500 new soles she will invest in dressmaking materials such as fabric, thread, elastic and other such things.  She plans to purchase all these materials at a better price by buying in bulk.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1008530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy dressmaking supplies such as fabric, thread, and elastic.

She considers her business profitable because of the profits that it earns which allow her to settle her expenses and pay for the education of her son.

She is married to Noah who is a teacher and the father of her children, Alex, Carlos and Luis, ages 32, 30 and 28 respectively.  Together they live in their own house that they bought with their savings of many years.  The activity that Dora carries out is renting rooms and houses.  She has  land where she built two houses, one which is rented and the other with small rooms to rent, all occupied.  Her business was started 3 years ago with capital from her own savings, that she invested in their house thinking about their future including the support of their children that help her with the administration.  She considers it a quite profitable business due to the demand and that all her room s are occupied, and that it is work that does not need a lot of physical effort.  She decided to begin her business seeing that she was getting advanced in age and had the need to earn her own income to live on since she would not have access to employment or retirement.  Seeing the opportunity for the business, and the profits that it is achieving she is encouraged to invest in the purchase of more land to build a tourist hotel in the future.  This will be her 12th loan with MFP.  She is grateful to know that she can continue to count on financial support to advance with her business.  Besides she tells us that she is comfortable with her communal bank where she knows its members and considers them to be kind and responsible people.  With the requested total of 2000 new soles she will invest in the purchase of a pump for water valued at 1500 new soles to offer good service to her boarders so they will have permanent water service.  With the balance she will pay for the expenses of installation.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1008539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to install a well to have water all the time for her boarders.

She also sells carbonated beverages and bottled water.  For this she relies on a refrigerator where she keeps all her products well chilled to the tastes of her clients.  She began selling fruits with her own capital, starting small, then stepping up to snacks and at present to carbonated beverages. She attends both businesses in her house.  \r\nShe considers her business quite profitable due to the profits that it earns.

She sells a lot and she always has sales. This allows her to have improved income and thereby improve her quality of life. She now wants to expand her business and start to sell original parts and for different brands and models of vehicles. This will be her 15th loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, so she hopes for collaboration so she can continue with her goals. She also pledges again to make her repayments, as she did with the previous loans she\u2019s had. Also, she is happy to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are people who are responsible and supportive. With the requested amount of 3,000 soles (PEN), she will buy more merchandise to sell, including tires, inner tubes, motor oils, accessories, and other items. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1009184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy tires, inner tubes, motor oils, and accessories.

She is married and her husband is working in another city.  Right now she lives alone but she works hard because she would like to enjoy a better future in her old age.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's business is selling cooked food in a well-known market in the city.  She started this business in partnership with two of her daughters.  Before this she used to sell groceries from her daughter's house but it was not successful.  She has been in this business for six months now and she is putting all her drive and enthusiasm into making progress in it.  During the time that she has been carrying out this work, there are things that continue seeming strange to her and others that fill her with excitement.  She hopes to be able to grow the business together with her daughters and she feels that they are on the right path because they have been attracting many customers over recent months.  She still remembers six months ago when she started out in her new business, how she was full of doubts but also a lot of determination and hope.  All her efforts have paid off and now she is thinking of expanding her sales location so that she can make more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mar\u00eda's fourth loan from MFP.  She has always been a very good member of her community bank where she is very well liked because she is responsible and supportive.

She lives with her partner Luis who is a salesman and the father of her three children Jouliet, Luis and Luciano, who are 7, 5 and 1 and who she loves very much.  They live comfortably together in a rental house together with her sister and her nephew.\r\n\r\nAna's business is selling regional fruit and different flavored drinks.  Every day she sets up a table in front of her home where she places her fruit and drinks and then offers them for sale.  Her business is popular thanks to her kind manner and the good flavor of her drinks.  Ana started this business more than two years ago with a loan from MFP and, up to now, she has been working alone.  However, her sister sometimes supports her.  She considers her business to be fairly profitable because of the income it makes her and how popular it is.  She decided to start this business because she needed work which would allow her to make her own income.  Sometimes her partner's income wasn't enough and so she took the decision to help him with their household expenses so that they could provide their children with a better quality of life.  Now that she sees the good results she is having, she would like to continue in her business and also start selling groceries.  She would like to open a store in her home for this.\r\n\r\nThis will be Ana's third loan from MFP.  She feels grateful for the financial support that she receives as it makes her feel more secure in making progress with her plans.  She also comments that she feels happy with her community bank as she considers its members to be cooperative and responsible.  Ana will invest the 1,000 soles she has requested in buying soda to stock her business.  She will also buy a variety of fruit, seeking out affordable prices for her purchases so that she makes more profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1009351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy soda and fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T11:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T11:30:07Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":146.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":160.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":159.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":172.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":182.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.12,"local_amount":306.99,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":308.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099746,"comment":null},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":159.69,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":160.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713877,"comment":null},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":172.24,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":173.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202773,"comment":null},{"amount":66.99,"local_amount":178.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":179.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098449,"comment":null},{"amount":68.41,"local_amount":182.42,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":183.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-08T10:50:19Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393512,"name":"Teymur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teymur is forty-seven years old and married with two children.

She lives with her two youngest daughters, ages 12 and 16. The oldest is independent and lives with her own family. She lives with her partner in their own home. She wants to provide her daughters with a better quality of life and offer them a good education. \r\n\r\nThe work that Nimia does is very complex. Her two occupations are selling fast food and ice-cold drinks. She has to get up early in the morning to seek out the largest, freshest chickens at the best prices. Then she prepares everything so that in the evening, she can sell along the path at her house with the help of her two daughters. She has worked in this business for over two years, and she likes it a lot because she can do her work alongside her daughters. She has taught her daughters from an early age to value responsibility without neglecting their studies. She feels that the business is worthwhile since she sells at least five chickens a day, generating a good income. When she started with the work, it was a little complicated since she did not know much yet. Before, she used to sell groceries. But with determination and energy, she was able to learn. Now she has one of the most exquisite fast foods in the city. One of the things that she would like to achieve is to grow her business and make it larger every day. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP, so she hopes that though this collaboration she will be able to continue towards her goals. She commits once again to making her loan payments, just as she did with her previous loans. In addition, she is thankful to be a part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and united. With the 600 Nuevos Soles (PEN), she will purchase ingredients and food to be able to continue with her work. She will also change some of the utensils she uses in her work. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1009265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase ingredients, chicken, and kitchen utensils.

She lives with her partner Rivert who is a manual laborer and the father of her only daughter, 5-year-old Rosa.  They live comfortably together in their own home which they worked very hard to buy.  \r\n\r\nIsabel's business is selling costume jewelry and providing manicures.  She carries out these activities from home where she has the materials and accessories she needs.  She provides a good service to her customers.  She learned these trades through experience, watching her friends.  She also has a motorcycle taxi that she hires out to make more income.  She started out two years ago with a loan from MFP.  She bought her materials in small quantities then, seeing that the demand for her services and products was increasing, she increased her purchases.  Up to now she has worked alone.  Isabel considers her business to be profitable because of the income it makes her and how much demand she has for her services owing to her good work.  She decided to start her own business because she wanted to have her own income and support her partner, joining efforts so that they could make progress and provide for their family.  Given the good results that she is experiencing, in the future she would like to open a beauty salon in her home so that she can serve her customers comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis will be Isabel's fifth loan from MFP.  She feels grateful and happy to know that she will have the financial support she needs to carry out her plans.  She says that she feels happy with her community bank because of the good work they do supporting people.

She is also cheerful and kind to others.  She is married to Javier who is a teacher and the father of her children: 22-year-old Luis, 18-year-old Marvin and 8-year-old Karen.  They live comfortably together in their own home that Doylibeth bought with the support of her husband.\r\n\r\nDoylibeth's business is making and knitting clothing, tablecloths and bedspreads.  She learned this skill from her grandmother when she was very young.  She makes her items at home and sells them to her friends and family members, providing them with good customer service and thereby gaining their loyalty.  She also sells clothing, that her daughter sends her from the capital, at affordable prices.  Up to now she has been working alone but her children sometimes support her in collecting payment for her items.  She considers her business to be fairly profitable owing to the demand that she has for her products and the speed of her capital turnover.  This allows her to see her profits very quickly.  She decided to start her business because she needed an income to cover her expenses and pay for her children's education as her husband's salary wasn't enough to meet their increasing expenses.  Seeing the good results that she has experienced, she would now like to start another business, opening a grocery store in her home.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Doylibeth's fifth loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive a small loan so that she can achieve her goals.  She enjoys belonging to her community bank because all the members are responsible and very supportive people.  She will invest the 1,800 soles she has requested in buying clothing to sell.  She will buy at low prices because she will buy in bulk.  She will also buy materials with which to repair to house, creating an environment in which she can set up her grocery store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1009375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more clothing and also materials for repairing her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T11:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T11:50:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doyliveth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":260.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":287.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":298.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":300.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":320.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":331.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":205.69,"local_amount":548.51,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":551.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099749,"comment":null},{"amount":111.9,"local_amount":298.4,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":300.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713880,"comment":null},{"amount":112.68,"local_amount":300.47,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":302.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202776,"comment":null},{"amount":120.28,"local_amount":320.74,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":322.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098452,"comment":null},{"amount":124.45,"local_amount":331.88,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":333.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401245,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T18:09:15Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393522,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is a businessman and married with one child.

She is also friendly and kind to others.  She lives together with Denis who is a manual worker and the father of her two children Renzo and Sofia who are 4 and 1.  They live comfortably together in their own home that they worked hard to buy.\r\n\r\nMayja's business is selling food in the afternoons such as 'juanes' (a traditional chicken dish) and '<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Papa_rellena\">papas rellenas<\/a>'.  She prepares the food in her home and makes her sales as an itinerant vendor, walking with a tray through the sawmills near her home.  She started off selling 'mazamorras moradas' (a traditional pudding made from purple corn) and managed to increase her capital.  She then increased her business and started selling 'juanes' instead.  This was popular and she sold everything that she made.  Up to now she has worked alone.\r\n\r\nMayja considers her business to be fairly profitable because of the profits she makes and because she manages to sell everything she prepares.  She decided to start this business because she needed an additional income with which to support her partner as his income wasn't enough to cover their household expenses.  Seeing the good results that she has had, she would like to open a restaurant business in the future because she enjoys cooking.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mayja's fourth loan from MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have financial support as she makes progress in her business.  She is happy with her community bank because she knows the members and she believes them to be responsible and supportive people.  Mayja will invest the 1,300 soles she has requested in buying the ingredients she needs for preparing her food.  This will mean she will have what she needs to hand and she hopes to buy at low prices because she will be buying in bulk."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1009376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy products and ingredients for making food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T12:10:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayja ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":190.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208.4},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":207.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":223.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":232.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":237.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":153.5,"local_amount":399.1,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":411.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099750,"comment":null},{"amount":79.85,"local_amount":207.61,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":214.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713881,"comment":null},{"amount":86.12,"local_amount":223.92,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":230.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202777,"comment":null},{"amount":89.34,"local_amount":232.27,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":239.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098453,"comment":null},{"amount":91.19,"local_amount":237.1,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":244.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401246,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T02:13:04Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394214,"name":"Diana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Diana, de 31 a\u00f1os es una madre pujante y trabajadora, tiene un hijo de cinco a\u00f1os, esta casada y vive con su hijo y su esposo en una casa propia, ella tiene el gusto de poder brindar eduaci\u00f3n y buenos h\u00e1bitos a su menor hijos a quien desea brindarle una mejor calidad de vida.

She has a 5-year-old son, is married and lives with her son and husband in their own house.  She likes to be able to teach manners and good habits to her young son who she hopes to be able to provide with a better quality of life. Diana\u2019s work starts in the morning when she does her domestic chores. From there she prepares to go visit her friends, colleagues, and relatives offering them shoes and new clothing of good quality and with excellent designs. The products that she sells are sent to her from the city of Lima for sale in our city. She has to work alone, since her husband drives a motorcycle taxi that they bought with the previous loan. She has been doing this work for 3 years, and it is going very well.\r\nWhat she most likes about her work is that together with her husband, they have one more source of income. This is because apart from this business, she is also a teacher in an educational institution. However, her teacher\u2019s salary is often not enough, so she does this business to generate extra income. She has future plans to be able to buy sandals and lingerie to increase her sales. This will be her fourth loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support to be able to continue increasing her working capital.

He is the father of her three children who are 14, 7 and 3 and who she loves very much.  They live together comfortably in their own home which they worked very hard to build.\r\n\r\nHilma's business is selling ladies' beauty products such as make-up, hair dyes, nail polish, lipsticks, perfumes, etc.  All of these products are bought through a catalog and sold from her home to family members, friends and neighbors.  She also provides home delivery.  Her business stands out because of the kind and friendly way in which she deals with her customers who end up satisfied and then recommend her to other people who, over time, become regular customers.  Hilma started this business more than four years ago and, up to now, she has worked alone both in selling her products and in collecting payment for them.\r\n\r\nHilma considers her business to be fairly profitable because of the good profits she makes and the regular customers that she has managed to attract.  She didn't have any financial problems before she started her business but she decided to take the plunge and start her own business so that she would have something to keep her busy in her free time, which would make her feel like a successful, independent businesswoman.  Seeing the good results she has experienced, Hilma now hopes to increase her stock and grow her business.\r\n\r\nThis will be Hilma's seventh loan from MFP.

She lives with her partner, Juan, who works in transportation and is the father of their two children, ages 7 and 1. They live together in their own house, which they bought with great effort. Patricia's business is the sale of fruit and soft drinks. To do this, she sets up a table every morning in front of her house, where she cordially serves her customers, who are her neighbors, earning their friendship.\r\n\r\nShe began more than two years ago with some capital of her own, and up until now she has had the help of her sister in serving customers. She feels that her business is fairly profitable because of the earnings that it gives her and the demand for her products.\r\n\r\nShe decided to begin her business because of the need to have an income to assist her partner with the household expenses and thus be able to offer a better quality of life to their children, whom she loves very much.\r\n\r\nTherefore, and seeing the good results she is having with her business, she wants to continue and maintain her business.

She lives with 33-year-old Arturo, with whom she has two children, 5-year-old Liz and her younger newborn, Brenda. She lives in her own house, where she raises her daughters and hopes to provide them with a better quality of life. Marlene's work consists of selling fruit. Every day she goes to the market in her city to look for the freshest and most nutritious fruits. She buys wholesale and from there goes to her house, where she has a stand to offer her products for sale. Besides being the only person who offers this variety of fruits, she also has a nice, friendly manner. Because of this, her customers come by every day, knowing they will find the fruit they're looking for at a good price. She has been doing this work for approximately two years, and she does it alone.\r\n\r\nAt first, it was very difficult for her to do this work, since having to get up in the early morning was very hard on her. With time, however, she learned to take time in the evenings in order to save herself time in the mornings. It is going very well for her. She has good sales, and that allows her to have good earnings. She hopes to continue working together and progressing, since her home finances are constantly improving. In the future she would like to increase her sales and offer a greater variety of products for sale. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP, so she is hoping for a small loan to enable her to meet her goals. She is committed to once again making her payments in a very timely and responsible manner, as she did with the prior loan that she received. She is very happy to belong to her communal bank since all of the members are very good and supportive people. With the requested amount of 1200 soles, she will buy more fruit and increase the amount a vegetables a bit, allowing her to offer greater variety to her clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1009192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":172.55},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":192.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":199.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":214.1},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":221.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.22},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136.72,"local_amount":364.59,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":366.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099732,"comment":null},{"amount":74.7,"local_amount":199.2,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713864,"comment":null},{"amount":75.22,"local_amount":200.58,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":201.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202759,"comment":null},{"amount":80.29,"local_amount":214.1,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":215.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098437,"comment":null},{"amount":83.07,"local_amount":221.53,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":222.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401230,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-05T18:57:46Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394291,"name":"Carina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carina, de 37 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer trabajadora y empe\u00f1osa, adem\u00e1s de ser alegre y amable tiene muchas ganas de salir adelante.

She has a great desire to get ahead and to triumph in life.  She is married to Carlos, a transportation worker, and he is the father of their six children.  The children are ages 18, 17, 8, and 3 year old triplets.  They live together in a rented house.  She loves them dearly, and they are her motivation to work more as she looks to give them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nElith sells medicine and other health products.  To do this she has a drugstore that she opened in a rented spot in the same place as the house that she rents.  This saves her more rental expenses.  She started her business over one year ago.  Her husband supports her with the money that she needed to buy the necessary merchandise.  There is a health clinic located in front of her business, and many times they do not have the medicines that the patients request.\r\n\r\nShe feels that her business is profitable because of the good income it gives her and the regular clientele that she has.  Before having her business she encountered financial hardships.  Her family grew very rapidly with the arrival of the triplets, and their expenses grew.  Their income was not enough, so they looked at alternative solutions.  They decided on this business.  Now it is going well for them, and they have overcome many of their financial hardships.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they have plans to continue and to make it grow by getting more merchandise in order to have stock available to sell.\r\n\r\nThis will be her seventh loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she can count on a loan to advance with her business.  She pledges to make her payments and to have a good credit record so that she can access more loans in the future.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she is comfortable working with her communal bank because of the support that they give to people who need it.  She will use the requested 2,500 soles to buy pharmacy products like medicine, pills, and others.  She will be looking for the best prices by purchasing in volume.  This way she can sell at lower prices, and she will be helping her customers with their needs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1009410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"to buy medications.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":368.05},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":398.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":413.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":444.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":458.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.86},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":291.38,"local_amount":766.78,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":781.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099757,"comment":null},{"amount":157.17,"local_amount":413.61,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":421.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713888,"comment":null},{"amount":158.26,"local_amount":416.49,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":424.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202784,"comment":null},{"amount":168.94,"local_amount":444.56,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":453.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098458,"comment":null},{"amount":174.25,"local_amount":458.56,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":467.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401253,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-03T19:58:26Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394303,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa, de 50 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer que le gusta el trabajo, tambi\u00e9n es amable y cordial en su trato con las personas.

She also sells beauty products such as nail polish, creams, lipsticks and more. She acquires these by catalog and sells them to friends and to the people who visit her soda fountain.\r\n\r\nShe started more than 6 years ago with a bank loan, selling small quantities. Later she grew her business little by little. So far, she has done it by herself, but at times her daughters visit her and help her serve customers. She considers her business to be very profitable with the earnings it brings her, since it is frequented a lot by her faithful customers. She decided to start her business wanting to have a job and a profession to generate income and not depend completely on her spouse, as well as to be a prosperous businesswoman. Now that she sees the good results, she wants to continue with her business and get into selling appliances. This will be loan number 5 with the MFP institution. She feels grateful knowing that she can count on the financial support to cement her plans. She also feels good with her communal bank because she considers it to be a united and supportive group. \r\n\r\nWith the 2000 nuevos soles, she will invest in buying merchandise to sell such as comforters and sheets, which she will sell with her spouse, hoping to increase her capital and have more earnings.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1009430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy comforters and sheets.

She is also cheerful and sociable. She is separated from the father of her children. She lives comfortably with her two children, who are 25 and 28 years old, in the home of her mother, along with two newphews and their mother, all of whom she loves a great deal. Mar\u00eda's business activity is a printing service where she performs all types of graphical work, providing her customers with a high-quality service that earns her their business.\r\n\r\nShe began 30 years ago with her own capital. She saw that this would be a profitable business, given that there were few people providing this service, so she decided to open a printing business in her house. She obtained the machinery with her own capital, in partnership with her ex-partner. She currently has the support of her brother and his children to attend to the customers. She likes this business because it lets her see her family working together, provides her with income, and allows her to support herself. On the other hand, every day she finds this work more tiring due to her advanced age and a disease that has been affecting her for some time. She knows, however, that she needs to continue, as it is her only source of income. As well, she has plans with her children to expand the business and add a bookstore in the space that she has available in her house, in an attempt to increase her income. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP. Because of this she is hoping for their collaboration so that she can finalize her plans. As well, she says that she feels comfortable with her communal bank because she considers them to be responsible and supportive people. With the requested amount of 1500 nuevos soles (PEN), she will invest in the purchase of materials to expand and prepare the space for the bookstore. With the balance, she will purchase printing materials, such as ink, card stock, and other items. She will be looking for the lowest prices to make her purchases in bulk with cash payment.

She is separated from the father of her children. She lives in her own house with her children, ages 15, 13, and 8, whom she loves a lot and wants to bring up well. Emma's business is the sale of secondhand clothing for women, men, and children. She acquires all these products in the commercial center of the city, and she sells them as a walking vendor, going through the little outlying towns located on the edges of the banks of the rivers. To do this, she travels until she finishes selling all her merchandise, no matter how long it takes. She began this business six years ago, investing some capital of her own, the fruit of her savings, because of the need to have an income to support her children, since the allowance that their father sends them is not sufficient. But now she has managed to increase her capital and she has the help of her son, who accompanies her on her sales.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business profitable because of the good earnings she obtains, since she sells at higher prices in these areas; in addition, she likes to sell and deal with people. For this reason, she plans to continue her business and expand into selling factory-made clothing, and in the future she would like to open a store to sell clothing in the city of Pucallpa, since she gets tired making her trips. This will be her fourth loan with MFP. For this she hopes for your help so that she can realize her plans. In addition, she comments that she feels good about her communal bank because she knows its members and considers them responsible and united people. With the 1800 PEN that she has applied for, she will invest in the purchase of merchandise for her business, such as secondhand women's, men's, and children's clothing. Thus she will have an available stock for sale, and she will seek lower prices by making her purchases in volume.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1009423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more secondhand clothing for women, men, and children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":264.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":288.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":287.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":310.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":321.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":328.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":207.24,"local_amount":552.63,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":555.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099761,"comment":null},{"amount":107.8,"local_amount":287.48,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":289.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713892,"comment":null},{"amount":116.27,"local_amount":310.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":311.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202788,"comment":null},{"amount":243.69,"local_amount":649.84,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":653.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401257,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She has been separated from the father of her children for several years. She lives comfortably in her own house, along with her 24-year-old daughter and with her mother, for whom she provides care due to her advanced age. Maritza's business activity is the sale of all types of soft drinks. To do this, she opened a small location in her own house where she takes very nice care of her customers. She began this business six years ago by purchasing small quantities. Seeing that it was going well, she decided to continue investing by purchasing a larger quantity of merchandise to have stock available for sale, and up until now she has run this business by herself. She considers it profitable based on the good earnings that it provides her. After her separation from the father of her daughter, she had many economic needs, so she decided to start this business six years ago to generate income that could help her. This is how she has managed to help her daughter advance and to pay for her education, this being her greatest pride. In the future she would like to become a beverage distributor, see her business increase, and become a prosperous entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fifth loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support, since that way she can be sure that she'll be able to move her business forward. Additionally, she is committed once again to making her payments, as she did with previous loans that she received. Also, she likes being part of her communal bank because all of the members are very responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 1000 nuevos soles (PEN), she will invest in the purchase of a greater volume of merchandise for her business, which is selling soft drinks. This way she can have stock available for sale, and see her business increase. She will seek the best prices for her bulk purchases, with the goal of increasing her profit margin.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1009437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":146.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":160.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":159.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":172.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":182.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.12,"local_amount":306.99,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":308.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099765,"comment":null},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":159.69,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":160.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713896,"comment":null},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":172.24,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":173.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202792,"comment":null},{"amount":135.4,"local_amount":361.08,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":363.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401261,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She lives comfortably in her own house, along with two of her children: Eber and Iris, 22 and 28 years old, respectively, and with her 20-year-old granddaughter, Erika.\r\n\r\nRosario's business activity is the fabrication and sale of charcoal, made from wood scraps from nearby sawmills. She has a space near the sawmills where she gathers her wood scraps and sets them on fire, allowing the pile to burn for several days until the charcoal is ready for sale. The sales fulfill the various orders that she has, leaving her customers satisfied.\r\n\r\nShe began her business more than thirty years ago, starting slowly with her own capital, which she grew through significant effort.

Este ser\u00e1 el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 3 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Por tanto espera de su colaboraci\u00f3n, para continuar con sus objetivos. Por otro lado se compromete una vez m\u00e1s de cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en anteriores cr\u00e9dito que tuvo. Adem\u00e1s de estar a gusto con su banco comunal por considerarlo un grupo unido y solidario. Con el monto solicitado de 1000 nuevos soles, los invertir\u00e1 comprando ingredientes para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus comidas como arroz, az\u00facar, fideos, aceites y otros en mayores cantidades y a precios m\u00e1s bajos, para as\u00ed tener mayores ganancias.\n\n","en":"Margarita, 37 years old, is a hardworking and earnest woman with a great drive to get ahead as well as to be friendly and joyful. She is separated from the father of her three children-- Henry who is 19 years old, Jennifer who is 14 years old, and Juana who is 3 years old-- who are her motivation to work. Together they live comfortably in their own home which she bought with the fruits of her labor. Margarita\u2019s business is selling meals which she makes in her home and brings to her customers at a civil construction site, and she collects payments weekly. Her customers are happy with the good flavor and the excellent service that she provides them with her punctuality.  \r\n\r\nShe began more than two years ago with a particular loan and so far she\u2019s had her kids\u2019 help with the transport and delivery of her orders. She feels that her business is very profitable due to the earnings it provides. On the other hand she says that she decided to begin her business due to needing a job in order to support her kids since she\u2019d separated from their father and the child support was not enough to cover costs. \r\n\r\nAbove all, now she\u2019s seeing good results, and she has plans to open a restaurant in the future in some rented shop in the commercial area of the city. This will be her 3rd loan with MFP, and so she hopes for their help in order to continue with her goals. She again promises to comply with the terms of her agreement as with previous loans she\u2019s had. Additionally, she likes her communal bank because she considers it to be a solid and unified group. She will invest the requested amount of 1000 nuevos soles in the purchase of ingredients to make her meals like rice, sugar, noodles, oil, and other things in bulk quantities and at lower prices in order to have better profits.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1009443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, sugar, noodles, oil, and canned goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":144.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":159.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":165.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":166.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":178.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":184.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":114.26,"local_amount":304.68,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":306.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099767,"comment":null},{"amount":62.16,"local_amount":165.76,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":166.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713898,"comment":null},{"amount":62.58,"local_amount":166.9,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":167.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202794,"comment":null},{"amount":66.81,"local_amount":178.16,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":179.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098464,"comment":null},{"amount":69.19,"local_amount":184.5,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":185.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401263,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She lives with Eli who works and is the father of her daughter Jilary, 2 years old, for whom she motivates herself to work. They live together in her parents\u2019 home along with her brother. \r\n\r\nSety sells food like roast chicken, Peruvian tamales, stews, and beverages. She has a table that she\u2019s set up in front of her house each afternoon where she gives good service to her customers who eat her food every day, earning their loyalty. She also has a moto-taxi that she rents, generating more income. \r\n\r\nShe began more than one year ago with a loan, and so far she\u2019s had her mom\u2019s help in serving customers. She believes her business to be profitable due to the earnings it provides and the demand that she has for her food since her customers always want to eat it, regularly selling out of what she\u2019s made to sell. \r\n\r\nShe decided to begin work after the birth of her daughter and due to the need to increase the household income in order to provide a better quality of life. Because of that and seeing the good results that she\u2019s had from her business, she has plans to redo her home and set up a garage in order to provide car storage service. \r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with MFP. She is happy and thankful to know that she will continue to have a line of credit in order to implement her plans. She also likes her communal bank\u2019s work since she considers it to be a united and solid group. She will invest the requested amount of 1000 nuevos soles into the purchase of products to maintain her moto-taxi, such as the processing of documents, and with the remainder she will buy ingredients to make her food.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1009448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients to make food and parts for her moto-taxi.

He's polygamous and has four spouses and six children. He lives with his four wives and children in M\u00e9dine, a working-class neighborhood in Sikasso.\r\n\r\nAfter trying several businesses without success, he became quickly familiar more than ten years ago with the business of stocking and selling sweet peas, shea nuts, and cereals.\r\n\r\nWith such experience in this field, he enjoys a strong reputation and receives lots of orders from outside the country. However, he lacks the necessary resources to meet this demand.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, he therefore decided to join Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso, and benefited from four loans, which he repaid without problems.\r\n\r\nEager to better meet an ever-increasing customer demand, he's seeking this fifth loan to be able to buy 20 sacks of sweet peas, three tons of corn, 10 sacks of millet, and 10 sacks of shea nuts.\r\n\r\nHe gets his supplies in the villages surrounding Sikasso, and stock them in his store located at the new market in M\u00e9dine.

He is married to Alicia and they have four children: sixteen year old twins, and two youngsters, ages 15 and 12.  The family lives in the indigenous community of Inchatingari, district of Peren\u00e9, province de Chanchamayo.  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has been working since he was a child, and at a young age, he was already working on his parents\u2019 farm. In this way, he learned about agriculture, which is how he supports his family today.  \r\n\r\nHe has two coffee plots in production and a parcel of land that he has just cleared in order to plant small plants.  In addition, he grows citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons.  \u201cLast year, he harvested 40 sacks of coffee and sold them at a good price\u201d, he says.  When the work on the farms doesn\u2019t require added care, he works as a laborer on other farms.  In this way, he earns extra income for his daily expenses.  He sells all of his produce at the Pichanaki fruit market, where buyers come from various cities and pay him a fair price for his harvest.  \r\n\r\nOne of his goals is to acquire more land, which he must either purchase or lease.  Sales of coffee and achiote (a spice made from the red seed of the annatto tree) are more than profitable, and will enable him to achieve this goal.  This will be his third loan with MFP and he accepts responsibility for making his monthly payments on time.  His communal bank is called \u201cProductores Inchatingari\u201d, and he says that he feels comfortable with his companions because of the organized and orderly manner in which the group works.  \r\n\r\nHe will invest the funds in two thousand coffee plants and organic fertilizer to finish the parcel of land that he had cultivated a short time ago.  He will also pay day laborers, who will assist him with this chore.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1010174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase coffee plants and sacks of fertilizer, and to hire laborers.

She buys these products from the distributor, and sells them among her neighbors. She is well-known, because of the time she has been in that business. She got started little by little with a loan from MFP, buying in small quantities, and on seeing the reception this had, decided to continue, so far doing this on her own.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business quite profitable because of the earnings it provides, and she uses these to pay her expenses and to reinvest in working capital. Before starting her business, she had financial problems, as her elderly husband has health problems; and as his income is not regular, he needs financial support from his children. That is why she decided to start the business, in order to support their expenses.   \r\n\r\nShe hopes to increase her business's stock of products, and see it grow, in order to have greater earnings. This will be her fifth loan with the MFP institution. She is thankful to know that she will continue to have a line of credit so that she can keep her business going. That is why she says that she will be responsible in paying her installments, as with her previous loans. In addition she says she is content with her communal bank as she considers it a close-knit and responsible group. \r\n\r\nShe will use the amount of 1,300 nuevos soles applied for to purchase merchandise for her store such as soft drinks and candy, in order to supply it, and have a varied stock to sell.

They have five children who range in age form one to twenty years old.  Laura and her family live under their own roof in the indigenous community of Inchatingari, district of Peren\u00e9, province of Chanchamayo. \r\n\r\nLaura begins a variety of activities the moment the first rays of sun shine over her community.  She takes care of her home and family so that they can also begin their daily activities.  After she finishes her household chores, she takes care of her farmland.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she has three plots of fertile land, in which she plants achiote (a spice made from the red seed of the annatto tree), coffee, and citrus fruits such as tangelos (hybrid fruit that is a cross between a grapefruit and a tangerine) and oranges.  \u201cI grow it all, but coffee and achiote are best for me as there is demand throughout the year\u201d, she says.  \r\n\r\nProduction of achiote is common in her region.  Each harvest yields 2500 kilos and each kilo sells for between 5 and 7 soles. These days, the price is low reaching 4 soles and 50 c\u00e9ntimos.   However, she is certain that, beginning in April, the price will be profitable for her.  \r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work, her children are assured food, clothing, and an education.  Her immediate goals are to expand her farmland and improve production, and in order to achieve them, she must invest in the purchase of land and fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with MFP, and she is committed to making her monthly payments on time, as she has done in the past. \u201cLos Productores Inchatingari\u201d is the name of her communal bank and she feels happy to be a part of such a solid and hard-working group.

As he notes, \u201cThese woods sell quickly, and people buy them for making durable furniture.\u201d\r\n\r\nOscar is sure that between these two activities he will be able to provide his children with an education.  Oscar\u2019s children, for their part, assist him with the household chores, and the oldest ones help him with his work in the field and with his wood business.\r\n\r\nThis would be Oscar\u2019s third loan with MFP, and he promises to make all of his monthly payments on time.  He also says that he is glad to be part of the \u201cProductores de Inchatingari\u201d [\u201cProducers of Inchatingari\u201d] communal bank because its members are all supportive and responsible people.\r\n\r\nOscar will use the loan to pay day laborers that he plans to hire to clear weeds around his recently-planted coffee crop.

He wants to have technical studies and continue with his work, and he doesn't want to neglect his family, as he appreciates them a lot. \r\n\r\nThis will be the 6th loan that he will obtain from Microfinanzas Prisma, and as a result he gives his word that he will be punctual with the payment of his monthly quotas. He belongs to the communal bank \"Uni\u00f3n por el Trabajo\" and giving honor to his name will continue working hard to achieve his objectives. \r\n\r\nHe will invest the money in the purchase of sacks of organic fertilizer to fertilize his potato crop. Additionally, he will pay the services of the laborers he has contracted for the harvest of his plots."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1010894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of fertilizer and to contract laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nohy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2011.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447805,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T01:43:53Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395212,"name":"Chenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chenda, age 48, is a widow with one son and two daughters.

61 years old.  She lives with her son's family and takes care of her grandson.  Zagipa worked for 36 years as an elementary school teacher, and she is now retired.  For a source of supplemental income for her family, in 1996 Zagipa started her own business in animal husbandry and farming.  \r\nThanks to her tenacity and perseverance, the business she started with 12,000 soum (KGS) now brings in about 8,000 soum per month from the sale of dairy and meat products.  Zagipa also cultivates 3.66 ha, where she grows potatoes, cereal crops, and sainfoin.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further development of her business, Zagipa turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 soum (KGS) for the purchase of cattle and seed for high-yield potatoes. Zagipa is planning to invest the income in further expansion of her farm."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1019997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock and potato seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chyrak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zagipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285514,"comment":null},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5021.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339115,"comment":null},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10042,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095461,"comment":null},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5021.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329709,"comment":null},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10042,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938471,"comment":null},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10042.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071010,"comment":null},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012201,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:23:38Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:58:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394949,"name":"Candida Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a C\u00e1ndida es originaria de Estel\u00ed tiene 2 hijos de los cuales solo uno esta en la escuela, de oficio comerciante, se dedica a la venta de comida.

She is married and the mother of six children.  She lives with her husband and children in Hamdallaye, one of the working-class neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nRamatou has been buying and selling condiments for over thirty years.  She started this activity when she was very young, alongside her mother.  In order to better meet the needs of an increasing number of customers, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about seven years ago.  After several solidarity loans (group loans) taken with a women's association in Kadiolo Noumousso, she is now on to her fifth individual loan.  All her previous loans have been duly repaid.\r\n\r\nWith this current loan, she is planning to buy 15 boxes of tomato concentrate, 8 boxes of Maggi cubes, 5 bags of pepper grains, 4 bags of dried onions, 3 bags of laurel leaves and 8 boxes of mustard at the Grand Market in Sikasso.  She is planning to resell her merchandise for retail or wholesale, for cash or on credit, to customers who are consumers or retailers themselves. She will do so at the new market in M\u00e9dine where she is already reselling.\r\n\r\nWith her loan, Ramatou is expecting monthly profits to reach 120,000 CFA francs, which will be used to contribute to family expenses, pay off her loan's interest and invest the rest in her activity.  \r\n\r\nHer ambition is to become a wholesaler on the market where she currently works, in order to serve the retailers of that market who are often having a hard time accessing supplies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1019980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Now Vilma, along with her husband, carry a great responsibility: it has to do with her children and also with the farm that they've managed to won with great effort. Nevertheless, they have to face the difficulties that they have with the pests that have managed to damage their coffee fruits. For this reason they have gone to MFP's loans to request a loan so they can solve the problems that affect their production. This will be loan number 7 with MFP. She feels committed to the financing for which she will be punctual with all of her repayments. In her bank, she is thorough member. With the 2,000 new \"soles\", she will buy agrochemical fertilizers so the pests do not affect her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1012138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizers and agrochemicals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T10:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T10:00:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2010,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455635,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T19:02:08Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394159,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Delia, de 54 a\u00f1os, es una mujer amable y buena, est\u00e1 casada con Carlos de 60, ella tiene dos hijos a quienes educo y formo para ser personas productivas en la sociedad y ya son mayores e independientes, vive a lado de su esposo en su casa propia.

Rosa is an entrepreneurial woman who has always enjoyed working in business since she was very young.  This helped her to cover her school expenses.  Rosa tells us that when she was in her third year of elementary school, her father made her a small wooden box which she filled with candies and then went out to sell them in every market in Pichari district so that she could cover some of her school expenses.  This is how she started off in business.

is fifty-six years old, a mother of seven children, living in Baray district of Kompong Tom province. She is in the same business as her husband; both are local rice cultivators.

She makes profits and, at the same time, entertains herself.  She has been in this business for 12 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to go out very early as it is very dangerous.  She recalls that she started out in this business because her household income was low and this meant she was unable to provide her daughters with a good education.  However, since she started working, things improved a lot.  Over time, she hopes to be able to start selling new clothing which she will bring back from the city of Lima.\r\n\r\nThis will be Doris' seventh loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges, once again, to make her repayments on time and show, once again, that she is a very good member who repays the support she receives from her community bank which is made up of very responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nDoris will use the 1,500 soles she has requested to buy more clothing so that she can continue in her business selling in the villages.

She enjoys her job because she gets to be around people so she isn't alone when her husband and son go out to work, and also because it generates a good income thanks to her good levels of daily sales.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mercedes' eighth loan from MFP, which she hopes to use to carry out her plans.

During her time in this job, she has learnt the importance of smiling all her customers, as this keeps them coming back and she is able to generate more sales and increase her income. She hopes with time to be able to remodel her home and put in a larger workshop and a Broaster fried chicken restaurant.\r\n\r\nThis will be Sobeida's fifth loan with MFP. Things are going very well with her group and she is happy to know that she has the financial support she needs to keep doing her work. She promises to carry on being a punctual and responsible member of the bank, as she has been up to now. With the loan of 1,000 soles she has requested, she will buy ingredients and products for her job, as well as some other materials and tools she needs to continue her work making items of clothing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1012932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy materials and sewing tools, as well as ingredients for making salchipapas (a Peruvian snack of hot dogs and fries).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sobeida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":153.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":158.77},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":164.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":165.86},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":177.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":180.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.94,"local_amount":311.84,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":313.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099799,"comment":null},{"amount":61.76,"local_amount":164.69,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":165.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713930,"comment":null},{"amount":62.2,"local_amount":165.86,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":166.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202826,"comment":null},{"amount":66.38,"local_amount":177.03,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":177.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098495,"comment":null},{"amount":67.72,"local_amount":180.58,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":181.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401311,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T18:41:56Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396147,"name":"Jose Encarnacion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jose Encarnacion es soltero, tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad,estudia en la universidad para prepararse mejor, se dedica al momento a la artesan\u00eda al tejido de cortes picos, inici\u00f3 como operario con sus padres y hasta el momento lleva 20 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizara para la compra de hilos de diferente clases y colores. ya que quiere mejora y tener un negocio grande.","en":"Jose Encarnacion is single, 20 years old, and studies at the university to prepare himself better.

is a 32-year-old man; he is married with no children yet.

This will improve the family's home living conditions.\r\n\r\nEyad is photographed in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She is a single mother and has a 6-year-old son called Jockmer.  They live together in their own home which Susana bought together with her ex-partner before they separated.  \r\n\r\nSusana's business is selling meals, soft drinks, hamburgers and pies which she makes to her own recipe.  She prepares all her food in her mother's house as it is closer to her sales location.  She also provides lunches to workers on a construction site at a school which makes her 25 orders a day.  This gives her a regular, fixed income.  She started her business with a loan from her sister who also works in this trade and who encouraged her, showing her the profits that the business makes.  She started off preparing her food in small quantities, with a certain amount of trepidation at first, but when she saw how she was managing to sell all the food she prepared, she decided to keep going.  She says that she has been in some financial tight spots in the past as she is both mother and father to her son who needs food and an education.  Given this need, she looked for a trade that would make enough to support him.  Now that she is making good profits, Susana would like her business to thrive and, in the future, she would like to open another business (a stationery store) in her home.\r\n\r\nThis will be Susana's fifth loan from MFP.  She feels grateful to know that she will have financial support as this makes her feel more certain that she will achieve her goals.  She feels happy to be a member of her community bank as she believes it to be a united and supportive group.  Susana will use the 3,000 soles that she has requested to invest in buying a vehicle.  She will buy a second-hand motorcycle taxi (which costs 2,000 soles).  This will save her having to pay for transportation when she delivers her meals to her diners.  She will use the remaining money to buy ingredients for preparing her food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1013091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a motorcycle taxi and ingredients for preparing food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T16:00:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":449.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":478.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":476.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":514.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":546.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":348.17,"local_amount":928.46,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":933.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099802,"comment":null},{"amount":180.13,"local_amount":480.36,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":482.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713933,"comment":null},{"amount":193.78,"local_amount":516.76,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":519.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202829,"comment":null},{"amount":200.62,"local_amount":534.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":537.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098498,"comment":null},{"amount":202.3,"local_amount":539.43,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":542.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401314,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:24:18Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395937,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen is 33 years old and is the mother of 2 children.

He is a determined and hardworking man who is also happy and friendly.  He is married to Rosa, who is a teacher.  Their children are Grely, 30 years old, Saulo, 28, who is disabled, and Juan, who is 21 years old.  They live together in their own house along with his nephew Omar, who is also disabled.  \r\n\r\nNoe works selling water and washing cars.  He has a space set up in his house where he attends to his customers, giving them fast service.  He is closed for a week because the town is making repairs to the street.  He started his business more than nine years ago with a bank loan.  His children help him service the customers.  He considers his business to be profitable because of the income he earns and the continued visits of his customers.  He decided to start his business so that he had a job since he was not successful at finding work, and he saw the opportunity based on the location of his house.\r\n\r\nNow he feels more comfortable economically and has plans to expand his business, for example opening a bookstore in his house since it is located close to a high school.  This is his third loan with MFP and he hopes their collaboration will continue so he can meet his objectives.  With a loan of 3000 nuevos soles, he will purchase a used mototaxi for 2300 nuevos soles so that he can rent it out.  With the rest of the loan, he will make repairs to his car wash to offer better service to his customers.

She lives with Ronald who is an employee and the father of her children.  Most of her children are now independent.  Teresa and her husband live comfortably together in their own home together with their youngest son Luis who is 12 years old.\r\n\r\nTeresa's business is selling food in the evenings such as 'juanes' (a traditional chicken dish), grilled fish, noodles, etc.  She sets up a table in front of her home and serves all of her customers with a lot of kindness.  Her customers are mainly her neighbors and passersby.  She is re-starting this business after she had left if owing to some personal problems.  She is now acquiring the equipment she needs to re-start her business such as plates, pans, etc.  She will work alone.\r\n\r\nTeresa considers her business to be fairy profitable because of the demand she has.  She is very well-known in her area and her food is popular.  It was her neighbors who asked her to re-start her business.  Teresa says that she has financial problems because her partner's income isn't enough to cover all their expenses.  This is why she wants to support him with this additional income.  Given how profitable her business is and the orders she has, she would like to start again and continue working so that she can grow her business and, in the future, open a restaurant because she enjoys cooking.\r\n\r\nThis will be Teresa's fifth loan from MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have financial support in carrying out her plans.  She pledges to be responsible in making her loan repayments as she was with her previous loans.  She says that she is very happy to belong to her community bank because of the support that they give to people through access to loans.  Teresa will invest the 1,500 soles she has requested in buying equipment for her business such as pans, glasses and plates.  She will also buy tables, chairs, and ingredients she needs for preparing her meals.  She will buy at low prices because she will be buying for cash and in bulk."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1013130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy pans, glasses, plates, tables, chairs and ingredients so that she can prepare more food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T16:20:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":222.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":239.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":248.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":266.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":272.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":177.22,"local_amount":462.31,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":474.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099806,"comment":null},{"amount":95.18,"local_amount":248.31,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-17T08:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":255.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713937,"comment":null},{"amount":95.86,"local_amount":250.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":256.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202833,"comment":null},{"amount":102.3,"local_amount":266.89,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":274.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098502,"comment":null},{"amount":104.44,"local_amount":272.44,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":279.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401318,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T03:34:05Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396013,"name":"Mhabad's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mhabad is a conservative 49-year-old Iraqi woman, a wife and a mother of five children.

She has a great will to advance. She lives with her partner, Elvis, who is a laborer and the father of their three children, Liza, who is 18, Elvis, who is 14, and Brenda, who is 5. Together they live comfortably in their own house, which they bought with great effort.\r\n\r\nGriselda's business is selling beauty products such as nail polish, lipstick, lotions, and other items. She also sells a variety of clothing for women, men, and children, items in different styles and that are in fashion. She acquires all these products through catalogs and she sells them from her house to her friends, relatives, and neighbors, whom she serves in a kind and cordial manner, winning their business. Thus they recommend her to other people, who in time become regular customers.\r\n\r\nShe began this business more than four years ago, with a little capital of her own, and so far her sister and her daughter have helped her obtain new customers. She considers her business fairly profitable because of the earnings it provides her, along with the opportunity to be a prosperous businesswoman.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning her business, she had financial problems, since she was not practicing her profession of teaching, and she needed an income to continue paying for the education of their children, since her partner's income was only sufficient for food. Now, seeing her good results, she has plans to continue and with her earnings invest in arranging their house to refurbish rooms to rent, looking to generate more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have financial support to advance with her business. For this, she assures that she will be punctual in making her payments to have a good credit record and have access to more loans in the future. In addition, she comments that she feels comfortable in her communal bank because she considers all the members to be good and united people. With the 2000 PEN that she has applied for, she will invest in the purchase of merchandise such as clothing of various styles for all genders, since she has orders to fill. She will also buy more beauty products to have a stock on hand for sale, in both cases seeking lower prices by making her purchases for cash and in volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1013174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more cosmetics and clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Griselda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":299.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":319.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":317.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":342.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":355.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":365.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":232.02,"local_amount":618.72,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":621.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099811,"comment":null},{"amount":119.17,"local_amount":317.78,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":319.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713942,"comment":null},{"amount":128.53,"local_amount":342.76,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":344.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202838,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":355.54,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":357.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098507,"comment":null},{"amount":136.95,"local_amount":365.2,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":367.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401323,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T22:10:54Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396441,"name":"Milcah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milcah, age 56, owns and operates a grocery store to earn a living.

She lives with her partner, Daniel, who is independent and the father of her four children, two of whom are on their own.  They live together in their own home with their two children who are 19 and 17 and whom they love very much.  Marja sells different brands and flavors of carbonated drinks for a living.  For this business, she has a refrigerator in her house where she keeps her products ice cold like her customers like them because it is so hot where she lives.  She serves her customers from there very courteously.\r\n\r\nShe also has a mototaxi that she rents out to earn extra income.\r\n\r\nShe started both businesses over seven years ago, then used her earnings to set up her house to sell drinks by putting in tables and chairs for her customers' comfort.  So far she has done all of this on her own.\r\n\r\nShe thinks her business is pretty profitable because of the earnings she has made and because of the demand for her products.\r\n\r\nShe decided to start her business because she wanted to be able to have her own income to count on to help her partner with the household expenses.  She thought that it would allow them to make progress more quickly.\r\n\r\nAs such, seeing the results of her businesses, she wants to continue and increase her stock in her products in order to see her business grow.  This will be her eighth loan with MFP.  She is thankful and happy to know that she can continue to count on their financial support to move ahead with her business.  She is also happy with her communal bank because she knows the other members and she considers them to be responsible people.  With the requested sum of 1,000 nuevos soles, she will buy merchandise in greater volume and look for better prices for her purchases, which will allow her to earn more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1013180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a greater variety of soft drinks\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marja ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":148.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":159.49},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":165.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.6},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":182.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.5,"local_amount":308.01,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":309.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099812,"comment":null},{"amount":62.04,"local_amount":165.43,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-17T08:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":166.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713943,"comment":null},{"amount":62.48,"local_amount":166.6,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":167.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202839,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":177.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":178.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098508,"comment":null},{"amount":68.31,"local_amount":182.15,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":183.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401324,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T17:45:02Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396018,"name":"Mhabat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mhabat is a 52 year woman from Iraq.

She is separated and she sews for a living.  She is the mother of three children who are 18, 15, and 10 years old.  She lives in her own home, which she was able to build through a lot of hard work.  Piedad sews, making clothing for men, women, and children for all occasions: graduations, fifteenth birthday parties, school clothes, and more.  She makes everything in her own home in an area well equipped with sewing machines and furniture where she attends her customers very courteously.  She works for a private company half-time and in the afternoons she sews.  She started in this business because she learned sewing from watching her mother and realized that it is profitable.  When she started, she only had one machine that she bought with and MFP loan, but now she's well set up.  She does this business with a friend.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she considers her business to be profitable because she makes a good income that allows her to offer her children a better education and a good level of comfort.  It also allows her to cover her household expenses as she is both mother and father to her children.  Before starting this business her income didn't cover everything.  She hopes to keep growing, to buy new machines, and to expand her business.  This will be her second loan with MFP and she is very happy to be able to count on the financial support she has received.  Because of it, she will make progress with her business and she will become a great businesswoman.  She also tells us that she is very happy to be part of a responsible group.  With the requested loan for 1,500 nuevos soles, she will buy sewing materials, such as fabrics and elastic, among other things, to use in her business and to complete the orders she has pending.  She will get all of these materials in the capital in order to look for better prices for her bulk purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1013182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy fabric, elastic, zippers, and other sewing materials\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Piedad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.14,"local_amount":467.33,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":480.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099813,"comment":null},{"amount":91.25,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":244.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713944,"comment":null},{"amount":98.42,"local_amount":256.73,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":263.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202840,"comment":null},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":266.3,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":273.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098509,"comment":null},{"amount":104.11,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":279.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401325,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T14:57:06Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396558,"name":"Huda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Huda is a conservative woman who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\nHuda is a 35 year old woman who is a mother with five sons and one daughter.

He is located in the Prey Chor District of Kampong Charm province, Cambodia. Three of the children are living with him, and the other seven are married and live in separate houses from each other. \r\n\r\nTo establish a comfortable living for the big family, Mr. So is working hard from day to day to support his family's everyday needs.
