is from Gyumri city in the Shirak region. He lives with his wife and daughter. Arshak and his wife work as teachers at school. Their salaries, however, are so low that they cannot afford a living, based on their salaries alone. \r\n\r\nArshak is engaged in beekeeping, which is an important source of income for the family. He sells the honey in the local market. As life is getting more expensive day-by-day, Arshak needs to obtain new beehives to be able to meet the needs of his family. \r\n\r\nA loan of USD 1,000 will be great support to Arshak and his family, helping him to purchase 15 beehives. Arshak has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately he wasn't able to return it. However, thanks to hard work during the recent times, he was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. \r\n\r\nThe second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

The loan will go to providing her the working capital needed to serve these customers, grow her business, and make the day-to-day operations of her business more efficient. \r\n \r\nAngelina is confident that she will be able to open additional mobile money outlets.

Raising cattle used to be just a side job when he was a carpenter and made good money, but now it is the main source of income for his family. Qurbonali has three cows in his barn and is diligently working to increase his herd. Having a large herd will mean that Qurbonali has a successful business and a secure future. Qurbonali is married and has a son, age 19, and three daughters, ages 18, 16, and 11. His eldest daughter and son are studying at university in Kulob, and the younger daughters are in school. \r\n\r\nQurbonali has asked for a loan to purchase several cows and calves.

He served his country for 20 years. Abduqodir retired at the rank of colonel, with his head held high. Now he is 60 years old. He is the father of five children and is a grandfather. He lives with his large family in the region of Hamadoni.\r\n\r\nAbduqodir currently doesn't work. He decided to start his own business buying and selling cattle.

She is starting out as an entrepreneur. Gulchera plans to start a business buying and selling cattle. She has planned out her business plan in advance. Her only restriction is the lack of funds. Gulchera has stocked hay for the winter and built a shelter for cattle. Now, she has decided to realize her ideas with the help of a loan. Then she will be provided with a good business and a good income. She is not afraid to do a large amount of work, because she can always get help from her husband and son. Her husband works as a cargo truck driver. Another son is working abroad. Gulchera has 3 daughters. They will be very happy if their mother has a business, and they would help her.

He is married. He has two children. They all live in the city of Khujand. This is also where Davron works. He works as a master finisher. He does repairs in apartments and homes on order. Because of the fact that winter is very cold, people repair their homes only in the summer. Davron has seasonal work, therefore in winter he has no income.
