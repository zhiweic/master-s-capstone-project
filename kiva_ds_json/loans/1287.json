She is 34 years old and attended school up to class VIII (Grade 8). She lives with her husband and only daughter aged 17 years.  They have a small semi-pacca house (brick-built with a straw roof). Her daughter is a student in class twelve (Grade 12). Her husband Ratan, who is 38 years old, is a farmer.  He completed his primary education.  He is engaged in agriculture, but due to lack of capital, he cannot invest much money in his business.  He is the main breadwinner of the family and works hard to be able to make ends meet.  Yet he is unable to give enough financial sustenance to the family.\r\n\r\nGeeta is determined to help her husband by providing financial assistance. So she has decided to take a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BJS, who gives loans to rural women, to buy potato seeds and fertilizers to start a potato cultivation business in their own plot of land. She is very energetic and enthusiastic and hopes to earn profits by selling the produce in the local market.  It is a profitable business as the produce has a good demand in the present market.\r\n\r\nGeeta's goals are to upgrade the financial condition of their family, give her daughter a good future, and enhance the business to secure their future.  She dreams of building a pacca house (concrete-made) of their own with the profits from the business.\r\n\r\nGeeta and her family will be thankful to both BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1485553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase potato seeds and fertilizers for starting cultivation of potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-07T17:02:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653959,"name":"Nercita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nercita is married with two children.

Leonard has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nLeonard is married and has 6 children.  He is 41 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Leonard has been a farmer for 25 years.  He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t.\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Leonard\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also wants to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  As an active member in his community, Leonard also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  He wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Leonard plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, buy a goat and invest in a business.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvests and is able to save money.  He has more farm training and farm group support.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Leonard and the Alala Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is 1 additional group leader in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":5925,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janepher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleophas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caleb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geoffrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clare","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":513504,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":513504}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653964,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is a 46 year old woman from the town of Maribojoc, Bohol.

Roderick has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 81 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nRoderick is married and has 18 children.  He is 74 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Roderick has been a farmer for 41 years.  Roderick described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Roderick\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also wants to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  As an active member in his community, Roderick also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, and he wants to help more farmers.  He wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Roderick plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair their home, save for the future, buy a goat and invest in a business.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvests and is able to save money.  He also has more farm training and group support through this program. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Roderick and the Action Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is 1 additional group leader in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T02:50:03Z","loan_amount":5800,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roderick","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":502806,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":502806}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642409,"name":"Onua-Do Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These five members are part of a group called 'onua-do' who all live in the same neighborhood and work together whenever the need arises.

She now has other machines and is able to make various styles of sweaters. Thanks to the support of her husband and that of her children, she keeps moving ahead with her work.\r\n\r\nShe used the loan that she received to invest in raw material to be able to make her sweaters, as now at the end of the year she gets requests by the dozen.

Both of them are very responsible and hard workers. They work as construction builders and carry out verbal contracts to work for the town. In addition to this source of income, Carmen sells food. \r\n\r\nWith much effort and dedication, they bought an urban lot a few years ago where they recently built a home with four rooms. But due the lack of money, they are asking for this loan to finish constructing their home. \r\n\r\nWith this they can complete their goals and have a finished house to live more comfortably and also use one of the four rooms to sell food. Their ultimate goal is to offer a better service and increase their income to improve the living conditions of their family.

Therefore, he took advantage of the opportunity and good timing to be the only one offering these items in his city.

He was born and raised in a humble agricultural family.  Agricultural work was a way to make a living so he learned all of the different tasks in the fields and today he is able to make his own money with corn crops that he harvests and sells in the town market where he lives. He also works as a day laborer on various farms that belong to relatives and neighbors.  With his spirit of constant improvement and a desire to contribute to his family's income, at the age of 22 he decided to start a small retail stand on the lot where his house is. For this reason he is requesting a loan to purchase his initial inventory wholesale (snacks, soft drinks, beer, liquor, baked goods, etc.).  He will also purchase agricultural products to fertilize his corn crops and prepare the land for the next harvest.  The loan will allow him to start up his new business and improve his plants' output with the appropriate care.  He will earn more income to help out his family.  Diego, like all young people, has hopes and dreams, and fights for them tirelessly.  He wants to expand his crops and have a well stocked little store to guarantee economic stability that will allow him to improve his living conditions and the wellbeing of his family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1506152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase inventory wholesale (snacks, soft drinks, beer, liquor, baked goods, etc,) and to purchase agricultural products to fertilize his corn crops and prepare the and for the next harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-01-06T05:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T05:30:04Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diego Alexander ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":89754},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92234},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94783},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":97403},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100094},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":102861},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":105703},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":108625},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111626},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":114711},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":117882},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":121139},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":124487},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":127927},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":131463},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":135096},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":138830},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":142666},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":146609},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150661},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":154824},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":159103},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":163500},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":168019}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.91},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.71},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":654007,"name":"Mary Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Ann works hard to support her family.

The past few months have been very difficult - her purse was stolen, with money in it, and to keep her business going she sold her own milking cow. Momokiz is the primary breadwinner in the family, as her husband is a working migrant in Russia and doesn't send back enough money. The amount that he does send, she uses for her children's education costs at the medical university. Momokiz is requesting a loan of 2,500 somoni to purchase winter clothing for her three children.

Zikrillo is 36. He is married with three children. His wife is a homemaker and takes care of household chores. Their three children are in school. Zikrillo has tried many things in his life and has a great deal of experience in retail and trade. At first he started working in animal husbandry - he bought cattle from one market and resold them with markup at another cattle market. After that he started selling potatoes and onions. He bought goods at wholesale prices from the growers and sold them with markup at a small market near his home. In such a way, he was able to save money, which he put toward the acquisition of a milk stall to sell dairy products. Zikrillo has made the decision to start a new business selling dairy products. He has about $600, but it is not enough to acquire the inventory he needs to begin. For this reason he is asking for a loan. He has already found a milk processor where he will buy his goods and he just needs help to start his business.

The company\u2019s core business is to prepare corporate and individual tax returns.  The company\u2019s secondary services are to prepare small business\u2019 financial statements, assist with 8-a certification and help businesses with the incorporation process.  \r\n \r\nThe reason Geraldo is in need of financing is because of the seasonality of his business. As Geraldo explained, his peak season follows the tax season (January 15th \u2013 October 15th). The months of November and December are the slowest and it\u2019s during this time that Geraldo\u2019s company generates income from its secondary services, which are less profitable. Last fall, Geraldo went to the \u201cloan sharks\u201d for a 33 percent interest rate loan to help him get over this \u201chump.\u201d He vowed to not go down that path again this fall. He turned to LEDC to help him during this lull in business before the tax season ramps back up in January 2014.  \r\n \r\nGeraldo is originally from Queens, New York.

Victor has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving funds for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nVictor is 62 years old and has been a farmer for 42 years.  Victor works as a farmer to provide for his 9 children.  The community and other farmers know Victor as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community activities such as the men's group and prayer group.  Victor described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nVictor joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Victor joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family.  Because he likes being a leader, and he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers. Victor has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Victor's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training and has more farm group support.  In the future, Victor hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to repair the home, save for the future and invest in a business.\r\n\r\nVictor and the Amuka Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T17:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T17:10:04Z","loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Humphreys","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bosco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":251403,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251403}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643130,"name":"Roxana Yaneth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roxana de 18 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio solamente hasta noveno grado, dado a que se acompa\u00f1o y no pudo seguir estudiando y decidi\u00f3 mejor poner un negocio.

His biggest dream in life is to practice farming as a business and to free people in his community from poverty by helping them to adopt good agricultural practices."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1506358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a mobile phone, solar charging set, and a weighing scale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kasese","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":259,"posted_date":"2014-01-06T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sadayo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":35,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-09T10:17:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":654162,"name":"Kadie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 36-year-old Kadie from Masuba, Makeni Northern area in Sierra Leone.

He is married with one child, aged 16. \r\n\r\nHe would like to use Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizers during maize production.  He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
