is a 32-year-old single mother of two children living in Kasese, Uganda.

The family's only sources of income are the small monthly salary earned by Marekh working in a store as a saleslady and Marekh\u2019s mother's retirement pension. This income is hardly enough to cover the family's food and everyday expenses. On several occasions, Marekh requested a loan from local financial institutions for starting a trading business, but she had no success. Her loan requests were always rejected because of her low income and lack of job experience, criteria usually demanded by the local credit providers. \r\n\r\n<p>Marekh's loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative through Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\n<p>Marekh will purchase stocks of clothes in Tbilisi (the capital city) for wholesale prices and resell them in her village for a profit. It will be hard work for Marekh, but according to her estimations, the business will be profitable and increase the family's income. The increased profit will be reinvested in the business to increase her stock and sales volume.

Raising livestock is his main source of income.  He purchases livestock at the market, fattens it for two to three months and sells it at the same market for more money.  He likes this business a lot and Nishonali earns a good income from this business.  Of course his wife supports and helps him.  While Nishonali raises livestock he does not want his children to follow in his footsteps and tries hard to set up good conditions for their studies.  His dream is to give his children an education so that in the future his children can have a profession and be a support for him in his old age.  In order to grow his business Nishonali plans to buy several more heads of livestock and he has turned to Kiva for this.  He is asking for a loan to increase his livestock count and to expand his business.

She insists that her family is the most important thing in her life and any sacrifice for them is well worth it.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":185.94,"image":{"id":1289486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-02-05T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-07T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24994},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25685},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26395},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27124},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27874},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28645},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29436},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30250},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31086},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31946},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32829},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33736}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13.72,"local_amount":24010,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":24552.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356518077,"comment":null},{"amount":15.6,"local_amount":27306,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":27922.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364552306,"comment":null},{"amount":31.72,"local_amount":55505,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":56758.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373514007,"comment":null},{"amount":16.36,"local_amount":28629,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":29275.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390981660,"comment":null},{"amount":16.93,"local_amount":29626,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":30295.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400821533,"comment":null},{"amount":17.36,"local_amount":30376,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":31062.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410806590,"comment":null},{"amount":17.82,"local_amount":31186,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":31890.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420094723,"comment":null},{"amount":37.14,"local_amount":65003,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":66471.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430073857,"comment":null},{"amount":19.29,"local_amount":33766,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34528.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009100,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-05T20:49:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":524600,"name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 47 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer que le ha tocado padecer las inclemencias del fr\u00edo, la lluvia y el hambre.

In addition, he raises sheep for meat purposes. Shukur has 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father, who taught him the best ways to look after livestock. He receives 60 AZN monthly financial support from the government, but this is too low to cover his family's needs.\r\n\r\nShukur usually buys small cattle or lambs, raises and fattens them for five to six months, and resells them for a profitable price in the local livestock bazaar.  Milk and yoghurt he sells to the neighbors. Dairy and meat-selling brings 100 AZN income per month.\r\n\r\nMilk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolma, and always use yoghurt sauce. Milk products are considered to be very healthy and are also present in everyday life.   \r\n\r\nThis is the only financial income in his family and is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children. Shukur applied for a 1,500 AZN loan to purchase one cattle, one milking cow, five sheep, and fodder.

47, is single and lives with her parents. She is an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) and lives with her family in an IDP Settlement. \r\n\r\nSaadat is a farmer and raises seasonal fruits and vegetables. She has about 15 years of experience in this field, which makes her a skilled farmer. Saadat's monthly income is 70 AZN. Raising crops takes a lot of strength and work in the open air. This is hard work for Saadat, so her father helps her.\r\n\r\nSaadat usually sells her crop in the central bazaar. Fruits and vegetables are very popular in Azerbaijan. People consider fresh vegetables healthy and use them everyday in national dishes like pilau and dolma.

Besides, she has direct contact with people, since she's very friendly. She brings in innovative fashion articles and accessories and high quality clothing, and that's why she always has customers. In addition, the cosmetics she sells are very good and healing for her customers' skin. She hopes to someday set up a well-equipped store.\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP.

age 33, is an artisan. He lives in a village in the Tskaltubo district with his mother and two children. Koba\u2019s wife lives and works abroad to help her family financially. Koba keeps busy running the family's small-scale agricultural business. He sows maize on the family-owned land and sells an average of 600 kg per year. Also, he runs a poultry farm with 40 hens and turkeys and sells them seasonally. Koba has requested credit for the purpose of building a greenhouse. The new business will be an additional source of income for the family, which will allow them to combat the poverty in which they live. Koba\u2019s loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program offers business start-up capital and re-startup credit with generous lending conditions to country rural poor, who often do not have access to credit as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Koba will purchase materials for the greenhouse construction (iron pillars and polyethylene covering) and will then construct the greenhouse, where tomatoes, cucumbers and greens will be grown throughout the year. Koba will work in the greenhouse himself. He will sell the harvested products at the local open market. The income of the family will significantly increase and they will be able to improve their living

Inasmuch as Gevorg\u2019s tractor is worn out, now he needs a loan of about 1,000 US dollars, to repair it before the start of spring sowing.

I did not really undergo any actual training, but started carving bit by bit and sometimes sought help from my other colleagues. Sometimes I assisted them too. Eventually I became very skilled in carving and I then decided to settle for full time carving and depend solely on my own ideas to carve. Now I have assistants and I also train other carvers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to all of you for taking part in this microcredit.

With this, he will continue striving to make his greatest dream reality: to have a space of his own for his workshop and to be able to give his son a good profession.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1289564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"SANTIAGO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.160833 -72.257222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-05T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-07T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":71.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":70.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":75.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.19},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":91.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":94.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":98.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":102.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.84,"local_amount":137.11,"processed_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":141.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031884,"comment":null},{"amount":28.4,"local_amount":70.99,"processed_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":73.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776377,"comment":null},{"amount":30.02,"local_amount":75.05,"processed_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":77.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483194,"comment":null},{"amount":30.84,"local_amount":77.09,"processed_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":79.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889229,"comment":null},{"amount":32.47,"local_amount":81.19,"processed_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":83.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664140,"comment":null},{"amount":223.43,"local_amount":558.57,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":576.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778889,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T15:14:16Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:40:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":524645,"name":"Yesika Leonor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Yesika Leonor  es originaria del municipio de san Rafael del sur, su actividad comercial es venta de perfumes para dama, caballero y cosm\u00e9ticos, lo comercializa visitando a sus clientes en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n para ofrecerles el producto y si el cliente le gusta se lo compra y se lo pagan en cuotas quincenales o mensuales seg\u00fan su forma de recibir sus pagos los clientes.\n\nEs madre soltera, tiene dos hijas menores de edad una en edad escolar.\n\nEl dinero lo solicita para la compra de ladrillo, cemento y otra parte para la compra de perfumenes.\nMe siento muy bien trabajar con ustedes gracias a Ceprodel y kiva he podido salir adelante con mis hijas.\n","en":"Yesika Leonor is from the municipality of San Rafael del Sur and her commercial activity is selling perfume for women and men and cosmetics.

get ahead. She, together with her husband and three children, has known how to work the land planting and cultivating corn, beans, and rice. In addition to working the land, she also has a small business selling dairy products. She makes these by purchasing milk and producing by-products, such as cheese curd and butter, on a small scale. She then sells these to her neighbors and friends. \r\n\r\nShe was not able to study as her parents had limited resources, however, she was able to complete the fourth grade in primary school. She is proud of the fact that she has some basics, which has helped her to be able to read and write. She is grateful to her parents for their efforts in addition to the work they did because she inherited it from them. They taught her how to work the land as well as methods for planting and cultivation and she has made a living farming for more than 20 years now. She has her own small plot of land, which is a result of her work and effort, together with her husband and family. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Rosa is requesting help to be able to buy seeds, fertilizers and for some mechanization to be able to continue working planting and cultivating corn, beans, and rice. This will allow her to continue helping her husband with the household expenses and other necessities that come up on a daily basis like clothing, school, medicine, and food, among others. Farming is the only means of support for her and her family. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to make her business grow, helping her husband to expand to other areas so that they can make a better income. This will allow them to give their children a better education, which is the greatest tool, and they can use it to get good jobs, have a better quality of life, and will be able to get ahead. This way, they too will be able to achieve their dreams.\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1118.1,"image":{"id":1289395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds, fertilizer, and for farming mechanization to plant corn, beans, and rice.

The size of her existing food truck limited Abrahatsiyone\u2019s ability to offer more variety in her menu, like Ethiopian or Eritrean food and salads and soups. \r\n\r\nAbrahatsiyone decided that she needed to purchase a larger food truck to meet the requests of her customers. The total cost of the food truck is $20,000. Abrahatsiyone personally invested her own $10,000, and a loan of $10,000 will help her cover the entire cost of the new food truck.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, Abrahatsiyone operated the business entirely on her own. She realized that she could use some assistance to stock and set up her inventory in the food truck.

He has been buying and selling small livestock for more than 20 years and knows all aspects of this business very well. \r\n\r\nToji also grows vegetables such as potatoes, carrots and onions for the family's own consumption.  He gets everything he needs from his own garden and does not need to buy produce at the market.\r\n\r\nToji's only source of income is his animal husbandry business, and his earnings from this business are not bad.\r\n\r\nToji is planning to buy a few sheep.  He will fatten them before the spring and then resell them for a profit.

She works in agriculture, growing basic grains such as corn and beans.  She does this work together with her husband, and this is how they put bread on the table every day in their home.  Edith is an enterprising, hardworking and responsible woman.  She has always worked in agriculture so she know very well how to do it.  Every year she sells part of her harvest and keeps the rest for consumption.  In this way, little by little, she gets by and provides her family with the necessities.  Edith would like to increase her harvest, and so she made the decision to request a loan through INTEGRAL to invest in agricultural supplies such as: seeds, manure, insecticides, etc.  She also wants to rent a plot of land.  This is how she earns a living and provides their daily bread to her household.

When she used to work for a person when they made sewed products, she learned everything that she needs to know now. That is why she works doing this now, generating her own income so her family can be better off. She started her business more than 7 years ago and so far, it has grown, but not as much as she aspires to. In her productive process, she cuts and sews, fills and reinforces, because her main products are mattress covers, pillows, sheets and curtains. She starts her activity at six in the morning and works until 8 at night. She does her business in hotels, clinics, and residences. She buys her raw materials in stores in the center of town and pays upfront. Right now, she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy fabrics, runners, thread, fibers, foam, waterproof fabric and leathers. Her lingerie products are also useful in the market and fulfill her buyers; expectations of quality. That is why her main goals are oriented towards making her business grow, because a lot of customers ask her for items. However, her working capital is not enough to respond to her purposes of growth. Her goal for the future is it add better infrastructure with her machines. In the future, she wants to buy a house and have a vehicle to get around in and contact many more customers who will contribute to an increase in sales so she can make more day to day with a much better position in the changing market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1288908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy fabrics, runners, threads, fibers, foams, waterproof fabrics and leather.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-02-06T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-08T12:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":77924},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82309},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":84229},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":86194},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":88206},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90264},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":92370},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94525},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96731},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":98988},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":101298},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":106962}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.28,"local_amount":77924,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":78740.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498001,"comment":null},{"amount":46.76,"local_amount":82309,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83171.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527818,"comment":null},{"amount":47.86,"local_amount":84229,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85112.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928564,"comment":null},{"amount":48.97,"local_amount":86194,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":87097.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705714,"comment":null},{"amount":50.12,"local_amount":88206,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:45:04Z","rounded_local_amount":89130.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968003,"comment":null},{"amount":311.92,"local_amount":548981,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":554736.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817199,"comment":null},{"amount":75.09,"local_amount":132157,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":133542.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323474,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T15:08:26Z","paid_date":"2013-10-22T08:43:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":524687,"name":"Elinette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elinette, 42 years old, is married to a personal driver.

lives in the Nyamira area of Kenya, which is a popular banana growing region.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is 'quick returns on investments'. Her biggest challenge is sourcing for finances. The animals on the farm have been given the name Kitambaa. She will use the loan of 52,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nFlorence was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied because it is cheap. This client was also asked what she learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session and she answered 'loaning process.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Florence replied that it will increase her income.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Florence owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, solar power, TV, DVD' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

They have an average age of 43 and, on average, 5 children. They all live in the village of Noumou W\u00ear\u00ea in the S\u00e9gou region (4th administrative region of Mali) and got to know each other thanks to neighbourly and family relationships. They buy mortars and gourds which they engrave with nice slogans and motifs and resell. The members of the group decided to work together with Soro Yiriwaso in order to increase their business and are on their 14th group loan cycle.\n\nSafiatou (the woman standing on the far left of the photo) is well known in the village of Noumou W\u00ear\u00ea for her engraved mortars and gourds. She plans to use her loan to buy 80 gourds and 20 mortars from the markets in the surrounding villages of the S\u00e9gou region and at the M\u00e9dine market.

Her previous loan was a big help in her business and she was able to buy all the products she needed for her variety store. Her loan was also a big help in the education of her children and for providing for her family's everyday expenses. Celia's variety store has been running for three years now and continues to grow. Along with her husband, a businessman, she works hard to provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCelia is requesting another 40,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better as a greater variety will result in better profit. Celia will continue to use her business profits to help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and provide for her children\u2019s education. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Celia dreams of expanding her business as well as her husband's business.

She is 23 years old and married. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Helen is one of the many Iraqi women who are working from home, using their sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of their families.\r\n\r\nHelen has five years' experience with sewing and tailoring and would like to improve the services she can offer to her customers. One of her priorities is to replace her old sewing machine with a newer model. To be able to do more creative jobs, she would also like to buy an over machine and nice, quality fabrics and raw materials to work with. To be able to make these purchases, she took a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.
