Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Peter enjoys his work and fishing with friends.  Peter is an all-around handyman.  He does not fear any type of job.  Recently, he decided to make repairs on his house, specifically, to hang drywall on walls and the ceiling, and to update the floor with high quality laminate.  To achieve this, he needs 20,000 hryvni to purchase construction materials.  Peter is planning to give the two renovated rooms to his daughter, who is getting married soon.

Currently, the house in which she lives has stove heating, that is to say, Svetlana and her husband use coal and firewood. It is very expensive and ineffective. Svetlana and her husband want to install natural gas in their home (a gas line runs along their street) and acquire a gas boiler. For this reason, Svetlana is requesting a loan in the amount of 20,000 hryvnia. Natural gas heating wastes less energy, thus Svetlana will be able to reduce her energy expenses and decrease her family's expenditures on heating in the winter months."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":214.57,"image":{"id":1430191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to install natural gas heating in her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Melitopol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46.842222 35.373056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T09:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T09:00:01Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svetlana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":566.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":563.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":603.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":563.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":661.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":701.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":668.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":691.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":731.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":755.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":765.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":791.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":805.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":870.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":886.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":895.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":945.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":992.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":987.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1053.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1103.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1150.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1173.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.73},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.1,"local_amount":566.47,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":572.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874609,"comment":null},{"amount":69.77,"local_amount":563.79,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":569.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429523127,"comment":null},{"amount":74.7,"local_amount":603.62,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":609.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440006080,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-15T18:49:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607774,"name":"Jes\u00fas Emilio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jes\u00fas, a sus 60 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y padre de 2 hijos.

In order to supplement his family\u2019s earnings, Jes\u00fas also performs construction jobs on a sporadic basis.  During these moments, his family helps with managing the business.  \r\n\r\nJes\u00fas says that his main challenge is the lack of operating capital, which limits his inventory and results in lost sales because he lacks products.  Nonetheless, this does not discourage him.  On the contrary, he is motivated to look for ways to move forward with his business.  For this reason, Jes\u00fas is requesting a loan so that he can buy merchandise in bulk (grains, pastas, pastries, sodas, cold cuts, dairy products, and other items).  This will enable him to have a wider variety of products on hand that he can offer to his customers.  As a result, he will be able to improve his sales and his income so that he can continue covering basic household needs.  \r\n\r\nJes\u00fas dreams of expanding his store, stocking his business with more products, and increasing his clientele.  This will guarantee favorable financial stability so that he can improve his family\u2019s well-being.  In the near future, he would like to enjoy the fruits of his hard labor along with his loved ones.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":191.01,"image":{"id":1431043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy grains, pastas, pastries, sodas, cold cuts, dairy products, and other items in bulk.

She has been selling cosmetics and perfumes out of a catalogue for 25 years. She sells both door-to-door, in various neighbourhoods of her city, where she has loyal customers who order from her time and time again, and at her home. She attributes the loyalty of her customer base to her amiability and pleasant attitude. Aida is a responsible person who wants to always do her best. She also sells clothing, both used and new, as well as new shoes for women.

The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination.  \n\nIn Mwembe B, 17 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Jesicah has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

She appreciates the benefits accruing from the use of solar lanterns, and with the Kiva financing option from Brazafric, she is seeking financing to purchase solar lanterns for stocking and reselling to her community. \r\n\r\nPenina points out that she would buy some solar lanterns for her grandchildren to ease and increase their study sessions and also for her shop to increase her working hours."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1428461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"TO BUY SOLAR LANTERNS.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NUU-KITUI","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":213,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Penina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":174600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":29100},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":29100},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":29100},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":29100},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":29100},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":29100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T15:12:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606191,"name":"Espoir Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr WENDINMI repr\u00e9sente le groupe ESPOIR.

story of Junita, daughter of Rohyati:\r\n\r\nI love Social Knowledge, because I like to study history. By learning history, I know the history of my nation and also other nations around the world. I have a little trouble about the way to school and to go home. If I go home rather late, it\u2019s hard to find public transportation so I walk instead. My hometown is far from school but I have no choice. Having new friends and teachers makes me glad. \r\n\r\nAs a Moslem, I spend my spare time learing more about the Qur\u2019an and other knowledge about Islam. I can manage my time well, for study and extra-curricular activities. We rent a house because we have not had our own house yet. I usually go to school on foot, but if I wake up late, I go by bus. I am afraid the gate of my school will be closed. \r\n\r\nTo KIVA lenders, I am very grateful. Your help is useful for me. I live in Jeruklegi Wetan Village, Jeruklegi Subdistrict, Cilacap Regency, Mid Java Province, Indonesia. The condition of my village is not modern, The road is mud and soil, with many trees and hilly. My parents earn money from their small business. Their salary is not fixed; it is about Rp. 700,000\/month.\r\n\r\n The number of children in my family is three. They are: me \/ the oldest ( 15 years old ), Rizal ( 9 years old ), and Lutfi ( 4 years old ). Only me and my younger brother,  Rizal, are students. With this loan I can lighten the financial burden of my family. In this school, I learn accounting as my major. To be a good and successful accountant is my dream. It is a pleasure for me to learn new knowledge that I haven\u2019t learned before.

is 53 years old from the village of Nagomari. She is a mother of two grown children who are students and live in the capital city separately. Ineza lives with her husband and her mother-in-law. \r\n\r\nThey are running an agricultural business and grow maize and nuts on the family-owned plot of land. Besides, Ineza has a dairy cow and sells cheese products locally. Unfortunately, the existing income is not enough to make ends meet for the family. So Ineza decided to start a trading business with a loan. But the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Ineza\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Startup Program gives vulnerable poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of 3,600 GEL, she will purchase second-hand clothing and shoes at wholesale prices and sell it in her community.

Thanks to that, today she has coffee crops and cattle and pigs to raise with which she earns the money to pay for her household's basic needs.\r\n\r\nWith care and dedication Mar\u00eda has been able to overcome various obstacles that have come up, especially with the high cost of agricultural inputs and the veterinary products she needs to take care of her animals.  This doesn't hold her back, though, because with her enterprising spirit she always finds a way to continue making progress.\r\n\r\nThis brings Mar\u00eda to request the loan as support for continuing with her job.  With the money she'll buy calves and piglets to raise and fatten for later sale.\r\n\r\nShe'll be able to increase her production and improve the household income, which will allow her to strengthen her business and stagger production to guarantee that she constantly has money coming in.  This way she can continue to look out for the welfare of her children and have better living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":196.99,"image":{"id":1434058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy calves and piglets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T15:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T15:30:10Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":89650},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":92136},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":94691},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":97316},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100015},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":102788},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":105638},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":108568},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":111578},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":114672},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":117852},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":121120},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":124478},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":127930},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":131477},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":135123},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":138870},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":142720},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":146678},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150745},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154925},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":159221},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":163636},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":168173}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.07,"local_amount":89670,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":90131.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807497,"comment":null},{"amount":49.83,"local_amount":94908,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":95396.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095590,"comment":null},{"amount":54.05,"local_amount":102946,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":103476.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074641,"comment":null},{"amount":46.04,"local_amount":87694,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":88145.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009839,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T20:31:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606754,"name":"Theresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"41-year-old Theresa is from Liberia.

They work hard and always have high quality wine, which is sold to local retailers for a good price. \r\n\r\n As the family has only seasonal income, Zviad decided to start his own business and seek for credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 2500 Gel.\r\n\r\n With the received credit, Zviad will build a greenhouse.

They have an average age of 37 years, are married, and have at least 4 children each. The women in the group are in various businesses, including spices, fruits, vegetables, soaps, etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the size of their businesses, the members of the group decided to partner with Soro Yiriwaso's loan program. They are on their second group loan. \r\n\r\nAwa, a member of the Danaya group, is pictured seated in front, on the left hand side. She plans to use her loan to purchase soaps (for bathing and laundry.) She obtains these products in the big market in Koutiala from Ghanaian sellers. She sells them at retail for cash from her house and in the market to a customer base made up exclusively of women. Awa hopes to earn a monthly profit of 30,000 francs CFA during this loan period. In additional to paying back the interest, the group will use a portion of the profits earned to provide for their personal needs and increase their business capital."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":416.67,"image":{"id":1429339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase soaps","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Niagaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanouya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niagaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":51311.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207746,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":51311.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972440,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":51311.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624991,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":51311.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851000,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T23:04:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606781,"name":"Yen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yen, 55 years old, is married and has three children, two sons and one daughter.

All of her life she has been a housewife, but 3 years ago she decided to set up her own business with the aim of contributing to the household finances. She opened up a shop near to where she lives, which allows her to look after everything at home as well as being easy to get to. In her shop she sells fizzy drinks, cakes and cleaning products among other things, but there are many products which her customers ask for which she does not have, due to a lack of working capital, so she has lost some sales. \r\n\r\nThis has led her to ask for the loan as support for continuing with her business. With the money she wants to buy an assortment of groceries wholesale (pulses, pasta, rice, dairy products, eggs and other items), which will give her the opportunity to increase her range and give her customers a wider variety of products. This will be directly reflected in an increase in sales and the income she gets from her work. \r\n\r\nBlanca dreams of making her business grow into a minimarket, with a very good range, and where she can continue providing work for her younger son who has worked with her since the opening of the shop.

Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1429498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buys fertilizer and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sangita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2561.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410196605,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-25T09:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2561.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419960057,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2561.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429613950,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2561.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840412,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T17:13:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608860,"name":"Luciano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luciano tiene 63 a\u00f1os, para poder salir adelante trabaja como obrero en un fundo agr\u00edcola, en el cual labora alrededor de 8 horas al d\u00eda, con el fruto de su trabajo solventa los gastos de su hogar con mucho esfuerzo; el cree que est\u00e1 saliendo adelante porque se esfuerza mucho y es responsable en su trabajo.\n\nLuciano est\u00e1 muy agradecido con los prestamistas kiva ya que gracias a la ayuda que le han brindado  podr\u00e1 comprar materiales para poder mejorar su vivienda, la cual se encuentran en malas condiciones actualmente, as\u00ed el podr\u00e1 mejorar su calidad de vida y seguir luchando para hacer realidad su sue\u00f1o:\u201d Terminar de construir su vivienda\u201d.\n","en":"Luciano is 63 years old.

It is composed of members who run small businesses as well as practice farming.\r\nTeresa, the group chair (far left in the photo) is a small-scale farmer who grows maize, sorghum and millet. She runs a hardware store whose income contributes to the family needs such as food, school fees and taking care of their very poor neighbors. She joined Big Vision group early last year to empower her day-to-day life and business through affordable credit and to access solar lamps and cook stoves which proves efficient in her area since they save on fuel costs. Teresa had previously accessed her first loan with the group which she used to start up the business and has successfully repaid the loan.\r\nThis year, she sold her farm produce at good prices and used the money to meet the family\u2019s basic needs. Income from her hardware business paid school fees for her two children in high school. After repaying the first loan, she came up with the idea of stocking the business with solar lamps and energy-saving cook stoves.

She indicates that she\u2019s been part of Pro Mujer for ten years having joined thanks to an invitation from a friend who is a member of the institution.  She currently works selling meat, a business she learned 30 years ago when she noticed that her area needed a butcher.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019ll take out now is to increase capital.  She will buy a meat grinder from wholesalers in the city of El Alto and then install in in her sales space.  This way of working makes it possible for her to generate income needed to support her home as best as possible for she\u2019s in a common law relationship and has five children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers the health area and spending time with her fellow members.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3978.46,"image":{"id":1434166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a meat grinder.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":6175,"lender_count":136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ssucy Bertha\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorotea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Efigenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Efrena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":42576,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":6175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3124.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3332.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3378.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3424.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3471},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3518.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3614.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3663.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3713.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3764.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4002.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":453.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":483.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":489.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":496.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":503.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":517.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":524.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":538.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":545.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":580.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1923.29,"local_amount":13260.92,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":13289.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153719,"comment":null},{"amount":1013.7,"local_amount":6989.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7004.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615291,"comment":null},{"amount":1041.47,"local_amount":7180.84,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":7196.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736231,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-08T09:08:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606816,"name":"Hoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hoa is 54 years old and is married.

is 30 years old. She is married and has one 5-year-old child. \r\n\r\nMany years ago, Sinita established a cow's milk selling business. Working 7 days a week and 4 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans from Patan BPW.  Sinita will use this loan to buy a young dairy cow. \r\n\r\nIn the future Sinita plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.

She sells various items like eggs, biscuits, detergent, cooking oil, soft drinks, shampoo, and vinegar. She requested a loan of 6,000 PHP to buy soft drinks, sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce.

He lives with his common-law companion.\r\n\r\nIn his work life Luis has made a living on various farms in the area where he lives.  About 10 years ago, however, he decided to go out on his own and set up a grocery store where he works every day from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m.  This is how he earns enough money to support his household.\r\n\r\nLuis is a thriving, persevering, and kind man.  He works with care to get his business ahead, overcoming various difficult moments, especially the public type of problems that come up and affect his sales and, consequently, his income.  This didn't get in the way of his perseverance, however, and little by little the situation has improved.\r\n\r\nThis is what motivates Luis to request the loan he wants to invest in buying stock wholesale (oil, cleaning products, grains, pasta, pastry, cookies, canned goods, and other products).  He also wants to buy display cases and shelves to improve the storage capacity of his business and offer a greater variety of products to satisfy his customers' tastes and needs.\r\n\r\nThis way Luis will increase his sales and his income, and have the possibility of moving toward his dream of expanding his business and having it well stocked.  This will generate greater income for him, and he and his family will enjoy a better quality of life and well-being.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":145.38,"image":{"id":1434023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Montel\u00edbano","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":89650},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":92136},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":94691},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":97316},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100015},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":102788},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":105638},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":108568},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":111578},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":114672},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":117852},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":121120},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":124478},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":127930},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":131477},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":135123},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":138870},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":142720},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":146678},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150745},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154925},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":159221},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":163636},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":168173}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.47,"local_amount":181840,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":182776.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095589,"comment":null},{"amount":49.91,"local_amount":95075,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":95564.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009838,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T18:09:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609420,"name":"D\u00fao La Bendicion Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao la Bendicion este grupo esta conformado por la se\u00f1ora Ana Brenda de 40 a\u00f1os de edad ella se dedica a la venta de productos de consumo diario le da gracias a Dios por la oportunidad de tener su tienda ya que por medio del negocio a podido tener nuevas oportunidades para sus hijos, es por eso que esta solicitando este credito para la compra de mas mercaderia en productos de consumo diario para la venta esperando que ustedes le puedan ayudar, y le pide a Dios para que ustedes esten bien y sigan ayudando a las personas que lo nececitan.","en":"\u201cLa Bendici\u00f3n\u201d (The Blessing) Duo\r\n\r\nAna Brenda, 40, is part of this duo and she works selling basic staple goods.

is a young farmer from Muranga County, in central Kenya. He practices zero grazing on his five acres of land. He is also a coffee farmer and a father of three. \r\n\r\nIncome from coffee and milk sales is barely enough to take care of all his family needs, such as paying school fees for his children, food, and medication. The costs of fuel and farm inputs are also a burden for the family, which uses firewood and charcoal for cooking and kerosene for lighting.\r\n\r\nSammy opted for a biogas loan from Visionary Empowerment Programme (VEP). With biogas, Sammy would save money on lighting and cooking. Time consumed in firewood collection will be saved and he will get more time to spend with his family.\r\n\r\nSammy's coffee farm will also benefit from the bio-slurry, hence saving him the cost of fertilizer. With a size 12m3 biogas plant, he will easily commercialize it and supply energy to his neighbors, at a cost. Hence, he will be in a better position to repay the loan. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":143.76,"image":{"id":1429556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to construct a bio-digester on his farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T19:00:07Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sammy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4159}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":8334,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8395.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429639969,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4197.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867630,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T23:34:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606837,"name":"Jyanti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jyanti is 38 years old.

Only three of them are attending school. \r\n\r\nFor five years now she has been selling charcoal. She learned how to do this business from her mother and the best part of her work is that it keeps her busy. She sells for six days a week, spending 10 hours each day.  She mostly uses taxis to get her goods to her shop. She is glad today that she is independent. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to purchase charcoal by bags to increase her sales.

tiempo. Desde hace 20 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de comidas r\u00e1pidas, inicialmente colabor\u00e1ndole a su madre a prepararlas, as\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 gran parte de lo que hoy sabe y, desde hace 2 a\u00f1os inici\u00f3 su propio negocio vendiendo patacones, chuzos y comidas r\u00e1pidas en general, cuenta con el apoyo de una de sus hijas y, con las ganancias que obtiene  lleva el sustento a su hogar y solventa los gastos b\u00e1sicos de la familia. Ella trabaja en el negocio de Viernes a Domingo y los dem\u00e1s d\u00edas de la semana alterna esta actividad trabajando como empleada de oficios varios en diferentes casas, as\u00ed complementa la entrada de dinero al hogar. Las ventas en el negocio en algunos momentos se han visto afectadas porque en el barrio donde reside se presentan algunos problemas de orden p\u00fablico y enfrentamientos entre bandas criminales del sector, sin embargo, Zulima no se desanima, por el contrario se caracteriza por ser una mujer din\u00e1mica, alegre y emprendedora, le gusta lo que hace ya que con su trabajo ha logrado sacar adelante a sus hijas, quienes son el motor principal de su vida. Esto la motiva a solicitar el ciclo de cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de un carro de comidas r\u00e1pidas y surtido en general (salsas, carnes fr\u00edas, panes, gaseosas), esto le permitir\u00e1 ampliar su capacidad instalada con la que podr\u00e1 dejar de preparar los alimentos en la cocina de su casa y, adem\u00e1s podr\u00e1 tener disponibilidad de insumos suficientes para satisfacer los diversos gustos de los comensales. Esto se reflejar\u00e1 en el aumento de las ventas y los ingresos, con los cuales pretende cumplir el sue\u00f1o de adquirir un local propio en un futuro a mediano plazo, en el que pueda ofrecer mayor variedad de productos y sus clientes puedan estar m\u00e1s c\u00f3modos, adem\u00e1s desea generar empleo; de esta manera podr\u00e1 mejorar las condiciones de vida y disfrutar de un mejor bienestar al lado de sus hijas.  ","en":"Zulima, 44, is mother of two daughters and has been head of household since her husband died some time ago.  She\u2019s sold fast-food for the last 20 years.  Initially her mother helped her make it and that\u2019s how she learned most of what she knows today.  For the last two years she\u2019s been in business for herself selling fried banana chips, meat kebabs and fast-food in general.  One of her daughters helps her and she uses profits earned to support her home and cover basic family expenses.  She works in her business Friday to Sunday and the other days of the week works as a domestic employee in various houses; this is how she adds to her household income. \r\n\r\nSales in her business have been somewhat affected lately because her neighborhood has had some public order problems and clashes between rival criminal gangs in the area.  Nevertheless, Zulima does not become discouraged.  On the contrary, she\u2019s known to be dynamic, cheerful and enterprising.  She likes what she does because she\u2019s succeeded in raising her daughters, who are her main priority, thanks to her work.\r\n\r\nThis has motivated her to request a loan cycle to buy a fast-food cart and to stock up on supplies (sauces, cold cuts, bread, soft-drinks) which will make it possible for her to increase her capacity and to be able to stop producing the food in her home kitchen.  She will also have sufficient amounts of the necessary ingredients on hand to meet the various tastes of her diners.\r\n\r\nThis will be reflected in higher sales and income that she intends to use to reach her dream of acquiring a locale of her own in the future medium run so that she can offer greater variety of products and her customers can be more comfortable.  Also, she\u2019d like to generate employment and be able to improve her living conditions and to enjoy better well-being in company of her daughters.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":145.62,"image":{"id":1434223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a fast-food cart and supplies for it.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulima Janneth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":65386},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":67199},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":69063},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":70978},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":72946},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":74969},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77047},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79184},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81380},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83636},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85955},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":88339},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90788},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":93306},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":95893},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":98552},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":101285},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":104094}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.87,"local_amount":65409,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":66789.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807498,"comment":null},{"amount":36.27,"local_amount":68007,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":69442.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095592,"comment":null},{"amount":38.62,"local_amount":72411,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:57Z","rounded_local_amount":73939.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074643,"comment":null},{"amount":35.86,"local_amount":67229,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":68647.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009841,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T03:56:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609427,"name":"Mar\u00eda Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adem\u00e1s de dedicarse a las labores del hogar, Mar\u00eda Luisa tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 desde peque\u00f1a al lado de su padre.

She's requesting a loan to cover her expenses.  This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Ana Diomaira.  I'm 19 years old.  I was born in Guacao, La Vega, and grew up and live in Jamo, La Vega.  I have two siblings and I'm single and have no children.  My mother's a homemaker and my father's an independent worker.\r\n\r\nI study nursing at the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Tecnol\u00f3gica del Cibao (UCATECI).  I love it because I want to immerse myself in the field of health and the possibility of curing other people.  I took 90% of the required courses in high school, including ecology, environmental studies, Dominican history, introduction to computer science, professional ethics, etc.\r\n\r\nI need the loan for the following reasons: low economic resources, the inability of my parents to cover the household needs, and because I want to secure the stability of my educational program.  If I were not to receive this loan, I would be in a big predicament and my possibilities for advancement would be reduced.  I'd try to find a solution, however, and not stay at a standstill permanently.\r\n\r\nMy academic goals are to educate myself deeply in everything that is nursing so I can make the most of the knowledge I acquire in my program.  My family goals, on the other hand, are to contribute to my family's health through the resources I acquire and through my potential in the health field.  Among my personal goals are to grow professionally and to always be ready when it comes time to help any patient, regardless of race, gender, and social status.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing this program, I would think about putting into practice all my acquired knowledge to achieve my goals.  I would be grateful to this program for what I've learned because I'm planning to study medicine after this.  Finally, I want to work as a nurse while I educate myself more in the field of medical-surgical care.\r\n\r\nNot having anything more to say I'll take my leave, hoping you'll understand this application in the nicest possible way.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1434114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

After the death of her husband, she was left alone to raise three children and to run her homestead. Gulbara has a high school education. As a main source of income for her family, Gulbara is engaged in raising livestock, having started 24 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 1,000 som KGS. Thanks to Gulbara's hard work, she today has on her homestead: two dairy cows and 20 sheep.

To achieve his goal, Deyvid has enrolled in the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Juan Misael Saracho. He expects to graduate in January 2014, but without a loan he is unsure how he will be able to continue affording his education. He shares that his alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until he could return. Deyvid shares that it is important to him to graduate on time so he can enter into the job market as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWith a this loan, Deyvid plans on purchasing his much needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Deyvid feels he will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. Deyvid currently works 30 hours a week.

Gulayim has a professional degree and raises livestock as a main source of income for her family. She started her business 10 years ago, using 10,000 som (KGS) to purchase cattle. Because to her hard work Gulayim now owns two milk cows and five sheep and the business makes 5,000 som (KGS) a month. In order to expand her business Gulayim has turned to the micro-loan bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 20,000 som (KGS). She will use the money to purchase sheep. She plans to use the profits from the expansion to buy even more animals and hopes to save enough to buy a

on cloth or on alabaster. They are all different, but one thing unites them: Freedom of expression. One of these people is Abdukarim. He lives in the Qurgan-Tube region. He creates his paintings though engraving them on the sides of the national crib, which he produces himself, with his own hands.\r\n\r\nAbdukarim is a master in his work. His engravings are masterpieces of art. Abdukarim loves his work and strives for each subsequent piece of work being better than the previous.

","en":"Ranogul is 51 years old. She was born in Vahdat which is located in south-western Tajikistan. Ranogul lives with her son and daughter, while her husband is a migrant worker in Russia. Even though he is far away, Ranogul's husband never forgets about his family and he loves them all dearly: his beautiful daughter - mother's helper, his son - the man of the house and his beautiful wife who waits for him at home. While Ranogul's husband is away, she tries her best to provide her children with all the necessities. Ranogul works in a fashion studio as a seamstress. She started working in this area when she turned 40 years old. Ranogul can sew, draft and design new patterns, and her clothes make others happy. The best reward for Ranogul is to see the excited expressions on the faces of her clients when they try on her designs.  Ranogul has been working as a seamstress and fashion designer for 11 years. She still takes her orders through the fashion studio, but wants to also be able to work at home, so that she can be close to her children. The sewing machine that Ranogul uses in the studio belongs to the studio. So that she can buy her own sewing machine and all the accessories and be able to continue working while home Ranogul needs money, but all her income is spent on her family. That is why Ranogul decided to take out this loan. She wants to work and better provide for her children and also be near them."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":212.78,"image":{"id":1430304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

He is 40 years old. For the last five years Boturjon has worked as a manager of the local school. However, the main source of income is Boturjon's livestock business. In Tajikistan the salaries of school teachers and school staff are miniscule. His salary as a manger would not allow Boturjon to feed his large family - his aging parents, his stay-at-home wife and four young children. Most of Boturjon's time is spent with his livestock, taking care of the cows, goats and baby lambs. He has learned to take good care of his animals from his father and grandfather and has been using those lessons for 25 years. He is still thanks full to his elders for the knowledge. Boturjon owns only a few heads of cattle and wants to breed them, so he has decided to take out this loan.

She has a professional degree but makes her living raising livestock. She started five years ago with 10,000 som (KGS) and now owns two milk cows and five sheep. The milk and meat sales allow Boldu to earn 5,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to buy another cow she has turned to the micro-lending bank \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS).

She lives with them in a town on the shore of the Caribbean. In 1995, when she accompanied a friend to buy varied merchandise to sell in another department of the Colombian Caribbean, she realized that it was a very good business and she started to sell groceries directly to the residents of the town where she lives. She does her business now on credit every day from 8 in the morning until 6 i the evening. She pays for her merchandise upfront in granaries and stores and warehouses in the department of  La Guajira in northern Colombia. Her main customers are people she knows and retirees whom she has won over little by little, and with whom she has been able to grow her business. Her goal for the future is to open her locale to the public and remodel her store. Her biggest challenge is increasing sales.

She lives on her own without her husband and has two children in her care. Sabohat lives in a small rural village. She works as a teacher in a local school. But living on a teacher's salary is very difficult and she lacks the money for even basic food. Her children need good nutrition to grow healthy and developed. Sabohat therefore is doing everything possible to somehow find more income for a decent living. \r\n\r\nMost recently, she decided to start her own business which will bring her a good steady income. And as a hardworking woman, her choice stopped on raising livestock and horticulture, because from childhood she knows the ins and outs of these activities. But in order to start this business, she needs some amount of money that she does not currently have. She decided therefore to take a loan to start a business. She will purchase small calves, then grow them and sell the meat and milk from the grown cattle. \r\n\r\nIn this way, she will have a steady income that will help her to improve her quality of life. To obtain a loan to buy cattle, Sabohat turned to Arvand. She is waiting and hoping for a positive result, and thank Arvand in advance for the help."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":136.24,"image":{"id":1429954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to
