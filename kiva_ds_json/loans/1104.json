In the future, he dreams of having his own farm with several professionally-cared-for crops to distribute to large buyers.  Jos\u00e9 is single.  He finished high school and he lives with his parents Jos\u00e9 and Elvira in Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pichincha, one of the largest provinces in the Republic of Ecuador.  This canton is located a few kilometers from the city of Quito and has a diversity of forests.  In addition, its neighborhoods are populated with friendly people and typical customs of the city where there are also several small businesses established, run by the entrepreneurs who fight each day to make their dreams a reality.  Other outstanding activities are agriculture and livestock farming, producing abundant crops that are then sold to distribute around to many provinces.  It also has several tourist attractions like waterfalls, rivers, trails and spas where the tourist is attracted by the adventure sports that are sold there with guaranteed security.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has worked raising cattle for milk production for 2 years, an activity that he inherited from his parents who, since he was a child, taught him the labors of cleanliness, care, feeding and milking of the cows.  Now it is an activity that he carries out full time, nine hours each day to which he puts a lot of effort and dedication in order to deliver a healthy product to his customers.  This young entrepreneur is requesting a loan that he will use to buy a pair of young cows to produce more liters of milk a day and thus he will be able to increase his milk sales, which will generate for him a better profit with which he will be able to help his parents with the household expenses and also be able to continue preparing for when he has his own farm to be able to run it professionally.  Jos\u00e9 encourages everyone that can hear about his story through Kiva to contribute with a small grain of sand so that his project can be a reality.  He is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who, in the pursuit of the mission to end poverty in Ecuador, provides so much support to the entrepreneurs and small-businesspeople of the rural areas, with training, personalized counseling and that familial bond that leads to attending to a customer not only with financial services but also non-financial services that ensure the well-being of the

She is the mother of five children and is motivated to provide for her family.

She buys her stock from wholesalers in Koutiala, and she conducts her sales for cash out of her shop in Koutiala KoKo to a mixed clientele. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to earn a monthly profit of 40,000 FCFA, which she will use to repay the interest on the loan from Soro Yiriwaso, to meet the needs of her family, and to invest in her activity.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":190.91,"image":{"id":1339201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy staples for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-24T16:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-24T16:40:10Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diamado ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819647,"comment":null},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678544,"comment":null},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924173,"comment":null},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207374,"comment":null},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972023,"comment":null},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624690,"comment":null},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850726,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-24T18:36:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":550752,"name":"Ngailut Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twelve hardworking tribal women form the \u201cNgailut Lom\u201d group; it means \u201cLove Group\u201d. \r\n\r\nLhingngah is the featured borrower, and she is pictured with her hand raised.

She is pictured with her hand raised. She is 60 years old and has four sons and two daughters. She is quite old yet she is strong willed. She is a loving mother. Her husband serves as a priest in the village where she lives.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Nenglhing used to buy vegetables from the surrounding villages and sell them in the market. She could make some earnings out of this but the earnings were too small. Apart from the small earnings she made, the job she had taken up was threatening her health because she could not have her meals on time and she had to travel long distances. So she decided to change her business from buying and selling vegetables to raising piglets and selling full grown pigs. By doing this, she needs not go from one place to another and she can keep herself healthy and make more earnings.\r\n\r\nNenglhing now wants to buy more piglets and builds a better pigsty. For this, she needs a sufficient amount of money. So she wants to avail a loan from Kiva through WSDS.

For social reasons, Fatoumata did not have an opportunity to receive an education, which is why she started earning a living from an early age on. After having tried various business activities without success, some years ago she ended up launching a business buying and reselling firewood and charcoal. In order to satisfy the volume of customer demand and expand the business, three years ago she decided to reach out to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Paul replied 'Help pay school fees.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Paul owns the following: 'a cow, poultry, and a bicycle' but does not own 'a pig, a pump, a motorcycle, or an automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household  'a mosquito net and solar power' but does not have 'electricity, running water, a sewing machine, a TV, or a DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":413.04,"image":{"id":1336108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3311.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3399.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3488.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3581.23},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3675.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3772.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3872.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3974.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4080.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4187.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4298.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4412.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4528.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4648.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4771.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.25,"local_amount":3414,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3457.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768748,"comment":null},{"amount":42.34,"local_amount":3504.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:15:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3548.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516868,"comment":null},{"amount":43.46,"local_amount":3596.87,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3642.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960482,"comment":null},{"amount":44.61,"local_amount":3691.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3738.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820134,"comment":null},{"amount":45.79,"local_amount":3789.54,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3837.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417227,"comment":null},{"amount":95.24,"local_amount":7882.24,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":7981.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980776,"comment":null},{"amount":49.52,"local_amount":4098.06,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4149.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529382,"comment":null},{"amount":50.83,"local_amount":4206.39,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4259.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753348,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T08:32:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":550938,"name":"Ayisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ayisa is married with one child who attends school.

His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. They have a milk cow and pigs. The cow is milked every day to make cheese and from the pigs they get piglets. The family also owns a vineyard and they make vodka. All the products and piglets are sold locally at the markets. In addition, Tamaz has a truck and he is working on private orders to transport different cargo to earn a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nTamaz requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Tamaz will purchase pottery and wooden wares from the wholesalers at a low cost. He already has a commercial space in the center of a local market which he will use as a shop. The products will be sold with a price markup from his shop and Tamaz will earn additional income for his family. He will reinvest part of the profit in the same business and use another part for his family's well-being. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":580.55,"image":{"id":1336141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase pottery and wooden wares from the wholesalers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Dzirula","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T03:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T03:50:08Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamaz ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104.61},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":109.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":113.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":118.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":126.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":130.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":133.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":137.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":142.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":145.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.51,"local_amount":104.61,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:57Z","rounded_local_amount":106.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969187,"comment":null},{"amount":67.27,"local_amount":109.08,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":111.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749607,"comment":null},{"amount":69.97,"local_amount":113.48,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":115.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613513,"comment":null},{"amount":71.28,"local_amount":115.58,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":117.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857230,"comment":null},{"amount":73.36,"local_amount":118.96,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":121.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133883,"comment":null},{"amount":76.05,"local_amount":123.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":125.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107470,"comment":null},{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":126.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":128.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255019,"comment":null},{"amount":80.39,"local_amount":130.37,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019169,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T01:29:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":552826,"name":"Brehima","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Brehima est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 41 ans et vit avec sa femme et ses  6 enfants dans la ville de Koutiala. \nBrehima a pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole pour s\u2019int\u00e9resser aux activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus depuis son enfance aupr\u00e8s de ses fr\u00e8res.

is 40 years old. She lives in the Batumi district with her mother, brother, sister-in-law and an infant nephew. Irine has requested a loan for her family business start-up from local financial institutions several times, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nIrine\u2019s brother works as an artisan and her sister-in-law works at a local restaurant as a waitress. They both earn a small monthly income. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo's estimates, the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-ups credit with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit Irine will purchase a car. After purchasing a car, she will be able to supply her newly opened restaurant with supplies. Irine has chosen a very good place in the centre of Batumi, where a large number of people live. She hopes the business will be profitable.

is 53 years old. He lives in the Batumi city with his 46-year-old wife, Rusudan, and two children, who are students. Genadi requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGenadi has a car-washing service. Along with washing the cars from the outside, they also wash carpets and get a small monthly income. Rusudan is working as a lecturer at the local university and she is also working part-time at the local children's clinic as a nurse. The total family income is rarely enough to cover their expenses. \r\n\r\nGenadi requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Genadi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Genadi will purchase a vacuum cleaner and also make an advertising banner for his washing service center. With the vacuum cleaner, Genadi will be able to offer better service to his customers and wash the cars not only from outside, but also clean them from inside. With the poster, he will be able to attract more clients, and this will significantly increase his income. Increased income will help Genadi to cover the family monthly expenses and also provide for his children's studies.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":821.36,"image":{"id":1336160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase a vacuum cleaner and also make an advertising banner for his car-washing service center.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Batumi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T04:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T04:30:10Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":96.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":99.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":101.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":103.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":109.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":112.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":114.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":117.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":121.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":124.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.62,"local_amount":91.62,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":91.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969189,"comment":null},{"amount":96.15,"local_amount":96.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":96.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749609,"comment":null},{"amount":99.56,"local_amount":99.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":99.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613515,"comment":null},{"amount":101.2,"local_amount":101.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":101.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857232,"comment":null},{"amount":103.82,"local_amount":103.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":103.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133885,"comment":null},{"amount":107.17,"local_amount":107.17,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":107.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107472,"comment":null},{"amount":109.26,"local_amount":109.26,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":109.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255020,"comment":null},{"amount":112.58,"local_amount":112.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":112.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019170,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T14:24:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":550970,"name":"Tumaini","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tumaini is a resident of Kongowea, Kenya.

Kellen is 18 years old and lives in the town of Mubende in the Mubende region of Uganda. For the past year, Kellen has been working hard to manage her small market, where she sells fresh foods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Kellen has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food, such as raw bananas and cassava, to sell. This will help Kellen to generate greater profits and improve her family's standards of living. Kellen hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a very big retail shop. \r\n\r\nKellen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Sarah has been working hard to manage her stationery shop. \r\nTo help expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more stationery items such as books, pens, staples and computer accessories, and will help Sarah to generate greater profits and improve her family's living standard. Sarah hopes that in the future she will be able to have a very good stable financial life. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Javis is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kisekende in the Mubende region of Uganda. For the past six months, Javis has been working hard to manage her small clothing business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Javis has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy different types of clothes to sell, and will help Javis to generate greater profits and take care of her young siblings. Javis hopes that in the future she will be able to own a big boutique shop. \r\n\r\nJavis is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past year, Janet has been working hard to manage her small clothing business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Janet has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes to sell, and will help Janet to generate greater profits and take care of her young siblings. Janet hopes that in the future she will be able to own a big boutique shop. \r\n\r\nJanet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Annet has been working hard to manage her small farming business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Annet has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more seeds for planting since it\u2019s a rainy season, and will help Annet to generate greater profits and boost her business and even open up a retail shop. Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Hellen has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells local brew. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hellen has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more sorghum and millet for making the local brew to sell, and will help Hellen to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Hellen hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own. \r\n\r\nHellen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is 17 years old and lives in the town of Iganga in the Iganga region of Uganda. For the past three years, Sumaya has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells rice, juice, cooking oil and beans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sumaya has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more maize flour, rice, cooking oil and juice for the shop to sell, and will help Sumaya to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Sumaya hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nSumaya is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Hadija has been working hard to manage her small charcoal store. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hadija has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more sacks of charcoal to sell, and will help Hadija to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young child. Hadija hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nHadija is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

This will make it possible for him to continue striving to make his greatest dream a reality: to buy a piece of land and have his own house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1336867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enrique Roberto Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":140.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":143.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":151.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":155.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":161.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":169.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":174.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":182.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":188.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":203.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":133.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":136.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483435,"comment":null},{"amount":56.34,"local_amount":140.86,"processed_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":144.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889515,"comment":null},{"amount":57.59,"local_amount":143.96,"processed_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":147.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664412,"comment":null},{"amount":60.62,"local_amount":151.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":155.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775853,"comment":null},{"amount":62.18,"local_amount":155.45,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":159.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779128,"comment":null},{"amount":64.6,"local_amount":161.49,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":165.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054311,"comment":null},{"amount":445.34,"local_amount":1113.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1140.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819228,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T22:48:54Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":552875,"name":"Alimatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e vers 1972 \u00e0 Bougouni, Madame Alimatou est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 5 enfants.

She lives with her children at her husband's house in the Massablacoura neighborhood of Bougouni. Not having gone to school, she very quickly got started earning a living. \r\n\r\nMariam first tried selling condiments, and then shoes and fabrics, but without success. Because of this, she decided to learn from her aunt how to sell cereals. She now conducts her business with more than ten years experience and is highly sought after. She makes her sales from home and from a large market in Bougouni. \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, she decided to join Soro Yiriwaso, with whom she is on her sixth loan. All of her previous loans have been correctly repaid. With this loan, she will buy 1 ton of corn, 1 ton of pearl millet, and a half ton of rice. She procures her goods in Bougouni and in the surrounding villages. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to earn an average monthly income of 70,000 francs CFA, which will allow her to support her needs while also helping her husband with the family expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":509.09,"image":{"id":1339301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T09:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36713.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819652,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":36713.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678548,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":36713.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924178,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":36713.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207376,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":36713.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972030,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":36713.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624692,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":36713.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850729,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T12:44:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":551231,"name":"Hue","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hue, 38, is married and has two children.

He has been in this business now for 10 years. \r\n\r\nHaving learned about the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso from a friend, he decided to also join and take out a loan to buy 5 different key rings, some boxes of pliers, some hammers, some screwdrivers, some reels of cable and some switches from the wholesalers in Bamako. \r\n\r\nHe makes his sales in cash and often in credit to customers from all walks of life. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Soro Yiriwaso. The average monthly income of 80,000 francs CFA that he hopes to earn each month will allow him to expand his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1339314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy hardware products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T09:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T09:50:09Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yacouba ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":252408.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678549,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":252408.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972031,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T22:36:18Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":551233,"name":"Linh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linh is 38 years old, and is married.

He was born in a rural area, which is good for animal husbandry and farming. Tochikul comes from a poor family, and he helped his parents raise livestock and farm when he was a small boy. Coming from a poor family, he has gone through many difficult times. After graduating from high school, he got married, and his wife helped him raise livestock and grow crops. He mainly worked at raising livestock; that is, he would buy cattle at a low price, fatten them for a certain amount of time, and then resell them for a good price. This year their business has not been successful, which caused their oldest son to go abroad and work in Russia. Prior to this, Tochikul's family was completely dependent on the income from animal husbandry. In addition, Tochikul needs to repair his house and prepare for his son's wedding. Therefore, Tochikul has turned to IMON to obtain a loan to buy building materials. Tochikul is counting on your compassion and generosity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":603.82,"image":{"id":1337675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy building materials for repairing his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T13:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T13:10:01Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tochikul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":0.42,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":0.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510410,"comment":null},{"amount":0.06,"local_amount":0.26,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":0.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075245,"comment":null},{"amount":603.67,"local_amount":2840.8,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2872.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430227935,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T09:56:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":552981,"name":"Juan Obdulio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"juan de 39 a\u00f1os de edad, es muy amable y trabajador, vive con su esposa y su hijo de 15 a\u00f1os.

She wants to raise as much as she can because she is not worried about the feeds. The feeds are provided free of cost from the army mess and they are enough to feed a number of pigs.

She is a caring daughter-in-law. She takes care of her in-laws, kids and also raises pigs. She joined \"Sahei lom\" group with four other economically active women and she is the featured borrower member. She is pictured with the raised hand.\r\n\r\nHetin raise pigs but she was never in the position to buy more than three piglets. The insufficient capital always paralyses Hetin from raising pigs in good numbers. The pig sty that she has is also small and she needs more money to buy piglets and feed too. She raises pigs near the house because her in-laws are old and she can't leave them on their own. She purchase feed for the pigs in stocks from the market because she doesn't have time to collect food for the pigs in the nearby fields. She barely collects food for the pigs.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan she is planning to purchase two more piglets and renovate the present pig sty by extending the perimeter. Hetin says if her plan is successful, then she will open a bank account and make some savings so that she can build a house. At present her only savings are with the group and it is a small savings. She is elated to share that, with the assistance of the loan, she will now be able to construct a bigger pig sty and purchase two more piglets. She thanks WSDS and Kiva for reaching her and also requests to continue assisting the \"Sahei Lom\" group in the future.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is a primary milk producing area. She has four children and has been doing this work for 13 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan of 62,400 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nAgnes stated what is most enjoyable about farming is, 'Rearing livestock!' Her biggest challenge is, 'Low production due to low-yielding dairy animals.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Cheluk.'  Her highest monthly expense is farming costs. \r\n\r\nAgnes was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, and she said: 'Was first introduced to Juhudi by a friend.'  This client was also asked what she learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How I could boost production through acquisition of assets from an mfi.'  When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Agnes replied 'Will acquire a high yielding dairy animal.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Agnes owns the following: cow, poultry, motorcycle, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, a TV, or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

is a single Palestinian young man.

He is also a university student who wants to complete his studies, so he is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help him cover the cost of purchasing a new laptop.

This will ensure a better future for Ahed and improve his living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee.

Her deepest hope is that she can make double income from both her businesses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":471.09,"image":{"id":1337026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fishing outfits and more vegetables for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Tbaung Khmum district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":201000},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":189000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.34,"local_amount":201000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":208582.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364842261,"comment":null},{"amount":52.35,"local_amount":201000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":208582.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373047573,"comment":null},{"amount":52.34,"local_amount":201000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":208582.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381838683,"comment":null},{"amount":52.35,"local_amount":201000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":208582.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390696821,"comment":null},{"amount":52.34,"local_amount":201000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":208582.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399943018,"comment":null},{"amount":52.34,"local_amount":201000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":208582.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410226164,"comment":null},{"amount":52.35,"local_amount":201000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":208582.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420333071,"comment":null},{"amount":52.34,"local_amount":201000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":208582.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429642225,"comment":null},{"amount":52.34,"local_amount":201000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":208582.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440092361,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T21:55:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":551386,"name":"Olivia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olivia is 38 years old, married, and has four children.

Mar\u00eda fue madre soltera desde muy joven y por sus hijos ha trabajado duro para poder pagar una educaci\u00f3n digna de la cual ella no pudo gozar ya que por los escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos en su hogar, alcanz\u00f3 a terminar solo la escuela primaria. Esta mujer esforzada sue\u00f1a con ver a sus tres hijos convertidos en profesionales y adem\u00e1s poder ser due\u00f1a de un local amplio donde pueda atender su restaurante. Mar\u00eda vive actualmente en el cant\u00f3n de San Miguel de Los Bancos un pueblo que es muy visitado por las cascadas y biodiversidad de especies que se pueden observar en el paso por sus paisajes. Un lugar due\u00f1o de una exquisita gastronom\u00eda en comida t\u00edpica que es comercializada por varios de sus habitantes y que conjuntamente con hoteles, almacenes agropecuarios y oferta de deportes extremos aportan al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad.

","en":"Mar\u00eda, 48, is single and has three children: Andrea, 18, who is about to start university and Bryan and Diego who are 14 and 11 respectively and attend public school.  Mar\u00eda has been a single mother since a young age and has worked hard for her children to pay for a proper education for them, something she was unable to have because of her home\u2019s limited economic resources; she was only able to finish elementary school.\r\n\r\nThis self-sacrificing woman dreams with seeing her three children become professionals and also with being the owner of a spacious locale for her restaurant.  Mar\u00eda currently lives in San Miguel de Los Bancos Canton, a town that\u2019s very popular due to its waterfalls and its biodiversity that can be enjoyed in its different environments.  It\u2019s a place with delicious cuisine comprised of traditional dishes that various residents sell and together with hotels, agricultural warehouses and extreme sports contribute to the city\u2019s economic growth.  Also, in the rural zones there are homes dedicated to agriculture and animal husbandry where milk production and production of dairy products like cheese, cream, etc. stand out.\r\n\r\nFor the last two years Mar\u00eda has worked producing charcoal grilled food and is also a housewife tending to her children and giving them the time they require.
