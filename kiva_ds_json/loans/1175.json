On her last survey she indicated a poverty level of 3, which is to say she has good income but is conscious that this work and effort that she is making needs to be continuous and ongoing in order to be totally successful in order to be able to provide a better quality of life for her family. Between the work she does, she says that she makes chips to sell, which are a typical Paraguayan food that many people enjoy. We should also note the work of the counselors, who provide training and support while encouraging the women to fight in order to be able to overcome poverty. Miguela seeks a loan to buy ingredients to make chips, such as corn flower, starch, cheese, butter, and other items, which will help her solidify her business and thus increase her earnings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1396128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn flour, starch, cheese, butter, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Encarnaci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2013-07-26T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-25T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cerafina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Silvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wenceslaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Romina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Nelsi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":11655663,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1942611},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1942611},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1942611},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1942611},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1942611},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1942608}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":1942611,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1959674.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390570802,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":1942611,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1959674.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400810483,"comment":null},{"amount":875,"local_amount":3885222,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3919348.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410095883,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":1942611,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1959674.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419861448,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":1942608,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1959671.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733652,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-30T03:04:00Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:16:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586453,"name":"Zainab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 35-year-old Zainab, from Tombo, in the Western Rural area in Freetown.

She began her business because she was trained with business and she needed to generate income to support her younger sisters and brother.

She says that the main challenge to her business is a lack of capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nAbibatu requires a loan in order to buy soap powder and palm oil to expand her shop business.

Zulema has challenges in her business as the cold season is rather strong in the area where she lives and she has to go offer the merchandise and this is a slight disadvantage, but nonetheless she leaves during the early  morning hours and is going to use the funds to buy comforters, blankets, and articles that will provide warmth for the season in which we find ourselves."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":1396690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy bed comforters at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2013-07-26T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-25T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":4500,"lender_count":131,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Zulema Aidee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Kelly Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Helen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ricarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":4500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12400},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9300},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1350},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1800,"local_amount":12400,"processed_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12437.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419851355,"comment":null},{"amount":1350,"local_amount":9300,"processed_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":9328.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439725091,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T20:32:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":587826,"name":"Cristino Aparicio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cristino, se le presenta la necesidad de un nuevo  pr\u00e9stamo porque requiere de mas capitla de trabajo; este le permitir\u00e1 comprar los insumos agr\u00edcolas necesarios tales como: abono, herbicidas, pesticidas, plaguicidas, insecticidas, entre otros; esta inversi\u00f3n le ayudara a mejorar la producci\u00f3n y aumentara el cultivo, asimismo las ventas.\nLas circunstancias familiares y las condiciones economicas han mejorado.\n","en":"Cristino is in need of a new loan because he needs more capital for work.

Thanks to his parents' encouragement, Iwan is determined to learn in the program of Management and Harbour Administration in Commerce at AMN. The ideal for Iwan is to work in a large port in Indonesia. \r\n\r\nDue to economic conditions (his parents have no fixed income), Iwan volunteered to request a student loan from Kiva in order to ease the burden on his parents and continue his studies. Iwan is very grateful to the lenders from around the world who will help him with his studies, even though he is not able to get to know them personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1394501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay education fees for three years","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"CILACAP","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":253,"posted_date":"2013-07-26T05:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-25T05:20:01Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iwan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-26T12:04:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586630,"name":"Yeng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yeng is 50 years old and a villager from Kampong Cham province\u2019s Thbaung Khmum district.

a very hardworking man and a master in the agricultural trade. He is a native of the village Niyozbek, in the Kanibadam region. Ilyos rents land and is engaged in growing rice in his village. His wife works in a collective farm and helps him in the agricultural activities. Two of their sons are migrant works in the Russian Federation. \r\n\r\nIlyos is a forward-looking person and intends to develop his activities.

She is happily married and has two children, one of them school-age.\r\n\r\nShe is an active teacher, working for the Nicaragua Ministry of Education teaching primary school in the urban center of Condega. She teaches from 7:00 AM -12:00 PM Monday through Friday and in the afternoons she plans the classes for the following day. She has been working for the Ministry continuously for thirteen years. It is the primary source of income for her family to defray costs.\r\n\r\nMaricruz approaches Ceprodel to request a loan to be able to continue making improvements on her home. She has been remodeling it over time with previous loans awarded to her by Ceprodel.

He lives in Pantini and people there work in agriculture and raising cattle.

She decided to start this activity because she needed a source of income to support her family.  She succeeded in providing them with an education and this is her greatest source of pride.\r\n\r\nTherefore, seeing the good results and profits she gets, she wants to continue with her business.  This will be her first Kiva loan and she is grateful to all those who made her loan possible.  On the other hand she commits to make her payments punctually.  She will use the 1,000 new soles to buy the main raw material for making charcoal, waste lumber.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":239.91,"image":{"id":1396890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy charcoal-making raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-07-26T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-25T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":149.88,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":155.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865046,"comment":null},{"amount":59.82,"local_amount":159.53,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":165.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353412,"comment":null},{"amount":59.59,"local_amount":158.92,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":165.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905178,"comment":null},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":171.42,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-07T10:20:51Z","rounded_local_amount":178.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091171,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-27T13:59:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":587935,"name":"Viloroco Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cVILOROCO\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Copacabana, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Virginia es la Presidenta.

She is a homemaker. She is very humble. She had to learn how to work, as she doesn\u2019t have the benefit of an education. Thanks to her own efforts, she did learn how to read. She grew up in her parent\u2019s home. She has five siblings (three females and two males) who help support her parent\u2019s work in agriculture. Her parents also make machetes and long knives. At fifteen years old she was married in the church. She has five children (three girls who are 20, 12 and 7 years old and two boys who are 18 and 15 years old). Three of her children study at the school in her community. The school is a five-minute walk from their house. Her oldest daughter helps with the housework. Her son assists his father, who is a bricklayer. For the past twenty years Maria has sold spices (garlic, cinnamon, cumin, paprika among other types of spices). She also sometimes sells clothes in the neighboring villages. Also, two years ago, she began to butcher pigs. She sells the meat to households in the village. She buys her merchandise in the city, which is located in another department. He husband goes with her when she travels to the city. She has to hire a car to get to the city. She makes this trip two times a month. It takes an hour to get to the city where she buys her goods. She buys the pigs in her community and she butchers them at her mother\u2019s house. This house is located outside of her village. This location is good for sales. Every Saturday she butchers pigs. She goes to her mother\u2019s house on Friday so she can get up at three in the morning to butcher the pigs. Her son comes with her. Her son actually butchers the pigs and she sells the meat. The loan, that she is requesting, from the Countryside Foundation, will be used to buy clothes that she will sell during the August vacation season. She will invest $300.00 in clothes for all ages. The other $300.00 she will use to buy three pigs that will be butchered. The rest of the money will be used to buy spices on credit. She will then have a larger inventory of spices to sell. She will also be able to guarantee that she will have pork to sell on Saturdays. She will have three pigs, which will last her three weeks. This will give her family a larger income. She helps her husband to provide the necessary items for their children. With the earnings from her businesses she hopes to build a concrete house and also help her children with their education. Thanks to her efforts, she has already purchased two pieces of land, which is where she lives. \n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":301.16,"image":{"id":1395661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes to sell during the August vacations season.

is a conservative woman, so she let her husband take her place in the picture. Areen was born in 1988. She is married and lives with her husband in Madaba-Jordan. Areen has been working with her husband in selling mobile phones for two years. He started his project with selling accessories. Then it expanded to selling mobile phones at their own store, and they recently bought a photocopy machine as he was working close to the new court.

","en":"Bakhtiyor is a resilient and tolerant young man. He is 24 years old. He is married, but does not have children. His mother is a homemaker. Bakhtiyor is the sole breadwinner for the family. \r\n\r\nFor more than three years, he has been involved in raising livestock. He and his family live in a remote area and therefore it is very convenient and easy for him to develop a livestock business, rather than production or trade. He learned the subtleties of the business from his father, who also is involved in raising livestock. \r\n\r\nBakhtiyor buys livestock, fattens them up over a few months and then resells them at the local market. His business is not only a source of income, but also his labor or love. He wants to develop the business further and to get a bigger income. From the profits, he wants to improve living conditions before the birth of their first child. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of 1,500 somoni to purchase livestock. He promises to repay the loan on time.

is 42 years old and a widow. She lives with her children in a small village in Prey Chor district, Kompong Cham province. She is dedicated to the farming business to generate a livelihood. Aside from her hardships in farming, she also operates a retail store to earn more income to support her family.

He does not have any other source of income to fulfill the needs of the family, so he wants to expand his current business so that he can cope with all of the necessities but he does not have sufficient money to do so.\r\n\r\nAsma requested a loan of 50,000 PKR from Kiva field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband can buy a variety of cloths for ladies and gents to sell.\r\n\r\nAsma hopes that this loan will lead to positive changes for her husband's enterprise and for her family as well. Asma is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC

She does not receive any assistance from the father of her children and is therefore solely responsible to not only put food on the table, but also to pay for her children\u2019s education and personal needs.  To support her family, Gloria Eugenia sells mid-day meals to construction workers and tortillas at lunch-time.  When a construction job is ending, the workers tell her where they are going to be next and that is how she has been able to keep a constant clientele.\n\nGloria knows that she lacks the financial capital to be able to offer sodas with her mid-day meals.  She intends to use her loan to purchase sodas and corn by bulk so she can reduce her costs and increase her profit.\n\nHer actual profit is Q2,035 (US$265) working 224 hours a month (US$1.18\/hour).  She has set a modest goal with her business advisor to improve her profit by 10%  \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1003.41,"image":{"id":1398776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase sodas and corn by bulk to reduce costs and increase profit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Catalina Bobadilla, Antigua Guatemala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-07-27T00:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-26T00:00:09Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladiz Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Lizeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emeteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":14400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":208.2,"local_amount":1620.58,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1628.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399818737,"comment":null},{"amount":206,"local_amount":1603.46,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1611.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410095146,"comment":null},{"amount":178.11,"local_amount":1386.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1393.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419860865,"comment":null},{"amount":214.02,"local_amount":1665.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1673.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509402,"comment":null},{"amount":197.08,"local_amount":1533.99,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1541.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733254,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-16T22:15:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586970,"name":"Naama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naama is a 21 year old single woman with no children.

She is a native of one of the neighbourhoods of the municipality of Chinandega located in the west of the country. Alcira is a hardworking, honorable, responsible woman with a great desire to get ahead in life. In her spare time she greatly enjoys relaxing in the evening with a milky coffee and cookies and listening to her favorite music.\r\n\r\nAlcira started work as a young child so she could help support her family. Then later she became a single mother and again went out to work to pay for household expenses, selling candy in the markets and bus stops. She managed to save a bit of money and used it to open a small candy stall in her house.

joven aprendiendo distintas labores desde los quehaceres del hogar hasta la fabricaci\u00f3n de bloques de cemento. Mar\u00eda es soltera y a sus 23 a\u00f1os tuvo un hijo que ahora ya tiene su propia familia con quienes Mar\u00eda vive en Latacunga capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador y que los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. Aunque hay un alto \u00edndice de pobreza el esp\u00edritu emprendedor de sus habitantes ha hecho que la  ciudad sobresalga. En el sector rural y urbano se puede encontrar familias destacando sus talentos para emprender con alguna idea que les pueda generar rentabilidad para conseguir el sustento diario. \nMar\u00eda aprendi\u00f3 a elaborar bloques de cemento para la construcci\u00f3n de casas gracias a la instrucci\u00f3n de su hermana con quien trabaj\u00f3 mucho tiempo en esta labor, hace 2 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 emprender el negocio por s\u00ed misma, poniendo en pr\u00e1ctica la experiencia que gan\u00f3 con su hermana. Mar\u00eda invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en la preparaci\u00f3n del material, elaboraci\u00f3n y arrumando los bloques, labor cuyos procesos tienen un nivel de dificultad alto y hasta riesgoso, sin embargo Mar\u00eda ha continuado con la esperanza de un d\u00eda cumplir su sue\u00f1o de tener su casa propia para as\u00ed tener una vejez tranquila y confortable. Mar\u00eda solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en material e insumos para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus bloques, pues en ocasiones la falta de alg\u00fan insumo o material detiene la producci\u00f3n y por lo general los pedidos son siempre al por mayor, por lo que Mar\u00eda no puede permitirse una falta de producto, sin embargo en ocasiones ha perdido ventas ya que no pod\u00eda abastecerse de materia prima por la falta de capital, sin embargo alguien le recomend\u00f3 ir a solicitar el cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde gracias al producto Kiva, le pueden prestar la ayuda econ\u00f3mica que necesita para seguir produciendo y crecer en su negocio y de esta forma sumar sus ganancias con lo cual puede aportar al mejoramiento de calidad de vida de su hijo, nuera y nietos con quienes vive. ","en":"Mar\u00eda is 57 years old. She studied and passed primary school, and has worked since she was very young, learning different jobs ranging from household chores to making cement blocks. She is single, and when she was 23 years old, she had a son, who now has his own family, with whom Mar\u00eda lives in Latacunga, which is the capital of the province of Cotopaxi.\r\n\r\nCotopaxi is one of the provinces that make up the mountainous region of Ecuador. In recent years it has experienced a significant amount of development, such that it is now considered one of the most important of the region, thanks to its flower-growing, mining, metallurgy, agribusiness, agriculture and livestock industries. Latacunga, moreover, has many businesses that generate significant revenues and which make it a city of commerce with various opportunities to get ahead. Although there is a high poverty index, the entrepreneurial spirit of its inhabitants has made the city excel. There are families in both the rural and urban sectors that stand out for their talent for pursuing an idea that can generate profit for them and permit them to meet their daily needs.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda learned to make cement blocks for building houses from her sister, with whom she worked for a long time. Two years ago she decided to start her own business, putting into practice the experience she gained while working with her sister. Mar\u00eda invests at least eight hours every day preparing the raw material, making the bricks and then piling them up. All of these tasks have a high level of difficulty and are even risky. Nevertheless, Mar\u00eda has continued with her work with the hope that one day she will achieve her dream, which is to have her own home so that she can live out her later years in peace and comfort.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is requesting a loan to buy materials and supplies for making cement blocks. She says that sometimes she does not have some of the necessary materials or supplies for making cement blocks and that this stops her production. She also says that in general the orders are always in bulk, so that she cannot permit herself to run out of product. Unfortunately, on occasions she has lost sales because she has not had some primary materials in stock because of a lack of capital. Someone recommended that she request a loan from the field partner, where, she says thanks to Kiva, they can give her the economic help that she needs to continue production, grow her business and increase her profits. With these profits, she hopes to improve the quality of life of her son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren with whom she lives."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":494.23,"image":{"id":1396888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy materials and supplies for making cement blocks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-27T03:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-26T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Ubaldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1668.53,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":87.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":97.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":99.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":102.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":104.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":108.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":111.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":115.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":118.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":120.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":123.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":126.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":128.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.03},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.99,"local_amount":87.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":87.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814472,"comment":null},{"amount":198.17,"local_amount":197.4,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":198.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320643,"comment":null},{"amount":104.43,"local_amount":104.03,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:57Z","rounded_local_amount":104.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856331,"comment":null},{"amount":103.64,"local_amount":103.24,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":103.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059909,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-14T01:26:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":589485,"name":"Inacio","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"In\u00e1cio \u00e9 casado, tem 5 filhos, dos quais 2 estudam frequentando o n\u00edvel prim\u00e1rio.

The youngest child hasn't reached school age yet. She lives with her children in a house that she owns. She works an 8-hour day as a service agent in a public hospital. The house where she lives isn't finished yet, that is to say, she's been building it little by little due to scarce financial resources. That's why the money from the recent loan will be used to purchase sand, cement and window frames so she can continue building her house. In the future she intends to build rooms for renting out so that she can obtain more money to support her children. In the future she'll work harder and get more loans from Hluvuku in order to accomplish her
