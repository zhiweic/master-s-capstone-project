Her house is located in the city of Imperial.  This is a city that is known for its mild and pleasant weather and also for its agriculture.  Betty is a tenacious woman, who most of all has always given 100% to provide for her children.  This has been a great accomplishment of hers, and  to do it she has always been very optimistic.  She put in a lot of effort to start up her business selling handicrafts.  Gradually, she started to get ahead, and later she added a business selling cakes and corn pudding.  Then, after saving up some money, she bought a food cart and started selling salchipollos (a dish with fried chicken and fried potatoes) and hamburgers.  At first, Betty was afraid to go out into the streets to sell her products, because she was a little shy.  But she gradually got used to it and lost this fear.  After that, when she started selling her hamburgers in the market in her city, it was a bit difficult for her because as she was selling outside, they would not allow her to be there.  But she eventually managed to rent a small spot in the market and kept improving her business.  She believes that her business is succeeding because she is very hardworking and because she treats her customers in a very friendly way.\r\n\r\nBetty is very grateful for the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help that they have provided her with, she will be able to buy handicrafts to sell for Mother's Day.  She will also purchase a rice cooker to cook her chicken and hamburgers.  This way she will improve her income and will be able to continue working toward realizing her biggest dream: to have her own restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1089355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

His father taught him everything to do with the business, and once he turned 18 years old, Rogelio went out on his own to work his own lands.  Even though he has employees that help him carry out the daily activities, Rogelio himself works his plots of land.  Rogelio also works for the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d (Huatusco Regional Union) as a coffee taster.  He invests a lot of time in his coffee tasting, as he has to select the finest quality coffee for export.  During the last harvest, Rogelio had a total production of 9 tons of coffee.  He plans, in the course of 3 years, to have his farm producing a total of 12 tons of coffee.  He has the necessary expanse of land to make it possible.  Rogelio needs a loan to purchase fertilizers, which will allow him to meet the goal he has set for himself.  Leaving the coffee crop to one side, another of Rogelio's current needs is to repair the access to his house.  It's in bad conditions and is damaging his car.

For the work needed in  his coffee plantation, Gonzalo hires laborers to help him, in this way contributing to the finances of these people and their families.\r\n\r\nIn his coffee farm, he has planted some fruit trees that are good for giving shade to the coffee plants. For the next harvest, he needs to plant new seedlings, as he has a half hectare on his farm that is unplanted. He also needs to do clearing and soil conservation work, and that is why he needs a loan. \r\n\r\nNow Gonzalo's children have completed their university degrees, so his goal is to set up, within a short time, a sales outlet, with his sons, his wife, and a nephew.

This group is comprised of ten women with small businesses who sell different products. Amanda is a single mother with three children. They live in the city of Santo Domingo. She has always worked hard to give her children what she was not able to have in her childhood. \r\n\r\nAmanda\u2019s business is a butcher shop. She sells different types of meat like chicken, pork, and beef. She has been working in this business for about five years. This is her 8th loan with Esperanza Internancional.

Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nShe is a very good wife, who tries to help her husband with the heavy responsibility of the household.  In order to do so she gets loans that he uses in his business.  He sells shoes, clothes, and other items.  She tells us that he travels to other places in his car to sell his products.  While he does this she does housework in a house in the area.  However, in her free time she also sells Avon products (beauty items, cosmetics, perfume, and women\u2019s accessories).\r\n\r\nThis is how they join together to be able to do what is needed to get their family ahead.  She has had this business for 20 years, and it is going quite well for her.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy shoes, clothes, perfume, jewelry, cosmetics, creams, and other products.

She lives with two of them in her own home, which is located in the town of Bellavistsa - Tarma.  \r\n<p>\r\nKnowing that she must help her children get ahead, Vilma works alone in the fields since farming is her main business activity.  She has been performing this tiring work for more than 20 years, but she does this for her children, who are her reason for pressing forward.  Vilma grows peas, beans, corn, and potatoes.  She provides her crops with constant care.  Her routine begins at dawn because the crops are located 30 minutes from her house and she must walk a great distance to get to them.  She also owns animals, such as cows and bulls, and allows them to graze while she attends to her crops.  \"I enjoy what I do.  With the milk from the cows, I am able to make cheeses that I can sell to my neighbors and friends,\" she mentions.  Vilma is going through a critical time since she lacks capital.  For this reason, she had to close down her grocery business.  Over time and with her savings, she was able to acquire her own farmland where she could grow her crops without worry.  \r\n<p>\r\nVilma is a member of the Communal Bank \"Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay\" and this will be her second loan with MFP.  She expects the financial support will help her continue to meet her goals.  Vilma feels comfortable working with her group because their work results in team-building and responsibility.  She will invest the money in three sacks of pea seeds.  The rest will be used to pay for the services of workers who will be hired to do the planting.

For this reason, he decided to have his own business, so he opened a poultry shop in 2008. He\u2019s a respectable person known for his good place and delicious food.

The work Herminio does is quite dangerous because he works until the wee hours of the night which is why he\u2019s asking for a loan to buy tires for his vehicle because it\u2019s the only source of income he has to support his family.\r\n\r\nHerminio\u2019s dream is to build more rooms and improve the ones he has because he\u2019d like to have more comfort and to improve his quality of life.

","en":"Dewis, 34, lives in the city of Cartagena.  He has a small cobbler shop run for all the members of his family, a business that he started so he could develop his free and entrepreneurial work spirit.  He arrived in Cartagena five years ago from Santa Ana Magdalena with a great desire to work.\r\n\r\nHe started his work life as an employee in a neighborhood store.  When he got together his money little by little to be independent and he had learned how to deal with customers, he decided to apply his knowledge of shoe repair to a business that would generate his own means of support.  He does this with great happiness, just as the photo shows.\r\n\r\nHe is located in an informal stall, a strategic place where he is well recognized by the residents of the area.  Not only does Dewis repair shoes for women, men, and children, very early in the day he also sells coffee and tobacco products on the terrace of a store.  For this he has 18 thermoses that he acquired little by little, the result of his work as a cobbler.\r\n\r\nHis long-term goal is to improve the conditions of his cobbler business and to grow with machinery and equipment.  He also will adapt his infrastructure so that when he organizes his family everything is ready to give them well-being and to be even happier.\r\n\r\nCurrently he is applying for a Kiva loan, the first loan he has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it he will buy work materials such as adhesive, molds, soles, etc.  He also will buy more thermoses and will make the most of this investment to have a new and elegant cart with which he will impress his market.\r\n\r\nHis Kiva loan will be successful because today it is a big challenge to get enough alternative working capital to invest.  With his Kiva loan he will respond to his rising growth, improve his service, better present the quality and security of his image, and cultivate new customers, converting them into devoted buyers of his products and services.  These are his main goals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1090111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy adhesive, molds, soles, etc., as well as thermoses and a new cart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-16T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-15T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dewis Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76270},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80383},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82259},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84178},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86142},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90768}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.76,"local_amount":76270,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":80769.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101166,"comment":null},{"amount":48.23,"local_amount":80383,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":85125.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338779,"comment":null},{"amount":49.36,"local_amount":82259,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":87112.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395332,"comment":null},{"amount":50.5,"local_amount":84178,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":89144.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775136,"comment":null},{"amount":104.97,"local_amount":174958,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":185280.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387122,"comment":null},{"amount":1.18,"local_amount":1952,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2067.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993972,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-17T03:43:46Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":423951,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"John tiene 35 a\u00f1os, es padre de una hermosa ni\u00f1a de nombre Katerin, de 11 a\u00f1os.

She is 36 years old, mother of two children, ages 18 and 8.  She loves her children very much and has always worked very hard to get them ahead.  She has been raising the children alone because their father left her and since then, she has become both father and mother to them.  Her home is located in Ica, a city known for having a warm and welcoming climate at any time of year. Ica is also the home of the Huacachina Lagoon which sits amidst spectacular sand dunes and receives many tourists throughout the year.  When she has free time, she enjoys listening to music and eating one of her favorite dishes, the delicious \u201cCarapulcra\u201d (a spicy Peruvian stew with freeze-dried potatoes).  She only completed a high school education but would have liked to study computer science and information technology.  \r\n\r\nDay by day, Mercedes goes out to work in her business, selling natural products.  She dedicates about nine hours a day to her business and may serve up to twenty customers per day.  She believes that her business is going well because she is very friendly toward her customers and most importantly, she offers quality products.\r\n\r\nMercedes is very grateful for the Kiva loans because thanks to the help they have provided, she will be able to purchase more merchandise for her business and buy a stove.

The money he saves will be invested in his son.  \r\n<p>\r\nJhonnatan dreams of having a house of his own so that he can provide more security and comfort for his son.  He also wants to improve his income and his quality of life.  This is the first time he has worked with IMPRO and Kiva.

is a prospective student applying for a loan to start his undergraduate work on a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology at Strathmore University. This is his story:\r\n\r\nI am Victor, age 19, and I am an orphan from Laikipia, a rural and semi-arid district in Kenya. I succeeded in my final secondary school exams and was admitted to Strathmore University in Nairobi, Kenya, for a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology. However, due to financial challenges in my family, I\u2019m unable to start university.\r\n \r\nUntil April this year, I have been teaching at a local primary school earning $38 US per month. Currently I am undertaking private studies to be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with the hope that this will complement my university education. After paying for my basic needs and the CPA exams, the money I earned from teaching was not enough to allow me make any savings for my university education. My elder sister is in college pursuing a Business Administration course, and it has been difficult for our aging grandmother to pay her fees due to her dwindling income from farming.\r\n \r\nMy desire has been to pursue a degree course specifically at Strathmore University because of its reputation for offering high quality and competitive courses. Strathmore\u2019s top graduates are assured of getting jobs with well paying organizations within three months after graduation. At Strathmore University, I will work as hard as I did in high school to excel in my studies and in extracurricular activities. \r\n\r\nI selected my program because it prepares well for current and future career demands in areas of business and information technology. This will give me good prospects for either getting a job or being self employed offering consultancy services in diverse sectors of the economy. My goal for the future is not only to grow in my career, but to contribute to society by motivating and offering help to other needy students like me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":15000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":952.94,"image":{"id":1092620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher
