Like a good Peruvian, she likes the traditional dishes of our country very much.  One of her favorite dishes is the delicious \"Seco de Res\" [beef stew].\r\n\r\nHer home is located in the city of Nazca, known for its warm climate.  This city also was the site of one of the most important pre-Inca cultures in our country, the magnificent Nazca culture.  They left as their legacy one of the most important tourist attractions in the country, the Nazca Lines, immense drawings in a vast desert.  According to some studies, they served as an astronomical calendar for the Nazca culture. \r\n\r\nMelida goes out every day to work with a lot of enthusiasm in her business selling groceries.  She works at her business around 13 hours a day and serves up to 25 customers in a day.  She believes that it is going well for her in her business because she is very friendly with the customers and very dedicated to her job.\r\n\r\nMelida is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they have given her she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business (rice, sugar, noodles, and canned goods, among other things).  In this way she will have a greater variety of products to sell to her customers, which will allow her to have greater income and get ahead to make her biggest dream a reality: \"To have her own house.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1059539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

Things have gone very well for him in this business, as he learned the work quickly, and earned the appreciation of his customers.\r\n\r\nHowever, approximately two years ago he had to overcome one of the greatest adversities that has arisen in his life. His mattress factory burned down, leaving the entire shop burned, and no good material inside the shop could be recovered. In addition a 5-year-old daughter died in this tragedy. However, Fabio's fortitude allowed him to move forward and restart his mattress factory, which he still has at the present time, and where he continues offering very good products to his customers. \r\n\r\nThanks to his good sales, Fabio is seeking a loan that will offer him the chance to purchase raw materials for making the mattresses, and buying beds and tables to offer to his customers.\r\n\r\nFabio hopes to continue responding to customer orders and keep progressing in his business together with his wife and six children. In addition, Fabio's dream is to have his own shop, and not have to continue paying the high rental costs that reduce his earnings considerably. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1058053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy raw materials for making mattresses, and to buy beds and tables to offer his customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-04-10T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-10T18:00:08Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabio De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44602},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45857},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47147},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48473},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49836},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51238},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52679},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54161},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55685},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57251},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58861},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60517},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62219},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63970},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65769},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67619},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69521},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71477},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73487},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75554},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77680},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79865},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":82111},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84421}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":411187,"name":"Gustavo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gustavo is 53 years old and divorced, and lives in the Cayambe region of Ecuador.

The rest of the members continue with the activities they\u2019ve been carrying out.\r\n\r\nCatalina is 55 years old and a widow; she has seven children, six adult boys who are all employed and a 17 year old girl who is studying at the CBTA [Farming and Animal Husbandry Technical High School].  She sells crafts like ponchos, shawls, knitted capes, paper goods and fruit like peaches, pears, plums and flowers and sheep.  \r\n\r\nShe asked for her loan to buy wool yarn, construction paper, notebooks, pencils, mechanical pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, modeling clay, colored pencils and crepe paper.  She started her business 22 years ago needing to find a way to get ahead with her children.  \r\n\r\nShe learned how to make shawls and ponchos from her mother.  Her business is important because she obtains income that helps with her daughter\u2019s school costs and because it keeps her occupied.  \r\n\r\nShe likes everything she does; in the afternoons she tends to her stationery shop.  One day a week she sells flowers and two days a week she makes the shawls.  She likes to make the shawls and ponchos and see them finished.  She feels proud to have won a contest with one of the shawls she made.  This is a popular business because of the indigenous crafts.\r\n\r\nHer dreams and hopes are to make her stationery shop grow and to have services like photocopying and spiral binding and to see that her children become responsible people and that they don\u2019t lack anything.  She is happy with the loan she\u2019s going to receive because she is going to expand the stationery shop.\r\n\r\nThe group members want to say to Kiva and to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad:  \u201cWe thank you for your loans; you help us keep our businesses well-stocked and to live better with our families.\u201d \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":1057368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy wool yarn, construction paper, notebooks, pencils, mechanical pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners. modeling clay, colored pencils, crepe paper.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-10T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-10T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Libia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domitila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Enriqueta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":41000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":3091.46,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":39285.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656799,"comment":null},{"amount":158.54,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2014.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301400055,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T21:57:27Z","paid_date":"2012-10-02T08:40:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410359,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

It is a community with a lot of vegetation and the people are hardworking and friendly. They decided on the name of their group because at the place where they meet to make their payments there is a \u201ct\u201d of four roads and they relate this with life because they say in life there are various roads, and each one chooses the one they like, and if things go poorly don\u2019t stay bogged-down, go a better way. They are all very optimistic and they have a good view of life. This group is made up of seven hardworking women, eager to get ahead, and their names and activities are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.  Mar\u00eda Guadalupe G. (to buy merchandise for her grocery store and clothes to sell)\r\n2.  Cecilia C. (to buy chickens, feed, corn, fabric and embroidery thread to sell)\r\n3.  Ver\u00f3nica L.

She is a hardworking woman and she is asking for a loan in order to buy chickens, feed, corn, fabric and thread for embroidering and selling; she already works selling chickens and she embroiders napkins. She has 6 years experience in this work, years in which she has seen benefit for her work. She buys her chickens from chicken farmers passing by, when they are still little, and then she raises them in her home and when they are grown she sells them. She buys her fabric and thread in her municipality, and she takes it home and in her free time she works embroidering napkins with very pretty results, and later when she has finished she offers them to acquaintances. Cecilia used to be immobilized due to a lack of money, but when she stepped up for funding she found a surge to her economy. \u201cThe thing is to not give up and to use your time on something productive, and to know how to invest your money wisely,\u201d says Cecilia."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1031204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy chickens, feed, corn, fabric and embroidery thread in order to sell items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Nicolas Guadalupe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6739.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7095.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7400.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7765.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":586.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":534.48,"local_amount":6739.09,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6792.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656802,"comment":null},{"amount":562.73,"local_amount":7095.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":7151.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317473,"comment":null},{"amount":586.9,"local_amount":7400.02,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7458.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418857,"comment":null},{"amount":615.89,"local_amount":7765.54,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7826.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568437,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T08:20:47Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410363,"name":"Delfines Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Abraham tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad el estudio una carrera t\u00e9cnica y dice que ya no continuo con sus estudios por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos, el es parte del grupo Delfines y dice que le pusieron ese nombre porque se sienten libres de trabajar con la financiera aparte de que son unos animales muy inteligentes.

Ella tiene una huerta de aguacate desde hace mas de 15 a\u00f1os y dice que entre su esposo y ella han sacado adelante este huerto para as\u00ed tener una mejor calidad de vida. Platica que cuando es temporada de cosecha sale a vender a la central de abastos desde muy temprana hora y a veces los vende en el mercado de una poblaci\u00f3n cercana a de ella, los vende por bolsitas. Ahorita ella est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de abonos org\u00e1nicos, fertilizantes, calidra e insecticidas y que con los fuertes aires que han azotado a su comunidad se le ha pegado una plaga de ara\u00f1itas que desgraciadamente no dejan que crezcan en buen estado los frutos y es por eso que le urge el cr\u00e9dito para eliminar ese tipo de plagas. Dice que gracias al cr\u00e9dito mantendr\u00e1 en muy buen estado su huerta y con las ganancias que obtenga dice que ahorrara para en el mes de octubre y noviembre comprar flor de noche buena y revenderla en el Estado  de M\u00e9xico.

She says that thanks to the loan she\u2019ll be able to keep her orchard in good condition and with profits obtained she says she\u2019ll save up so that in October and November she will buy poinsettias to resell in the state of M\u00e9xico.\r\n\r\nThe other three group members are called Mar\u00eda Ver\u00f3nica, Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica and Graciela.

She has two businesses there.  On the one hand she sells various merchandise via specialized catalogues; she sells perfumes and cosmetics that way.  On the other hand, she also makes fast food in her own neighborhood and adjacent areas.  She started her business 7 years ago to strengthen her home\u2019s wellbeing which up to that time was entirely her spouse\u2019s responsibility. The merchandise in her catalogues she sells directly herself while the fast food is prepared with help from her children Thursdays and Sundays.  \r\n\r\nShe is applying for Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy perfume, creams, costume jewelry that are on special discount in her catalogues and for which she has many pending orders; she will also buy in larger amounts the ingredients she needs to make her fast food like cured meats, baked goods, sauces, etc.  Her greatest challenge is insufficient working capital to attain the growth she aspires to and this is precisely the reason why her Kiva loan will be successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1059655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

children.  In search of an income for her family, in 2000, Zamira began her business in animal husbandry with 25,000 som (KGS).  Zamira does her work reverently and very seriously.  Thanks to this approach, today Zamira's farm has seven goats and their offspring, four cows, two calves, one horse, and six ponies.  Regardless of the vast amount of labor intensive work, which takes a lot of time, Zamira also farms.  She works 0.5 ha of land where she grows clover, corn, and potatoes.   Her monthly income from the farm comes to about 7,000 som (KGS), a part of which she sets aside for paying her daughter's university tuition.  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Zamira applied to Bai Tushym & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) for purchasing mares so she can sell kumis (mare's milk).  Zamira is planning to invest the income in further increasing the number of her livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":1065430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T11:00:04Z","loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1287.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1287.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1287.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":60361.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095511,"comment":null},{"amount":1287.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":60361.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754619,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-12T07:36:51Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:22:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410407,"name":"Gabriel Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gabriel de 50 a\u00f1os vive (Quevedo Ecuador ).el  trabajaba anteriormente en otra cosa pero como le fue mal y se quedo sin trabajo empez\u00f3 a vender cangil y papitas y le resulto le va bien .  y desde ese entonces se dedica a la venta de papas y canguil.

She\u2019s 38 years old and is a single mother of a 15 year old son, Diego, who attends secondary school in Acatl\u00e1n.  \r\n\r\nEva tells us that she started out working outside the home as an employee but one day decided to sell underwear via catalogue and noted that she earned more this way and had more time to spend with her son and educate him.  She\u2019s been selling underwear for more than two years now and she comments that she sells house to house.  \r\n\r\nShe takes the catalogues to her customers, takes their orders, places them with her suppliers and the when the orders are delivered to her she delivers them and collects payment.  She sells in her community and also goes out to other towns like Cosolapa, Texonapa, Refugio and Motzorongo.  She tells us that she decided to start to work because she\u2019s a single mother and she had to clothe, shoe and feed her son.  Eva also has a small corral in her back yard where she has some sheep she raises to then sell.  She needs the loan to buy catalogues, underwear and feed for her sheep.\r\n\r\nEva hopes that with this loan her business will prosper and she will be able to use her profits to sell sheets and bedspreads.  She wants to keep working because she wants her son to have a profession in the future.  Eva is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for the opportunity it\u2019s giving her with this loan so that her business can make progress and for the trust placed in her by granting the loan.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nVeronica-nutrition club\r\nAna-cosmetics sales\r\nMar\u00eda-nutrition club\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1059815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy catalogues, underwear and feed for her sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Aserradero, Acatlan de Perez Figueroa, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2654.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2805.02},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2915.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3069.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3201.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3354.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.43},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":210.15,"local_amount":2654.55,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2682.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656821,"comment":null},{"amount":452.87,"local_amount":5720.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5781.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418875,"comment":null},{"amount":243,"local_amount":3069.49,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3102.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568453,"comment":null},{"amount":253.43,"local_amount":3201.3,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-19T08:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3235.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399786,"comment":null},{"amount":265.55,"local_amount":3354.26,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407529,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-19T20:59:31Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":411757,"name":"Lham-Erdene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lham-Erdene is a 34-year-old woman who lives with her husband and two children in Bayanhongor province in Southern Mongolia.

","en":"Asmar is 38 years old.  Her childhood was spent in the Sadovoe village.  After finishing ninth grade of the secondary school and according to an ancient tradition (which outlived itself today), she was stolen for marriage.  Having become a homemaker, Asmar gave birth to three children and, in search of a source of income for her family, started a business in animal husbandry.  Having started with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS), Asmar was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of 11,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and milk products.  Today her business contains two dairy cows and one horse.  In order to further develop her business, Asmar requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional heads of livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into educating her son, who attends a technical college, and into expanding her business in the future.

Every third day she buys sixty kilos of assorted fish.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she goes to sell with her husband Baltasar in neighboring towns. Baltasar leaves her in a town called Jicayan while he goes to sell in San Juan and Santiago. When he finishes, he passes through Jicayan and the two of them return to their house. Juliana has five children: Baltasar is twenty-two years old, Antonio is twenty, Victor is fifteen, Elena Edith is seventeen, and Oscar is fourteen. They also accompany their mother to sell when they have days off.\r\n\r\nJuliana tells us that she sells all her fish in a single day, so her clients place orders. Since they recommend her, she occasionally gives them a fish so that they have enough left over for broth.\r\n\r\nJuliana requested the loan in order to buy more fish to sell, including clams, crabs, sea bass, snapper, and carp. She tells us that she is content with her business and with all the blessings God has given her so that she can succeed in her business.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the foundation for wanting to

Her family lives in their own ger, a traditional Mongolian felt tent, which is located in the outer ger district (a district without basic infrastructure) of Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia.\r\n\r\nTsatsral has been supporting her family by operating a clothing retail stall at Mongolia's largest outdoor market for six years, with the help of her spouse. She usually sells women's clothes, which she imports from Ereen, a border city between Mongolia and China. As she is a friendly person, she already has her own constant customers. Tsatsral wants to expand her business in order to increase her working capital. \r\n\r\nSo she is requesting a 1,800,000 MNT (Mongolian Tugriks) loan to purchase clothes from Ereen city to sell during this high shopping season. Her long-term goal is to improve her living conditions by renovating her current small ger.\r\n\r\nShe is a group leader and she has her hand up in the picture.

Over the years she has proven herself to be a strong woman, a fighter who raised 8 children alone after suffering the loss of her beloved husband.  She used to sell groceries and drinks, but unfortunately her son became gravely ill.  She was alone with her small children and had to dedicate herself to her son.  She bought all of the medicine that her son needed and paid for the doctor's visits.  Bit by bit her business fell apart, because she didn't have time to work there and the little money that she made she used for her young son.  \r\n\r\nAfter this large challenge, and her son's recovery, she decided to start over. Her shop no longer had anything to sell, and she didn't have much money to purchase more products, so she decided to sell chanfainita (a Peruvian dish) on the weekends.  She has to get up very early to shop for what she needs and of course has to give her best so that her dishes are delicious.  Georgia also sells seasonal fruit, so she is currently selling mangoes and pacay fruit, which brings in a little extra money. \r\n\r\nGregoria has requested our support to help her achieve her dream of reopening her grocery store.  For this reason she need to purchase rice, sugar, paper towels, napkins, coffee, milk, etc. so that she can have the great shop she had before. This will make her very content and she will be able to improve her quality of life so that her children are proud of her and continue to be independent and supportive, as always.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1060478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to reopen her grocery store and purchase rice, sugar, napkins, coffee, milk, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"SANTIAGO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.160833 -72.257222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":75.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":81.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":84.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":87.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.36,"local_amount":75.89,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":80.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276602121,"comment":null},{"amount":31.66,"local_amount":79.17,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283091243,"comment":null},{"amount":32.62,"local_amount":81.56,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":87.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298374,"comment":null},{"amount":69.01,"local_amount":172.51,"processed_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":184.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351127,"comment":null},{"amount":36.35,"local_amount":90.87,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":96.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345690,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T22:40:59Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:15:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":411802,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Delia is fifty-two years old and married with six children.\r\n\r\nDelia works hard to provide for her family.

She became involved in animal husbandry 20 years ago, having started this business with an initial sum of 20,000 som (KGS). At the present time, Anarkul's business yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and milk products.
