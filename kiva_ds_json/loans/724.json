loans purposely for business expansion and making good profits.  Hochi is 53 years old, and she is a mother of four adult children.  Her husband works at a pressure station and earns a minimum income of only 270 somoni or 55 dollars per month, and this is why the business brings in an additional income for the family.  The family has an average living minimum.  Hochi's youngest daughter, Nigora, helps her with the business.  Hochi's place of business is located among the rows of women's purses sales at the central Panshanbe market.

At the beginning of her entrepreneurial activity, she sold women's undergarments and had a small business turnover.  The selection of goods was also limited.  Salomat's husband works as a cook at a cafeteria, and his entire income gets used for family expenses.  Also, one of the client's sons works in Russia and sends them money for living expenses every month.  Salomat has been increasing her good turnover year after year with the help of the loans and used the resulting profits to marry off her daughter and repair her house.  Over the nine years of credit history, Salomat has not once violated the terms of the organization.  Over this time, she changed her place of business and today leases a container at the large clothing market, \"Somon,\" and her goods turnover increased several fold.  And also their social and family condition increased and improved.  Salomat plans use her new loan to purchase seasonal merchandise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":922756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is married to Eddie, who is also her business partner.  With her husband, Alicia manages the household and operates their business.  She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlicia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, workers and most families only eat home-cooked meals in the evening because it is the time when all of the family members are home. This is not only a family tradition, but also a matter of convenience and frugality. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when it costs less to buy cooked rice and meat.  In addition to her food stall business, Alicia sells homemade snacks and pork meat for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

He sells at the market in Baguineda, for cash and rarely on credit to a customer base made up of women and men. \r\n\r\nSidi Yaya hopes to make an average monthly profit of 75,000FCFA which will be used to repay his loan, to provide for his family's expenses and to reinvest in his business.\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":928496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kounkodjan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T10:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sidi Yaya ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":64351.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874374,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":64351.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424704,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-28T08:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":64351.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756947,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:52Z","rounded_local_amount":64351.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410762,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-04T17:12:23Z","paid_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362754,"name":"Wekhonya Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith takes care of eight children at home.

three children. Nineteen years ago in search of a source of income for his family Manasbek started his business selling food and basic goods using the sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Manasbek's store is known for good quality products which are sold at a low price, which is important for people with low incomes. Through persistence and hard work Manasbek was able to develop his business with a monthly income of about 20,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop his business Manasbek turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to expand the product range.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCatherine operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCatherine hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":928515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-25T20:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5333,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5522.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529568,"comment":null},{"amount":126.66,"local_amount":5334,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5523.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738810,"comment":null},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":6666,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6902.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146042,"comment":null},{"amount":63.33,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2761.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275154,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-26T00:46:01Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362773,"name":"Gawa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gawa is 26-year-old a married woman with three children between the age of 6 year to 2 years.

She is married to Rhoderic, a driver. She is the mother of three children. Together with her husband and children, she manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMaria Teresa maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers depend on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 4,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 13,000-PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMaria Teresa fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day and hopes to grow her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship* co-members to share stories of her work every week, where she can draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":928550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for merchandise needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-25T20:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":866.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3467,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3488.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529569,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3466,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3487.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738812,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3467.04,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3488.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146044,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2599.96,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275158,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-27T10:57:29Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362790,"name":"Ganbold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ganbold, age 44, is a furniture maker.

At the same time, he is involved in animal husbandry, which is very helpful in covering the young family's costs. Having launched this business with a starting capital of 20,000 som (KGS), Razhabali made \u200b\u200bevery effort to make it successful.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Rhoda will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Amani group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":928589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-27T03:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lonah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rhoda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":91000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":91000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":92455,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-27T18:44:39Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362818,"name":"Khurshedjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0425\u0443\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0434\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440. \u041e\u043d \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u0438  \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435. \u0415\u043c\u0443 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442. \u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0425\u0443\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0434\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439. \u0425\u0443\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0434\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u044f\u0434\u043e\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438.","en":"Khurshedjon works in agriculture.

Since 2003 Bakyt started fattening and selling cattle with an initial investment amount of 23,000 som (KGS). Because of the tenacity and perseverance in the quest for a decent life for his family Bakyt worked tirelessly. Today, his farm with cows and sheep is developing successfully and brings a monthly income of about 20,000 som (KGS) from the sale of meat and dairy products.\r\n\r\nFor further development of his business Bakyt has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS for the purchase of bulls for fattening.

With this loan, she envisages making a profit of 95 000 FCFA which she will use to contribute to family expenses, pay the interest on her loan and reinvest the rest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":928612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":22763.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874376,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":22763.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283196,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-19T08:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":22763.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424706,"comment":null},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":22763.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139971,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-25T08:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":22763.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756949,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":22763.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251722,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.58,"processed_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":22763.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410764,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-24T16:21:46Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362832,"name":"Pio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pio is 58 years old and has worked as a farmer for 15 years.

He says so because farming requires a lot of patience, hard work, optimism and \u2013 of course \u2013 funds. Farmers do not know from one season to the next if they will be able to make a profit or not, because potential calamities that might destroy their precious farms are always looming on the horizon.\r\n\r\nDespite the precarious nature of farming, Alan is very optimistic about operating his business.

Fuaifatu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Fuaifatu is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Fuaifatu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to the borrower's house.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":928640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

","en":"Mankanay is 54 years old, married, and has raised two children. During the Soviet times, Mankanay milked cows at a collective farm, while her husband operated a combine harvester. After collective farms ceased to exist, Mankanay and her husband decided to start their own farm, raising and selling animals. They started out in 1995, with 20,000 KGS, and today their farm brings in 10,000 KGS per month from sales of dairy and meat. Also, Mankanay grows various crops for the animals on her own land, allowing her to save money on feed. With the goal of increasing the number of heads of cattle on her farm, Mankanay has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 125,000 KGS, to purchase additional animals. Income from the loan will be used to expand her farm.

She lives with her husband and children in Sanoubougou I, one of the working-class neighborhoods in the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nSitan has worked for ten years buying and selling firewood and smoked fish. She has a good reputation in this business and receives many orders, especially during the cold season, but she does not have sufficient resources to fulfill all her orders. Thus, she needs an eighth individual loan to buy 15 cartloads of firewood in the communities surrounding the city of Sikasso and 20 cases of smoked fish in Gao (the seventh administrative region of Mali) in order to meet the needs of her ever increasing clientele.\r\n\r\nHer goods (firewood and smoked fish) are sold from her home and in the local  market.\r\nShe has been collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso for more than five years and has benefited from four group loans with a group of the women in her neighborhood, and she is now on her eighth individual loan. All her previous loans have been properly reimbursed.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to make a monthly profit of 150,000 FCFA, which she will use to cover her basic expenses, contribute to the family's expenses and pay the interest on the loan. She will invest the rest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":928672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy firewood and smoked fish.

Benerd is the facilitator of the Luyeshe SHG group. This  group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program.\r\n\r\nBenerd takes care of six children at home. He joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for his family. In the recent 2011 season, Benerd had a good maize yield, harvesting 12 bags on 1 acre of land.

is a 32-year-old, young man who is married with one daughter. He is a taxi driver with a low income. Ahmad wants to repair his taxi by changing its doors but he does not have enough money.Therefore he needs a loan from FATEN. When Ahmad gets the loan, he will replace the taxi doors and this will improve the condition of his taxi. Ahmad will work extra hours to increase his income and provide his family with better living conditions. Ahmad is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n \r\n\r\n

Njomo is the facilitator of the group. This  group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program. \r\n\r\nNjomo joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for his family. In the recent 2011 season, Njomo had a very good maize yield, harvesting 10 bags on 1\/2 an acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Njomo was only able to harvest 3 bags of maize on 1\/2 an acre of land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Njomo and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Njomo will educate his children, ensure food security, and invest in livestock rearing. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Muchanja Farmers group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":928700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-27T03:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rachael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Njomo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":32900,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":33825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681053,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-13T19:48:15Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362899,"name":"Sa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sa is a 32-year-old woman living in the town of Satupaitea Vaega.

Caroline is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala North region of Uganda. For the past 3 years, Caroline has been working hard to manage her poultry farm, which sells chicken. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Caroline has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more chicken for resale, and will help Caroline to generate greater profits and pay school fees for herself. Caroline hopes that in the future she will be able to study catering. \r\n\r\nCaroline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Caroline's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

The loan will be used to buy food to cook for resale, and will help Juliet to generate greater profits and open up another shop that does hairdressing. Juliet hopes that in the future she will be able to own a salon business. \r\n\r\nJuliet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Juliet's future prospects by helping her improve her business.

Lazia is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala North region of Uganda. She is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past two years, Lazia has been working hard to manage her small shop, which sells shoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Lazia has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more shoes for resale, and will help Lazia generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Lazia hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nLazia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Lazia's future prospects by teaching her how to save.

The loan will be used to buy food for resale, and will help Shalon generate greater profits and buy books to help her through her studies. Shalon hopes that in the future she will be able to study nursing. \r\n\r\nShalon is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

Most of Bushenyi's indigenous people are engaged in agriculture as a source of livelihood.\r\nFarming for both commercial and subsistence purposes, is a handed down practice in Bushenyi and one will be hard pressed not to find a family that is not bearing a hand in the aforementioned.\r\nOn occasion, some seasons play havoc with farmer\u2019s harvests. Other adverse seasons spell stagnation in terms of planting as there is barely rainfall. This however has not made any of Bushenyi's farmers waver in their determination to be the preeminent food providing district in Uganda.\r\nAnybody who has been to the many food markets in the nation's capital-Kampala can bear witness to the fact that most food being sold is from Bushenyi.\r\nHow would one know and tell? Well the language being spoken by the food traders on their big trucks is alien in Kampala.That would be one way of identifying these traders.\r\nThe Bushenyi farmers too have a different type of bananas, a high favored staple food in Kampala, which they sell in these flourishing markets. Their bananas are really big. As in really BIG. And these sell quite highly in Kampala.\r\nOne farmer from Bushenyi who has for the last decade been involved in this trade is 49 year old Abasi, a happily married father of eight children.\r\nHe has been doing great business in this trade and it explains his relative longevity.\r\nHe sells his foods not only in Kampala, but in most towns of Western Uganda.\r\nHe says that a sense of unwavering hard work and determination has enabled him to carve out a significant niche for his business.\r\nMonth in, month out, he says his sales returns are to the tune of 150,000 Ugandan shillings.\r\nAbasi intends to use his Kiva loan to purchase high grade manure for his

It is in this hot, arid climate that we find the client's home and business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":928810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise for the Christmas season (shoes)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:04:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":102.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":104.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":108.76},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":115.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":116.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":122.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":131.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":140.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":145.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.47,"local_amount":102.96,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":106.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250735429,"comment":null},{"amount":40.22,"local_amount":104.92,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":108.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142477,"comment":null},{"amount":41.69,"local_amount":108.76,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":112.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271069,"comment":null},{"amount":44.3,"local_amount":115.58,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":119.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993720,"comment":null},{"amount":44.85,"local_amount":116.98,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:55Z","rounded_local_amount":121.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601625,"comment":null},{"amount":46.92,"local_amount":122.4,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":126.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090758,"comment":null},{"amount":317.55,"local_amount":828.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":859.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287221858,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-14T20:02:07Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362980,"name":"Maria Elpidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Elpidia se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, desde hace m\u00e1s de 7 a\u00f1os que tiene este medio de vida.

Angelina, a member and representative for the group, is found in the photograph in the first row, second from the left, in a long-sleeved black polo shirt, blue jeans, and hair tied in a ponytail. \r\n\r\nShe has had a confectionery business, specifically, a chocolate business, for three years.  She comments that she learned this trade by helping her sister-in-law with this type of work.  She produces the chocolates and chocolate truffles in her house in the mornings, and in the afternoons she packages them and distributes them to the stores and handicraft markets.  She buys her merchandise once a week from various distributors.  \r\n\r\nShe comments that the business is going very well, and she has quite a few customers.  However, when her sales fall off, she produces \"cuchuflis,\" a cylindrical cookie with a sweet caramel filling.  She says that she is making a plan to sell her products in a handicraft market where she can set up a sales post.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will buy supplies for her business making chocolates, chocolate truffles and cuchuflis.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her business to other townships, and to do this she needs to buy a vehicle so that she could get around.  In addition, she would like to be able to provide jobs for people who need them.  \r\n\r\nAngela lives with her husband and their two daughters aged 4 and 2.  The oldest attends school; she can arrange her schedule according to her free time.  \r\n\r\nAngela is very happy and grateful for the loan obtained through Fondo Esperanza, since it has allowed her to invest in her business.  In addition, she feels very comfortable with her communal bank, since she has gained confidence and respect for the members.  \r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n is seated at the mouth of the Biob\u00edo river, one of the largest in the country, in the Biob\u00edo region in the south of Chile. This region has played an important role in our country, being at the center of important battles, such as the War of Arauco, and related settlements, since it borders the Mapuche territory. The city is currently undergoing significant economic and demographic development.   It is increasingly considered as one of the most important urban, demographic, administrative, financial, and commercial centers in Chile, after Santiago and Valparaiso.

He lives with his partner, and they have seven children, two of whom are now adults and on their own. The other five are ages 19, 17, 12, 9, and 2.  They live together in their own house, that they managed to buy with a lot of effort. \r\n\r\nPedro grows rice on a small farm that he rents. He takes advantage of local conditions; in the rainy season he plants his crop, and provides the necessary care to see his plants grow little by little. \r\n\r\nHe has been doing this work for two years, with the help of some of his children, who are learning more and more about the work each day. This way, their father can provide them with both learning and food.  It's going very well for him, as he has good sales. He is a supplier to three important mills in the area, who are always waiting for him to bring them his crop to sell, as he produces one of the best crops in the area.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, it was very complicated for him to carry out this work, as he didn't have a lot of knowledge. But he took advantage of various workshop sessions, and learned everything he needed. \r\n\r\nHe doesn't consider himself an expert, but the knowledge he has allows him to harvest a good crop. In the future he wishes to have his own small farm, as when he rents, this takes away part of his earnings. \r\n\r\nIn addition, he wishes to set up a small store in his house, where his partner can sell merchandise and generate additional income for their household finances. \r\n\r\nThis will be his fourth loan with MFP. He is very happy to know that he will have a loan, since in this way, he will feel secure in moving forward with his business. Moreover, he is committed to once again making his instalment payments. \r\n\r\nWith the amount applied for, 1,500 soles, he will buy products for stocking the store in his house, and also spend a bit to pay laborers, so that he can maintain his small farm.

Only 6 of the children are living together with their parents.\r\n\r\nSonia is excited to be taking her 4th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business. She runs a beauty salon and a miscellaneous store. She will buy some products such as beauty and cosmetic products, clothes, accessories and many other items for economic activities. She will use the profits to reinvest in her business.
