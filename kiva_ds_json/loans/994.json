Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She has the support of her oldest daughter, who is also learning the trade, which makes her proud. \r\n\r\nShe believes her business is profitable because of the demand she has and the income she makes.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work as it provides substantial income to pay the household expenses and to provide a better quality of life for her children, but what she doesn't enjoy about her work is that she has to work until late at night to finish and deliver the orders on the days requested. But this doesn't discourage her and she would like to expand her business, installing more sewing machines and hiring personnel. \r\n\r\nThis would be her third loan with the institution MFP. She is very pleased to have the working capital thanks to the institution and in that way be able to deliver the jobs she has outstanding. She is also very pleased with her group for the kind treatment she receives. \r\n\r\nWith the loan requested of 1200 nuevos soles, she will invest it entirely in buying sewing materials such as fabric and thread, searching for low prices by buying with cash and in high volume.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1233967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy fabric and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-15T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-15T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":175.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":192.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":191.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":206.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":214.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.6,"local_amount":175.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":181.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053845,"comment":null},{"amount":76.06,"local_amount":192.15,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":198.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188810,"comment":null},{"amount":75.77,"local_amount":191.41,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":197.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572710,"comment":null},{"amount":81.72,"local_amount":206.45,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":213.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122376,"comment":null},{"amount":84.77,"local_amount":214.16,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":221.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868194,"comment":null},{"amount":87.08,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":227.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577014,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T09:58:23Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495397,"name":"Rosa Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa Elena de cincuenta y cuatro a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus  hijos en casa propia.

She has 10 years of experience in this business, which is set up on the first floor of her house in a warm and comfortable environment.\r\n\r\nShe considers it a good business because they're products that don't need a lot of manual labor except for the application of the lubricants on the vehicles.  She does this by hiring specialized personnel in the field, making hers a profitable business.\r\n\r\nCurrently she has noticed some increase in sales, which motivates her to buy more merchandise to keep her business well stocked.  She hopes to continue working with her customary enthusiasm because her long-term goal is to expand her business with more services.

She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php12, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products.

This will increase sales and increase the family's income so they will have improved living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1235750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase basic groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2012-11-15T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-15T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hanan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113.51},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":115.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":117.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":119.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":121.6},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":123.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":128.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":132.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":134.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":137.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.53},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.04},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":346.48,"local_amount":346.48,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":346.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339615133,"comment":null},{"amount":119.53,"local_amount":119.53,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-21T09:06:36Z","rounded_local_amount":119.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347793895,"comment":null},{"amount":121.6,"local_amount":121.6,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-23T08:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":121.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365609358,"comment":null},{"amount":249.57,"local_amount":249.57,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":249.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373561073,"comment":null},{"amount":128.04,"local_amount":128.04,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":128.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382380034,"comment":null},{"amount":130.27,"local_amount":130.27,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":130.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391486301,"comment":null},{"amount":132.53,"local_amount":132.53,"processed_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":132.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400465208,"comment":null},{"amount":271.98,"local_amount":271.98,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":271.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410194650,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T09:30:00Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T18:24:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495994,"name":"Theobal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theobal is 33 years old.

In addition to this, she will need to reserve enough capital to hire day laborers to try to lighten the load of the distinct agricultural jobs. \r\nDay to day she gets up very early with the objective of achieving a future land purchase in the city and to build a house for the comfort of her children. She has seven loans with MFP and this time she is asking for $775 to purchase Copperwood plants, grafts from cacao trees and sacks of organic fertilizer and part of the money will be used to hire day laborers. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1235230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase copperwood plants, grafts from a cacao plant, sacks of organic fertilizer and to hire day workers.

She sells her retail goods for cash and credit to a mixed clientele out of her home, while traveling, and at the M\u00e9dine S\u00e9gou marketplace. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mariam hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 65,000 FCFA, which will be used to reinvest in her business and to support the education of the children in her household. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1234997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy secondhand clothes for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-15T23:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-15T23:10:01Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciss\u00e9          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayini       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":290.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":290.63,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":150274.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103138,"comment":null},{"amount":290.62,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":150274.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243417,"comment":null},{"amount":290.63,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":150274.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339625001,"comment":null},{"amount":290.62,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":150274.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179899,"comment":null},{"amount":290.63,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150274.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922700,"comment":null},{"amount":290.62,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":150274.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636241,"comment":null},{"amount":290.63,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":150274.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029772,"comment":null},{"amount":290.62,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":150274.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T12:25:05Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496019,"name":"Augustine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Augustine is a 52-year-old married man living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She started with consumer goods such as soft drinks, toiletries and grocery items which are the requirement of every house, and also sweet items for the children. After passing through different phases, her store is now fully stocked with items of daily use and she doesn\u2019t want to lose any customer by saying no to any of their demands. \r\n\r\nYasmain is a responsible mother of five and eager to fulfill their everyday expenditures including food, clothing and education. She has enhanced her business with the support of Kashf Foundation as she has been in association with Kashf for seven years. She is amongst the top loyal customers of Kashf. Now she requested a loan of 45,000 PKR to buy additional items including stock of rice, grains, sugar and other grocery items in bulk from the market at wholesale prices. She will then be able to manage increasing demand efficiently. She intends to utilize the earned profits for the betterment of her family members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":474.44,"image":{"id":1235785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

This is how Jos\u00e9 started out in this activity and seeing that it produced good income with much effort he bought a boat and a used outboard motor.  He heads out to sea for two days of fishing to bring in product.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to repair the boat\u2019s motor because it\u2019s shut down and will not start up again.  Without a motor in perfect condition he\u2019s unable to go out fishing and this is his source of income to support his family.  His wish is to buy a new motor and new fishing equipment, to build his house because where he lives now isn\u2019t his and that his children to go school and prepare themselves for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1235322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to repair his outboard motor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-11-16T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-16T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Erasmo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":44.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":58.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.09,"local_amount":60.09,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":60.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990228,"comment":null},{"amount":47.87,"local_amount":47.87,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":47.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331970533,"comment":null},{"amount":48.18,"local_amount":48.18,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:20:51Z","rounded_local_amount":48.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517256,"comment":null},{"amount":48.64,"local_amount":48.64,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":48.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069090,"comment":null},{"amount":40.08,"local_amount":40.08,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356495355,"comment":null},{"amount":355.14,"local_amount":355.14,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":355.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525309,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T05:49:28Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495730,"name":"Richard Rafael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Richard, de 37 a\u00f1os de edad, habitante de la ciudad de Le\u00f3n , casado, padre de 2 hijos , de oficio comerciante, se dedica la venta de repuestos y reparaci\u00f3n de Bicicletas.

She began her business because she wanted to raise income to support herself and her family. She works at the business every day.  She starts preparing her cookery at 4:30 a.m., and she does not rest until the food has been finished and taken to market, to prepare for the next day. She says her cookery business is doing well. Out of the food she prepares, she feeds her household. \r\n\r\nMamie requires a loan in order to buy more bags of rice, oil, and cooking seasonings.

She would like to buy an overlock machine (a serger). To be able to afford the purchase, she took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor, thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

She lives with Israel, who is a transportation worker and is the father of their 5 children whom they love dearly. They live together comfortably in their own home. Julia sells different types and flavors of candy in the mornings, setting up a table in front of their house where she attends her customers in a friendly and courteous way. She started her business more than 2 years ago with money that she had saved, and up until now she has run it by herself, on occasions with the help of her daughter. She feels that her business is profitable because of the money it makes, and the fact that it is the only one of its kind in the area, meaning that there is a high demand for it. Before she set up her business, she wanted to be a productive person and earn a living for herself so that she would not have to depend completely on her partner and could help out with household expenses. She also wanted to be able to stay at home and take care of her young children. Therefore, after seeing the results that her business has brought, she wants to continue and with the profits combined with a future loan, buy another transportation vehicle.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has been running this business for the past 20 years. She works at the business every day, smoking the fish from 8:00 p.m. until 3:00 a.m. and taking the fish to the market around 7:30 a.m., not resting until the fish is sold.  Her business is the only income she has. She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation problems between the place where she purchases the raw fish to her house and a poor road network.\r\n\r\nBetty has requested a loan to buy more raw fish to expand her business.

She is friendly and sociable, and knows how to get on people's good side with her charisma. She is married to Israel, who makes a living in transportation and is the father of their three children. They all live comfortably in their own home that they built with a lot of hard work. Mar\u00eda makes a living as a seamstress, a trade she learned at a vocational center when she was young. She started with a sewing machine doing work for her customers, who left satisfied and recommended her to others. She also sells fish in the mornings at her neighborhood market. She does her sewing work from her home, where customers come as she tends to them amicably. She considers her business to be quite lucrative because of the profits she makes and the demand for her handiwork. Up to the moment, she works on her own, but on occasion her daughter helps out in her free time. She decided to start her business by taking out a loan because she needed a trade to generate her own income, in addition to the pleas of her neighbors who wanted to have a good seamstress nearby. But because of her age she gets somewhat tired from being in the same sewing position, so with her profits she wants to invest in a little grocery store. This will be her 19th loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she hopes with this loan she will be able to fulfill her objectives. She says that she enjoys working with her community bank because she knows her fellow members and considers them to be good and supportive people.

from Kiva several times. Last year he built a greenhouse for the seedlings where he installed heating which has raised his income. He used to buy the seedlings before which was not always of good quality. Right now he grows everything himself.

This is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of the region, being the most important city of the Chilean Central Valley.  There is a curious reference to Talca that exists in Chile: the phrase \"Talca, Paris, and London.\"  Among the myths on this matter some say that this is a derivation of what was originally said by an Englishman, \"Talca looks like London,\" for the abundant fog that frequently covers the city during the winter season, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1235868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

Constituye el centro administrativo, econ\u00f3mico y cultural de la regi\u00f3n, siendo la ciudad m\u00e1s importante del Valle Central chileno. Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Maria is part of the Mis Sue\u00f1os (My Dreams) communal bank in the city of Talca.  For ten years she has made a living in the field of baking and selling fried food, especially empanadas, tortillas, bread, sopaipillas, hot dogs with salads, and french fries.  She sells her products and customers come to her home to buy and sometimes they advise her to deliver her products to stores.  She equipped a place in her house to better tend to her customers.  She works from Monday to Saturday and she sets her schedule according to her availability.  She says that the goods and supplies that she is going to need she buys directly from supermarkets and\/or distributers, since they are the places in which she finds the merchandise at low cost, therefore financially convenient. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she is going to buy oil, lard, yeast, flour, potatoes, ketchup, salt, and napkins, among other items.  One of Maria's goals is to get a vehicle so that she can travel more comfortably and at the same time buy her merchandise without worrying how she is going to carry it, in addition to it allowing her to escape the heat in the summer season.\r\n\r\nMaria lives with her 14-year-old daughter who is in school.  Her work and personal dreams are to get a vehicle in order to buy more easily, and at a family level her dream is to give her daughter a good life and a good future in school.  She is very grateful and happy for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza because it opened a working door to her and will allow her to invest in her business and also in her personal growth since she has learned to organize and distribute her income and investments in a better way.  In regard to the communal bank that she is part of, she says that very good communication and unity exists within it. \r\n\r\nTalca belongs to the region of Maule, located in the center area of the country.  It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of the region, being the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  There exists peculiar reference to Talca in Chile: the phrase \"Talca, Paris, London.\"  Among the myths on this matter, some say that is a derivation of what was originally said by an Englishman, \"Talca looks like London,\" for the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in the winter season, similarly to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1235882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the year 2010, five poor, illiterate rural women of Mahulpada village in Titilagarh Block in the Bolangir district of Odisha, India, formed a Joint Liability Group named Saraswati with an objective to support their family businesses by taking loans from Mahashakti Foundation for the over all development of their families.\r\n\r\nKuntala, about 37 years old, is one among the members who is sitting second from the right with a raised hand. Kuntala is married and resides in a small hut with her five-member family comprising her husband, two sons and one daughter. \r\n\r\nAll members of Saraswati group belong to very poor backgrounds. The community of Kuntala especially has a separate establishment in the village. The main source of livelihood of this community is weaving of bamboo baskets of various varieties and selling them in the market. The people of this community are far away from basic needs like education, shelter, health facilities, etc. due to poverty and rural base. \r\n\r\nThe business of Kuntala (weaving of bamboo baskets) is a traditional business of their community. Previously, the inhabitants of this community themselves collected raw bamboo from the nearest forest for weaving of baskets. But due to forest degradation, now they have to travel far away for purchasing of raw bamboo. Kuntala and her husband combine to do the processing work and weaving of baskets like kula, tupa, kurli, bhuga, kulei, garna, talei, parla, etc. of different sizes. During marriage season there are heavy demands for these products. They sell the products weekly in the nearest weekly market of the town. Some traders also regularly come to this village to purchase bamboo products. Kuntala earns a monthly profit of INR 2,000 from her business. \r\n\r\nCurrently, there is a growing demand for this products and traders are used to supplying this to various parts of the country. So Kuntala wants to purchase more raw bamboo from this loan to work for a longer period without any interruption. She also wants to procure some ready-made products from other weavers.

The lady sitting middle in the photo raising her hand is Alibha. She is 39 years of old and lives with her husband, two sons, 20 and 14 years old, and her daughter, age 12. All her children are continuing their studies. Her elder son is studying for an engineering degree. Although Alibha is a permanent resident of Titilagarh, due to a residential problem her family is residing in a rented house in the same town.\r\n\r\nAlibha has run a mixture and fried peanut supply business for the last seven years with the hand-holding support of her husband. She purchases raw peanuts in bulk, fries them, makes small packets in polythene and her husband supplies them to retailers at a wholesale price. Apart from this, she also supplies mixtures at wholesale. Alibha usually supplies 300 kilograms of fried peanuts to the retailers in a week. She purchases stock of peanuts from three wholesale markets 200 kms away. She gets a monthly income of INR 5,000 from the existing business. \r\n\r\nOut of this income she is hardly able to manage her household and the educational expenses of her children, especially since her elder son is studying for his engineering degree at a distant place. Money poses a hindrance for managing all these expenses from her scanty income. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Alibha wants to purchase more stock of raw peanuts from the present loan. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she usually has to replenish her stock frequently.\r\n\r\nAlibha hopes to save enough for building a good house of her own as the present house is a rented one. She has also dreams to give better education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Ranjulata, Bhanumati, Puspanjali and Surendri, who are running meals hotel, screen printing, tea stall and daily needs businesses respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1235893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","use":"To pay for purchasing of peanuts in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-16T15:00:47Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-16T15:00:47Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhanumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alibha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Surendri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T21:14:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495843,"name":"Lidia Maritza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lidia Maritza de treinta y cinco a\u00f1os de edad vive junto compa\u00f1ero de vida Andr\u00e9s y sus tres hijos ; ella se dedica a la venta de art\u00edculos varios y ropa como camisas, pantalones, vestidos entre otros, tiene varios a\u00f1os con el negocio y se ha hecho de mucha experiencia que le permite obtener las mejores ganancias, comercia en el mercado de la localidad y se ha hecho de mucha clientela pues todo lo que vende es de calidad, a buenos precios y con un excelente servicio; Lidia es una mujer admirable, le encanta su trabajo siempre est\u00e1 a la expectativa de nuevas oportunidades y nuevas ideas para superarse y sobresalir, piensa que el m\u00e1s grande \u00e9xito solo lo gana el que no se rinde en la batalla, ahora que tiene mucha demanda desea invertir m\u00e1s y extender el negocio  pero necesita de un apoyo de capital por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar ropa, papel higi\u00e9nico, jabones etc. Lidia Maritza tiene buenas referencias de pago y tiene experiencia crediticia, por eso se hace totalmente responsable del pago del financiamiento, y adem\u00e1s tiene fe que as\u00ed podr\u00e1 darle a su familia una vida m\u00e1s plena como se la merecen.","en":"Lidia Maritza is 35 years old and lives together with her life partner Andr\u00e9s and their three children.

Odisha, India.Their primary objective was to avail credit from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their existing businesses. \r\n\r\nRanju, age about 40 years, is one of them. The lady standing in the photo, raising her hand is Ranju. She lives with her husband, three daughters, 18, 15 and 13 years old, and a son, 14 years old. All her children are continuing their studies in the local college.\r\n\r\nRanju has been running a small general store in her locality for the last eight years with the help of her husband. She sells general grocery items like rice, oil, sugar, lentils, biscuits, soft drinks, toffees, etc. Her net monthly income from the existing business is INR 4,000. Out of this income she has been able to contribute some part for household expenditures like the educational expenses of her children. \r\n\r\nRanju purchases stock for her business daily from the wholesalers of the town. As per her statement, she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase stock of her business from this loan by purchasing items like lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing costs and save time as she normally has to refill her stock on daily basis.\r\n\r\nOut of the extra income, Ranju wants to save some money and dreams to provide better education to her children as she believes that education is the pillar of all success.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Jayanti, Sanjukta, Lalima, Sanjukta-1 and Suprabha who are running egg stall, barber shop and tent house businesses. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1235913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for purchasing of lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-16T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-16T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suprabha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T11:39:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496166,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine lives in Kampala, Uganda.

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is married with four children, and all her children go to school. She takes care of one additional family member (a sister). \r\n\r\nShe sells charcoal at the market. She sells her products on a retail basis. She has been in this business for the last seven years. She works seven days a week.  \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of Uganda shillings 500,000 from MCDT \u2013 SACCO to buy more bags of charcoal.

Years ago, she and her husband decided to move to the city of Barranquilla so that their children could study there. Since life in this city is more expensive, Bertha decided to open her own business in food sales. Her business grew in this city, but six years ago, for unrelated reasons, the family had to move to the city of Cartagena de Indias, where they live and work today. Bertha sells a variety of fried and grilled foods. She works Tuesday through Sunday until 10 p.m. \r\n\r\nBertha is requesting a Kiva loan, her second with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy a stove to expand her business as well as buy supplies so she can prepare bigger quantities of food. She wants to take advantage of the upcoming holiday season, which is a very good time for her business. With her previous loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n, Bertha was able to improve the infrastructure of her business. She added a display window and was able to buy basic ingredients in larger quantities at discounted prices. With these she was able to keep a good supply of foods on display for customers, which helped increase her profits. \r\n\r\nBertha's goal for the future is to turn her business into a full restaurant.

He is a single man who lives in a traditional family with his cousin in Sanoubougou II, a working-class district of the city of Sikasso. \r\n\r\nHaving not had the opportunity to pursue his studies, Hamidou learned early on the business of buying and selling mobile phones and accessories (skin cases, batteries, chargers, headphones, etc.) over 10 years ago. He conducts his business in his own shop at the Sikasso bus station, and his clientele consists mainly of travelers and carriers. He is in high demand due to the quality of his merchandise. \r\n\r\nEager to meet the needs of his growing customer base, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, where he has previously received five loans, all correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a sixth loan to go to Bamako to purchase 60 mobile phones of various brands, 10 boxes of skin cases, about 15 chargers, 30 packs of memory cards, 25 boxes of batteries, 15 dozen set of headphones in different styles, and an assortment of watches and belts. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to earn a monthly profit of 175,000 FCFA, which he will use primarily to help with the household expenses and to pay the interest on the loan. Any remainder will be reinvested in his activity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1235225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy mobile phones and accessories for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-16T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-16T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamidou Ousmane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103142,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243422,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339625005,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179904,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922704,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636246,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T17:23:40Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:35:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496169,"name":"Ramon Eduardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Ram\u00f3n tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado, tiene 3 hijos, reside en compa\u00f1\u00eda de 2 de sus hijos menores y esposa  en  el municipio de Tela, Departamento de Atl\u00e1ntida.\nRam\u00f3n hace 9 a\u00f1os que se dedica al transporte de personas a trav\u00e9s de un taxi, el transita la ciudad en busca de pasajeros pero tambi\u00e9n tiene contratos con personas asalariadas y a estudiantes.\nActualmente ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo por la cantidad de 21,000 Lempiras los que piensa invertir en la reparaci\u00f3n de su veh\u00edculo a traves del cambio de amortiguadores, compra de llantas y reparaciones menores.\nConsidera que al mantener la unidad de transporte en buen estado sus clientes viajan mas c\u00f3modos y les ofrece un mejor servicio.\nEn el futuro Ram\u00f3n espera aumentar su clientela, sus ingresos y contribuir a mejorar la calidad de vida a su familia.\n","en":"Ram\u00f3n, 48, is married and has three children; he lives with two of the minor ones and with his wife in Tela, Atl\u00e1ntida Department.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her prepared food business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy more ingredients for meals, like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLourdes hopes to grow her business and dreams that her children will have a good future, by the grace of God.

The children are still young.  Their living conditions are very difficult.  He has worked in the fields from an early age in order to earn money to support his family.  The family owns a 5 acre plot of land.  Together with his wife and parents Elyor grows grain crops.  He has been in this business for more then 10 years.  His caring wife helps him to run the business.  He sells the harvest directly to local residents for a lower price than at the market.  A large part of the population in this area purchases wheat, then grinds flour at the mill and bakes bread for personal use.  Elyor plans to buy livestock in order to grow his business and thereby increase his income.  He is asking for a loan of 3000 somoni for the purchase of livestock.  Elyor is waiting for your kindness.

is a single mother of a six-year-old boy with special needs. She came from the Dominican Republic seven years ago with a clear goal of becoming a productive citizen. Her son started the Early Intervention Program at the age of two, so she needed to work in something that allowed her to be at home caring for her son.  She has always been passionate about education and knew that she wanted to do something in that field, so she decided to open a home-based daycare service. She was able to procure all the necessary licenses and the business has been in service for three years now. She currently cares for 17 kids and employs two women who help her care for the children. Magali looks after her business with passion and dedication because she wants to give the children the same quality care that she gives her own child.  Magali is also studying part-time at a local community college in the Bronx, majoring in Early Childhood Education. Her goal is to finish her studies and open a full service day care center. Magali is asking for a loan to help her buy new material and equipment for her home-based business, which will increase the quality of the service she offers. Some of the things she needs are a desktop computer to help school-age children with their homework and for her to be able to do the daily menu online; new tables, chairs and beds."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2932.26,"image":{"id":1236141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child

She resides with her husband and their children in a nuclear family in Hamdallaye, a working-class district in Sikasso City. After having run many businesses without success, Ms. Mani became familiar with this business of buying and selling Wax 'pagnes' (the colorful cloth of western Africa) and plasticware (buckets, basins, cups, etc.) over three years ago. She purchases her goods in Bobo (Burkina Faso) and then resells them door to door in her district, at the big market, and at the M\u00e9dine market. Her customer base is composed essentially of housekeepers. She is much in demand by her customers for the quality of her goods. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso over a year ago.

out and decided to build a secure future for their families with their contributions. They formed a group named Omm Santi to avail credit from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing business. Purnimadei is the one standing second from the right with her hand raised in the photo. She is 45 years old and lives with her husband and two sons, 27 and 25 years of age, who help in her business. Purnimadei hails from a traditional cloth weaving community. For the last 40 years, she has been running a cloth weaving business with her husband. Now she has two hand looms for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from trader in a village that is 20 km away. They prepare 80 to 100 pieces from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. Purnimadei does the initial processing of the yarn to make it ready for weaving and after that, her husband and sons fit it to the hand loom and weave the sari. They only weave saris because of the demand in the market. Her family works around 8-10 hours a day and weaves one piece of sari from each hand loom. Purnimadei sells her products to the local traders on a weekly basis. She earns a monthly income of Rs.6,000, which is not sufficient to maintain her family. With the loan, she wants to buy a thread\/yarn in bulk. Purchasing more stock at a time will help her to reduce the purchasing & transportation costs of the raw materials. Purnimadei wishes to grow her business and save enough to complete the construction of her half-constructed house.\r\n\r\nSantidei, Padmabati and Somatuladei are the other members of the group and they also have cloth weaving businesses. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase thread\/yarn in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TUKLA,KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-16T20:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-16T20:30:14Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santidei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnimadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Somatuladei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":144000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":144000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T02:41:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496449,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is from Poblacion, Baliangao.

The resulting profit from each planting is enough to acquire seeds and organic fertilizers, and she says that her crops have been larger and larger because of her increasing profits.  She says that the primary problem is the lack of working capital to have better production, but she is doing it slowly.\r\n\r\nThese months are the time when she is busiest working on her coffee care, cleaning and trimming, and spreading fertilizers, but what she can do is not enough, and therefore, she is asking for your support.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to become a large scale agriculturalist, for which she works with dedication.  This is her fourth loan with MFP.  She promises to pay her loan back punctually, just as with her previous loans.  \u201cLos Clavelitos de Shankivironi\u201d is the name of her communal banking group, and she feels happy to work with these responsible group members.

Her loan requests were rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the dairy business. They have have three milk cows. Patman milks the cows, produces cheese, and sells it locally at the open market at a good price. Her mother is provided with a pension that brings them 125 Laris per month, which is not enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nPatman has requested a loan from Credo in order to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Patman will begin trading on clothing. She plans to purchase clothing in Turkey from wholesalers and sell these items among the villagers as well as in the nearby villages.

is Vicenta, 36, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Edgardo, a businessman. Vicenta is also a mother to her children. Together with her husband, Vicenta manages their household while operating her business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVicenta operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. She also sells RTW (ready-to-wear clothing) for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy larger quantities of ingredients, like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and other products she uses in her prepared foods business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nVicenta hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving a good life to her children, by the grace of God. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1236471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for ingredients and products she uses to prepare meals for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-16T21:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-16T21:20:14Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960377,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095099,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.04,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484249,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036763,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T23:54:44Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496477,"name":"Phoy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phoy lives in a rural village of Kandal province\u2019s Kandal Stoeng district, in Cambodia.

The couple have five children who are 9, 8, 5, 4 and 2 years old.  They all live together in their own home which is located in an indigenous community in the central jungle.  Hermelinda works very hard.  She started working in the fields 20 years ago.  Over this long period of time, she has acquired 12 plots of land which are located in different parts of her town.  On her land she grows citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons.  She also grows coffee and annatto.  As her crops are located a fair distance from her home, she gets up very early in the morning so that she can get to them on time.\r\n\r\nHermelinda is very good at selling her produce.

She has been farming for 10 years and currently has 9 plots of land on which she grows crops.  She received these plots of land from her community and her parents and uses them to grow coffee, annatto and citrus fruits such as oranges and tangelos.  \"Every year I harvest 1,500 kilos of annatto and I sell each kilo for 4 soles.  It is profitable\", she says.\r\n\r\nJustina's work is very tiring so she receives help from her eldest son.  However, when the day's work is really strenuous she hires day laborers to help with the harvesting.  \"In May sales are good because coffee reaches its highest price\", she says.  In spite of everything, Justina is happy with her work because everything she obtains is the product of her own efforts.

She also takes care of her sister. The family currently lives in a rented house and has access to electricity but not to piped water. Harriet's primary monthly expenses are school fees and rent.\r\n\r\nHarriet has requested a loan of 300,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO in order to buy braids, hair treatments, weaves, and hairsprays.
