They are gentle and friendly people who keep good moods and their peoples' traditions.  They live in the Cumbe en Cuenca parish, and this area enjoys much vegetation and green landscapes.  It's surrounded by mountains, which gives it a special touch.\r\n\r\nAna is one of the members.  She serves as the president of the Nueva Ilusi\u00f3n communal bank and is a part of this group of friends which has formed strong friendship ties with her fellow members.\r\n\r\nAna is 44 years old and is the single mother of five children, ages 27, 21, 18, 11 and 9.  Her two oldest sons work and help her financially.  Her next oldest attends high school and her two youngest attend the local school.  She doesn't have a home of her own and lives with her mother and helps her with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAna is a housewife but she raises and sells Guinea pigs, pigs, and livestock in order to get her family ahead.  She sells the animals within her community, and also works in agriculture and her products are for her family's consumption.  In the evenings she sells tamales and coffee from her home.  All these activities provide her the opportunity to improve her family stability and get her children ahead.  She likes to work in the fields very much because she can stay home and the home does not deteriorate.\r\n\r\nShe used the money from her previous loan to buy animal feed and ingredients for her tamales, from which she obtained some good earnings that she used to pay the household expenses.  She is asking for another loan so she can buy more pigs, Guinea pigs, and ingredients for her coffee and tamale business.\r\n\r\nShe likes the communal bank because the loans allow her to continue growing her business.  The small picture is of a member who was not able to attend when the group photo was taken."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5950,"image":{"id":1350170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-06-02T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-02T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":5950,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Libia Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guifor Edmundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marithza Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Bersabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5933.67,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":741.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":741.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":741.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":741.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":741.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":741.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":741.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":741.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2975.01,"local_amount":2966.84,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2975.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381704190,"comment":null},{"amount":1487.5,"local_amount":1483.42,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1487.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566614,"comment":null},{"amount":1487.49,"local_amount":1483.41,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1487.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815632,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-03T02:35:20Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:32:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":567154,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is 40 years old.

Currently he works making plantain chips, and selling them every day from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. \r\n\r\nHis challenge is that he doesn't have a means of transportation, and this area of the city is very dangerous. He is married and his wife helps him in the business. He has four children, ages 1, 5, 13 and 14. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to improve his quality of life. That is why he wants the loan to buy more plantains, so that he can make more chips, sell to more customers and stores, and improve his

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his wife and children in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement in Azerbaijan. Habil raises cattle, fattens them, and sells them for a profitable price. He has been in this business for four years. He is very kind, caring, and very energetic in his work. After high school, Habil chose not to pursue further studies, but to continue the family tradition and to enter the cattle business. This is a very profitable business, and Habil does it together with his father.\r\n\r\nThey sell meat at the central bazaar for profits. In Azerbaijan, there is a high demand for meat because it is used in a lot of meals, such as kufta (soup), kababs, dolma, etc. His income from this business is 100 AZN per month.

is a 26-year-old housewife.

Due to the large family size and low monthly income, they are facing many problems. Her husband needs additional capital for the growth of his business. Azra has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that she can invest in her husband\u2019s shop.\r\n\r\nWith the loan money, her husband would expand the general store. He would add some more space to it by building one more room. He would also buy a variety of goods like rice, sugar, soap, cereals, milk, and utility items for his general store. This would satisfy his clients more professionally, as well as increase his savings for the better future of his children. The profit amount would be used to expand the business and pay the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAzra and her husband are very hopeful that the loan will be a lucky and productive one for their

They have three buffalo and her husband sells buffalo milk to their neighbors and other people, which is the only source of income for their family. She wants to sell milk, yogurt and butter in the market on a large scale, for which the production should be increased. Shazia is facing a very difficult time as her monthly income is insufficient to meet household expenses. As a member of four-person group, Shazia has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BRAC Pakistan, to buy a new buffalo in order to increase the production of milk and increase her monthly income. After receiving the profits, she is planning to send her children to school. She is very hopeful that the loan will be a productive one for them. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their support.\r\n\r\nNOTE: In the picture Shazia is raising her

is an enterprising woman with many dreams to fulfill.

She loves her family and claims they are her greatest strength and reason for getting up each morning and working hard to generate an income. \r\n\r\nSince 2003, Riffat has been working as a tailor. She provides stitching services in her community. Her eldest daughter also helps her in stitching up dresses. She has excellent stitching skills and, with the money she generates, she has managed to provide a better quality of life for her family. Her greatest wish is to expand her business and to purchase one more sewing machine, as the number of her customers is increasing day by day. However, with only one machine, she cannot easily cope with all her customers on time, and that results in a loss of money and customers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Riffat is asking for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to invest in the purchase of a sewing machine, which will allow her to fulfill the demands of customers more efficiently and to elevate her level of income. With her profit, she will pay the educational expenses of her children. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, near Tanzania. Inconsistent rains, especially recently, have made farming difficult, and the poverty rates in the county are above the Kenyan average. Beekeeping is somewhat new to Kwale, but the passionfruit farms and mangrove forests throughout the area provide excellent sources of nectar for bee colonies. Many farmers  in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives, and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.  \r\n\r\nChitsaka has three children, and has been farming for eight years. She is currently tending to an orange orchard on her land. She is excited to start beekeeping because she sees it as a good source of income, and is looking forward to working with Honey Care because they give very good training.\r\n\r\nChitsaka has created a kindergarten program in her community, and volunteers her time to help teach and care for her pupils. With the income generated from her beehives, Chitsaka plans to sponsor kindergarten pupils, and pay the expenses for those children whose families cannot afford to front the minimal fees needed to buy teaching materials for the young girls and boys. Chitsaka's class is currently taught out of a small room with an unfinished roof, but her hope for the future is to save up enough money to build a proper classroom, so that her pupils have a good space to play and learn.

It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia. \n\nJosephine has had a table business where she has sold dry and fresh fish for the past three years. She works from 7AM to 6PM every day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is less income. She intends to use the loan to buy more fish. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because it helps to support her home.
