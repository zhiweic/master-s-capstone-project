She also enjoys making her favorite dish, which is chicken stew. Due to limited financial resources she was only able to get a high school education, but she would have liked to attend university. That is why she works hard every day so that her children can become respectable people. \r\n\r\nFull of enthusiasm, Emperatriz works as a farmer on her small piece of land. She dedicates around ten hours per day to her business. She believes the reasons why it is going well is because she is a very hard worker and she can count on her husband's support.\r\n\r\nEmperatriz is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she will be able to maintain her crops by purchasing fertilizer and other supplies so that she can obtain a good harvest, which in turn will allow her to continue growing and fighting day by day in order to make her biggest dream come true: to become a homeowner.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":999.25,"image":{"id":1277501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oco\u00f1a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emperatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":999.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2543.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.75,"payment_id":390775234,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T10:21:28Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":517999,"name":"Lindita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lindita is twenty nine years old, married, and expecting a child soon.

This way her children will grow up strong and healthy.\r\n\r\nHer wish is to build her own house; she already has the land, and only needs the house. She wants to provide health, education, and a good diet to her children, and also wants to buy a more modern sewing machine."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1277515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy milk cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Transito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1291.68,"local_amount":1291.68,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1291.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857011,"comment":null},{"amount":108.32,"local_amount":108.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":108.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716585,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T22:54:15Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":518125,"name":"Nilliam","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

is 33 years old. He lives in the village of Kukhi with his family-his wife, two children and his mother. The eldest daughter goes to secondary school. The main source of income for George\u2019s family comes from agricultural activities. They own a milk cow and produce cheese to sell in their village. The family also owns an agricultural plot with an area of two hectares where maize is grown. Most of the harvested products are sold locally. George also owns a tractor and works on canalization.

He is a hard-working and very honest man. He lives together with his partner, Mildre, who has three children, and he raises them as his own children. He lives together with them in his own house, and he wants to give them all the best and a good education, so that they will be prepared for the future. Roberto's work is growing local crops. He takes charge of planting and harvesting on his farm, where he goes out every day to look at his plantings, to care for them, cultivate them and water them. He believes that to have a good harvest, one must put a lot of care into the crops. Recently he also started a business of his own. He works alone, and on some occasions he will contract other people to help him with the planting and harvesting, so that he can have all of his products and his orders on time. He has been doing this work for more than 20 years. \r\n\r\nHe loves everything he does, and in this case where he is getting started, it is no exception, because he enjoys being out in nature, and he doesn't get tired of taking the yuca, plantains, hot peppers, bell peppers and the other products he grows on his farm to sell at the market. In the future, he wants to plant another kind of pepper to vary his production and have more customers. This will be loan number 13 for him with the MFP institution, and thus he is asking for your support so that he can make his plans a reality. At the same time, he is committed once more to fulfilling his payment schedule, as with his previous loans. He also likes being part of his communal bank, since all of its members are very responsible people with a sense of solidarity. \r\n\r\nWith the amount he is requesting, 2000 soles, he will stock the little store he has in his home, so he will buy products and grains, as well as seeds to plant on his farm. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1277522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy products and grains to sell and seeds to plant on his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T19:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T19:10:16Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":215.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":214.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":248.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":257.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":262.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":274.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":286.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.13,"local_amount":215.32,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":219.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573283,"comment":null},{"amount":85.81,"local_amount":214.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":218.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122937,"comment":null},{"amount":95.79,"local_amount":239.49,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":243.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868758,"comment":null},{"amount":99.37,"local_amount":248.42,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":252.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577599,"comment":null},{"amount":103.07,"local_amount":257.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":262.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529831,"comment":null},{"amount":105.13,"local_amount":262.82,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":267.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974862,"comment":null},{"amount":109.92,"local_amount":274.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":279.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996123,"comment":null},{"amount":114.78,"local_amount":286.94,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":291.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863739,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T23:55:25Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":518001,"name":"Gjin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gjin is a forty-four-year-old married father of three children, who are attending school.

lives in the Kericho area of Kenya, which claims a beautiful countryside.

Her biggest challenge is 'insufficient pastures.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Chebirir.' She will use the loan of 20,000 KES requested from Juhudi Kilimo to buy poultry birds for a venture into poultry farming.\r\n\r\nDaisy was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, 'Their monthly repayment rate.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Savings are good for us.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Daisy replied 'Broaden the source of income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Daisy owns a cow and some poultry birds, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and sent the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":181.42,"image":{"id":1277220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy poultry birds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T19:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T19:30:19Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1475.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1514.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1554.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1595.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1638.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1681.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1725.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1771.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1818.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1918.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.42,"local_amount":1473.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1598.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355846160,"comment":null},{"amount":18.88,"local_amount":1510.28,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1638.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768541,"comment":null},{"amount":19.38,"local_amount":1550.2,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1681.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516610,"comment":null},{"amount":19.51,"local_amount":1561.18,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1693.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960212,"comment":null},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":3134.88,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3400.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417015,"comment":null},{"amount":21.44,"local_amount":1715.31,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1860.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980555,"comment":null},{"amount":22.01,"local_amount":1760.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1909.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880556,"comment":null},{"amount":22.59,"local_amount":1807.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1960.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529193,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T20:14:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":517924,"name":"Reynalda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Reynalda, age 35, is a farmer.

is 39 years old. He lives in the small village of Tianeti district with his wife and father who was given a retirement pension. Aleksandre owns a minibus and transports people from his village to the capital city. This is a main source of his monthly income.\r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have 11 milk cows and five calves. They sell milk locally.

She lives with her nephew, who always helps and supports her. They live in a home they own.\r\n\r\nYolanda's business is sewing, a trade she learned by watching and helping her sister in a small shop, where she acquired the necessary knowledge and experience. She decided to start her own business by investing her own capital, her and her late husband's savings. She purchased a sewing machine, which is her main work tool, and started sewing and looking for customers on her own, over fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because it provides her with good earnings.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it generates enough income for her to pay her home expenses, and also because she likes sewing and making lingerie and all types and styles of clothing. On the other hand, she doesn't enjoy the physical exhaustion that comes from staying in the same position for long hours while sewing her work. But she is not disheartened by this, she keeps working and doing her best to continue moving forward. In the future she would like to buy a riveting machine, which would make her job a lot easier and would allow her business to expand. \r\n\r\nThis is her 21st loan with MFP. She is grateful for the financial support she has received and wants to continue having it, which is why she is committed to paying her installments as she did with previous loans. She is also happy with the group she belongs to beacuse she considers its members to be responsible and supportive people. \r\n\r\nShe will invest the requested amount of 1,500 nuevos soles in purchasing sewing materials, such as fabric, elastics, thread, and other items. She will look for the best quality at the lowest price. This will allow her to increase her stock of available materials for her work.

In this way he will be able to provide his parents with better quality of life and continue to strive towards making his greatest dream reality: to have a business of his own.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":399.94,"image":{"id":1277551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy building materials and supplies to build a bathroom at home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.06,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":142.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":163.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":177.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":185.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.06,"local_amount":142.64,"processed_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":145.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031862,"comment":null},{"amount":64.13,"local_amount":160.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":163.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776348,"comment":null},{"amount":65.39,"local_amount":163.49,"processed_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":166.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483166,"comment":null},{"amount":68.43,"local_amount":171.06,"processed_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":174.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889203,"comment":null},{"amount":70.99,"local_amount":177.47,"processed_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:14Z","rounded_local_amount":180.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664116,"comment":null},{"amount":73.94,"local_amount":185.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":188.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.06,"payment_id":390775238,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T00:21:18Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":516799,"name":"Kokue Poty Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 Kokue Poty est\u00e1 conformado por diez integrantes todas son se\u00f1oras ama de casa, integran el comit\u00e9 con un prop\u00f3sito de tener oportunidad de acceder a un cr\u00e9dito, de poder trabajar en conjunto  y as\u00ed salir adelante. \nFatima es parte de este grupo,  quien se dedica a la venta de prendas de segunda mano.

Actualmente vive con sus padres Enrique y Carmen de 46 a\u00f1os y con su hijo de 3 a\u00f1os. Juntos viven en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, su nombre es Gualea, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana conocida como Los Yumbos. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por lo que sus habitantes aprovechan la oportunidad para ofrecer tours, servicio de hospedaje, alimentaci\u00f3n, deportes naturales como cabalgatas, etc. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 2000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos.\nJessica ha sido apoyada por sus padres para cubrir las necesidades de ella y su hijo.

Jessica agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y a Kiva por el apoyo incondicional que prestan al sector rural y a las personas emprendedoras que necesitan apoyo financiero. ","en":"Jessica is a young woman of 21. She became a single mother before she reached adulthood. This has been the main obstacle she has faced, since it prevented her from studying. She finished primary school and hopes to continue studying for a technical high school degree with a specialty in nursing. She currently lives with her parents, Enrique and Carmen, who are 46 years old, and with her 3-year-old son. Together they live in a rural parish of the city of Quito, capital of the province and of Ecuador. Its name is Gualea, a parish located in the northwest of the province of Pichincha, which was the site of an Ecuadorian culture known as Los Yumbos. This place has great diversity of flora and fauna, as well as rivers and waterfalls from crystalline springs which attract tourists from within and outside the country. Thus, the inhabitants take advantage of the opportunity to offer tours, lodging services, food, and nature activities such as horseback rides, etc. Another means of production in the area is ranching, with the production of milk and meat, as well as agriculture with the production of sugar cane, yuca, corn, oranges, mandarines and papayas. Crafts produced by hand are also a business opportunity in the area; they are in demand due to the unique use of natural materials, such as seeds from the forest. Because of all this, the local authorities have taken care to create appropriate infrastructure so that all of its more than 2000 inhabitants have access to basic utility services. \r\n\r\nJessica has been supported by her parents to cover the necessities for herself and her son. However, having experience in milking cows since she was a girl, she decided to get involved in this business, where she has received help and advice from her parents for the past 2 years. She invests several hours a day in this work, without neglecting the chores of her home and the care of her little son. Now she is requesting a loan so that she can cover the expenses involved in returning to her studies, since she has always dreamed of being a nurse, and she thinks that now is the time to achieve this goal. Jessica is sure that the sale of milk will sustain her in covering the payments for the loan, without neglecting her obligations to her son.

Munah has been involved in the sales of cosmetics since 2008. She says there are fewer purchases during the raining season.

children: Angie and Esmeralda who are 10 and 5 years of age respectively.  She lives in an adobe-based house that she acquired with her husband thanks to much work.  She initially worked doing household chores but she opted for joining her spouse in agricultural work related to growing cocoa beans and organic coffee.  She\u2019s been working for almost 10 years as such and in all this time has acquired much experience related to crop care and maintenance.  She considers her work to be very dedicated because in order to obtain quality harvest she must be diligent about providing the respective care in a strict way constantly getting help from local day workers for the more heavy tasks.\r\n\r\nBeing in the middle of the productive cycle, she finds herself needing to plant plants that will provide temporary shade for the recently grafted plants so that they will have optimum growth and she must also buy supplies like manure and others to guarantee the quality local cooperatives require.\r\n\r\nHer future plans are aimed at building her house with substantial materials for better family well-being hoping to do so as soon as possible by means of her work.

Wilson creci\u00f3 en una familia trabajadora y esforzada, dedicada a la agricultura y otras actividades de la ciudad de Portoviejo. Unidos a\u00fan en las circunstancias dif\u00edciles, y gracias a sus padres, Wilson termin\u00f3 la secundaria. Ahora vive solo y est\u00e1 iniciando los estudios universitarios, los cuales planea terminar derribando cualquier obst\u00e1culo. Tiene una casa que a\u00fan no ha terminado de construir en la cual vive en Los Bancos un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Pichincha, una de las provincias  m\u00e1s grandes en la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Este cant\u00f3n se encuentra a pocos kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de Quito, y tiene diversidad de bosques, adem\u00e1s sus barrios est\u00e1n poblados con gente amable y costumbres propias de esta ciudad en donde tambi\u00e9n se encuentran establecidas varias microempresas administradas por los emprendedores que luchan por hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os cada d\u00eda. Otras de las actividades sobresalientes son la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda, produciendo abundantes cultivos que luego son comercializados para distribuirse hacia muchas provincias. Tambi\u00e9n posee varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como cascadas, r\u00edos, senderos, balnearios en donde el turista es atra\u00eddo por los deportes de aventura que se venden all\u00ed con seguridad garantizada. Wilson forma parte de esta poblaci\u00f3n y ha desarrollado su esp\u00edritu emprendedor tambi\u00e9n pensando en ser un protagonista del crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de su ciudad y del pa\u00eds.\nWilson se independiz\u00f3 de sus padres buscando mejores oportunidades de crecimiento y educaci\u00f3n que en Portoviejo no tuvo la ocasi\u00f3n de encontrar. Tras alg\u00fan tiempo de trabajo en varias actividades ha decidido iniciar sus estudios en la universidad, los cuales se pagan con los ingresos de su trabajo que inici\u00f3 hace 3 a\u00f1os; la crianza de pollos; que emprendi\u00f3 por iniciativa propia al ver la necesidad de autosustentarse diariamente. Invierte en esta actividad hasta 10 horas diarias, dependiendo de una agenda que lleva para el cuidado de los animales, adem\u00e1s los fines de semana sale en medio del ardiente sol o incluso en la lluvia a realizar la venta de los pollos a la feria local. Wilson ha adquirido la suficiente experiencia en esta labor, por lo que ahora necesita que sus ingresos incrementen, lo cual conseguir\u00e1 comprando m\u00e1s pollos para criar y por ende ampliando los criaderos. Wilson espera que con este aumento en sus utilidades pueda pagar sus estudios y tambi\u00e9n realizar a su vivienda los acabados que necesita. Para hacer posible este reto Wilson requiere un pr\u00e9stamo, para lo cual acudi\u00f3 a la sucursal que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa tiene en Los Bancos, en donde encontr\u00f3 mucha agilidad, confianza y apoyo a emprendedores y a personas del sector rural que carecen de oportunidades para contar con capital. Este joven luchador agradece la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva para que varias personas alrededor del mundo formen parte sus sue\u00f1os y crecimiento personal y profesional.","en":"Wilson, 22, is a hardworking young man.  He's single and has no children.  Wilson grew up in a hardworking and strong family dedicated to agriculture and other activities in Portoviejo.  They're close even in difficult circumstances, and Wilson finished secondary school thanks to his parents.  Now he lives alone and is beginning his university studies, which he plans to finish by tackling any obstacle.  \r\n\r\nHe lives in a house that he hasn't finished building in Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pichincha, one of the largest in the Republic of Ecuador.  This canton is located a few kilometers from the city of Quito and has a variety of forests.  Also, its neighborhoods are inhabited by friendly people with traditions typical of this city, where there are also several micro-businesses run by entrepreneurs who strive every day to make their dreams come true.  Other notable activities are agriculture and livestock, which produce abundant crops that are they sold for distribution in many provinces.  There are also a variety of tourist attractions, such as waterfalls, rivers, trails, and hot springs, which attract tourists for adventure sports that are offered there with security guaranteed.\r\n\r\nWilson is part of this community, and he has developed his entrepreneurial spirit while also thinking about being a protagonist in the economic growth of his city and of the country.\r\n\r\nWilson became independent from his parents to look for better opportunities for growth and education that he wasn't able to find in Portoviejo.  After some time working in various jobs he has decided to begin his university studies, paid for with the income from the job he started three years ago, raising chickens.  He set it up on his own initiative when he saw the need to support himself every day.  He invests about 10 hours a day on this activity, depending on his schedule for caring for the animals.  In addition, on the weekend he goes out in full sun or even in the rain to sell chickens in the local street fair.\r\n\r\nWilson has acquired enough experience in the job and now he needs to increase his income, so he's going to buy more chickens to raise and, consequently, expand his poultry farm.\r\n\r\nWilson hopes that with this increase in his profits he'll be able to pay for his studies as well as make the necessary finishing touches to his house.  Wilson needs a loan to make this challenge possible, so he went to the branch of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Los Bancos.  He found a lot of flexibility, trust, and support for entrepreneurs and people in the rural sector who lack opportunities to have capital.\r\n\r\nThis determined young man is grateful for Kiva's participation so that various people around the world will be part of his dreams and his personal and professional growth.

She was born in a very simple farming family with many children.  From a young age she was an independent child and she helped her mother to take care of the household. She has a high school education.  She and her husband have raised two sons who have been a reliable source of support since the grandmother passed away.  By nature, Anarkul is a very lively, kind and honest woman.  \r\n\r\nAnarkul has been involved in animal husbandry since 1996. She and her husband started this business with an initial capital of 15,000 som (KGS) with which they bought some sheep.  Thanks to their hard work and their determination, the farm is now very successful.  Beside animal husbandry, Anarkul is also actively involved in agriculture.  Her family now cultivates more than 6 hectares (14.82 acres) of land on which they sow wheat, potatoes and plants for forage, every year. The family's monthly income amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to increase their headcount of livestock, Anarkul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) with which she will purchase sheep and calves.  With the earnings from the loan that she has received, she is planning to increase her headcount of livestock and, as a result, improve the family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1480.77,"image":{"id":1276406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase more livestock for her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Shapak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-01-17T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-16T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anargul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1057.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":423.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":846.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":211.54,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":10028.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458904,"comment":null},{"amount":211.54,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10028.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495457,"comment":null},{"amount":1057.69,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50143.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426765,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T06:44:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":518260,"name":"Celso","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celso is a 23-year-old resident of Langub, Calamba.

All of the members are from the city of Puerto Montt, Chile. Lorena, seen standing in the second row of the photo in the sixth spot from right to left in front of the window and wearing a black jacket, has made a living in pastry-making for the past 10 years. She says she works at home every day and at the moment is expanding a portion of her home to set up a store. She offers empanadas, artisan confectionery and curantos (a traditional dish from the Chiloe archipelago off the coast of Chile that is prepared in a pit with red-hot stones and seafood is thrown in - clams and mussels being most common - and then covered with leaves and vines). She purchases her supplies from supermarkets and distributors to get what she needs for her pastries and curantos at a low cost, making it economically desirable. With the loan, she plans to purchase more supplies as well as construction materials. One of Lorena's goals is to finish her expansion so she can set up her store and tend to her customers in a more orderly manner. Lorena lives with her husband and their four children, ages 21, 19, 14 and 8. Her dream for her career is to have her own store to generate more profits for her family and to pay for her children's education. She is very content and feels grateful for the opportunity provided by Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza, since it allows her to invest in her business. She says that the training she has received has been essential for her business as well as her personal development, since she has learned to better organize and manage her profits and investments. Puerto Montt is a city in the south of Chile located in the region of Los Lagos. Among the city's attractions are its beautiful green landscapes, its uncrowded beaches, its cuisine - especially its reputation for fish and seafood - and its arts and crafts.

As the main source of income for her family, Adalat has been raising livestock since 1985, having started her business by purchasing a single calf for 300 som (KGS). At the moment, she keeps 4 cows and has 1.3 hectares of arable land, where she annually plants cotton and corn. By breeding and reselling livestock, she earns 15,000-20,000 som (KGS) per month.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Adalat has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to purchase fertilizers, pay salaries to hired help, and purchase livestock. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business by buying additional livestock.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

up in Africa, Angela has distinct memories of helping her parents run their baby clothing store. She never imagined following in her parents' footsteps until she began to notice that her son had very sensitive skin that reacted to regular baby clothing. Researching organic materials, she discovered bamboo, one of the most sustainable and truly \u201cgreen\u201d fabrics. She began making clothing from this miracle fabric and her son\u2019s allergies quickly went away.\r\n\r\nInspired by her son\u2019s recovery, Angela began the journey of starting her own business, Angel Green Baby. Two years later, Angela\u2019s business uses bamboo to make a completely organic baby clothing line.\r\n  \r\nAngela\u2019s business is unique and remarkable because she is creating positive change by using green certified and fair trade vendors as well as organic materials. Angela\u2019s vision to create a healthful product for other children like her son was never limited by her lack of money. In spite of her limited credit history and lack of initial capital to finance her clothing line in bulk, she found opportunities to help her business succeed.  \r\n\r\nA $4,500 loan through Kiva will enable Angela to purchase additional fabric for her clothing line, allowing her to meet the needs of her growing clientele base, while still creating a positive impact on the earth. The loan will also help Angela reach her goal of moving from selling at local farmers' markets to selling her clothing at reputable local baby clothing stores in San Diego.  \r\n\r\nWith your help, Angel Green Baby can continue to make a positive impact on both the community and the globe through sustainable and \u201cgreen\u201d baby clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1580.17,"image":{"id":1277986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The bank is located in a community where the main business activities are growing oranges and sugar cane.\r\n\r\nEsteban belongs to Flor de Campo, is married to Maria del Carmen, and has a young son. Three years ago, he set up a bakery in his house because he knew the profession and believed that having his own business would give him the chance to give his family a better life. At noon, he starts preparing the flour and other ingredients to make the bread dough. This allows the dough time to rise before he shapes it in different forms and puts it in the oven to bake. The process takes all afternoon and is finished in time for him to fill his baskets and go door-to-door selling the bread with friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nA loan from VisionFund will help him buy more supplies such as wood, flour, yeast, and sugar to make bread. He would like to hire two salespeople some day so that he can increase earnings and more people can sample his bread.

Kristine is 40 years old and she is not married. She finished the Kapan Polytechnic Institute and is a metallurgical engineer by profession. Kristine worked in this area for six years, but as the salary was small she decided to start her own business. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Kristine opened her own cafeteria in Kapan. The business is small, but as Kristine says: \"It is profitable and enough for living\". Her parents and friends help her in the business. Kristine has many loyal customers who love to sit and have a good time at Kristine's cafe.

","en":"Kulsun is 54 years old and married. Her youngest daughter Azhar lives with them. In search of a source of income, Kulsun has been engaged in livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 1996. Thanks to Kulsun's persistent work, her farm currently has three heads of cattle, 15 sheep and goats and two horses. In addition to this, Kulsun processes 5.13 hectares of land where she plants potatoes and crops every year.

He has lived and worked in the village of Syunik for around 25 years with his wife, sons and daughter. Before this, Hayk and his family lives in Azerbaijan, but during the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan he was forced to move back to his homeland with his family. At first, it was hard for Hayk to take care of his family. He admitted that it was easier to be in his homeland, of course, but it was not easy to start everything anew and in this difficult time also find work and feed the five children. \n\nWhen Hayk finished agricultural college, he and his wife started working with farming in the village of Syunik. As a result, Hayk's family now has their own piece of land, where they grow grapes, vegetables and fruit. He also built a small greenhouse where he grows parsley, radishes, onions, coriander, dill, basil, rosemary and similar all year round. Hayk used the income to buy a tractor, which was necessary to him, and further he rents out the tractor to his fellow villagers, which also gives him income. \n\nCurrently Hayk and his family are happy and think of themselves as full citizens of their homeland and try to forget the fact that they used to be refugees. For the purchase of seeds, diesel, manure and approval for spring planting, Hayk needs a loan in the amount of 750 US dollars."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1277335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seeds, diesel fuel, manure, and approval for the spring planting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2013-01-17T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-16T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hayk","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":730,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":69},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":72},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":73},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":73},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.49,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":93.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364613364,"comment":null},{"amount":656.51,"local_amount":639,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":656.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373009567,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T22:19:14Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:52:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":518499,"name":"Munhbat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Munhbat is 35 years old and lives with his wife and two children in an apartment in Hovd Province of Mongolia.

Vive con su pareja que trabaja como empleado en una empresa privada y con quien tiene 2 hijos estudiantes. Viven en la Parroquia de Bombol\u00ed, ubicada en Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador con un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Sus varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nAng\u00e9lica lidera el Grupo \u201cCiudad Nueva\u201d, un grupo de 5 personas que se unieron tras el mismo objetivo; buscar apoyo para mejorar y crecer con el negocio que  emprendieron hace algunos a\u00f1os para mejorar su calidad de vida y la de sus familias.\nAng\u00e9lica se dedica a la comercializaci\u00f3n de ropa casual, la cual vende de forma ambulante, recorriendo las largas calles de su ciudad, para visitar a sus clientes y ofrecerles la ropa que tiene en stock y tomando nota de los pedidos que le hacen para que luego ella pueda pedir a su proveedor. Ang\u00e9lica emprendi\u00f3 con esta actividad desde hace algunos a\u00f1os ya que era necesario aportar con los gastos de la casa y de la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, pues como madre luchadora, sue\u00f1a verlos a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales. Debido a la competencia en su negocio, ella ofrece precios bajos y competitivos pero espera obtener este pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en la compra de ropa de temporada al por mayor y as\u00ed cumplir con la demanda de sus clientes que son mujeres, caballeros y ni\u00f1os y as\u00ed poder incrementar sus ingresos que ayudar\u00e1n a mejor la calidad de vida en su hogar. \nSus amigos emprendedores como ella; Darwin, Martha y Francisca se dedican a la crianza de pollos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n y utilizar\u00e1n el pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de pollos y balanceado para su alimentaci\u00f3n. Milton en cambio a sus 23 ya tiene un taller de pintura y necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en compra de pintura, lijas, ti\u00f1er y martillos. Estas personas han detenido el crecimiento en sus negocios debido a la falta de capital y oportunidades de cr\u00e9ditos, ahora para lograr este objetivo acudieron a la sucursal que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa tiene en Santo Domingo y en donde les brindaron agilidad y confianza. Los integrantes de este grupo tienen en com\u00fan el trabajo duro y esforzado que realizan cada d\u00eda y que  sin embargo no ha sido causa para que alguno se d\u00e9 por vencido, pues sus motivaciones personales y familiares les fortalecen para seguir adelante y luchar por sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"Ang\u00e9lica, 28, has gotten ahead despite various obstacles that have arisen in her life.  Despite her wish to become a professional, she was only able to complete secondary school.  She lives with her spouse who works as an employee in a private firm.  She has two children with him who are students.  They live in Bombol\u00ed Parish located in Santo Domingo, capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas Province, a province in Ecuador with a high degree of sustained growth.  Its capital is a city whose greatest attraction is its delicious fruit and the local cuisine.  It has considerable commerce because it\u2019s become a land port of commercial interchange between the country\u2019s coastal and mountain regions.  Thanks to its various tourist attractions and warm climate it\u2019s visited by national and foreign tourists alike.  Because of this, most residents have started commercial or service enterprises for residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica leads the \u201cCiudad Nueva\u201d (New City) group, a group of five people who joined together with the same objective: to find support to improve and grow in businesses they started some years ago in order to improve their and their families\u2019 quality of life.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica works selling casual clothes from place to place.  She wanders the long streets in her city to visit customers offering them the good she has in stock and taking orders for items she can later get from her suppliers.  Ang\u00e9lica started this activity a few years ago because she needed to contribute towards household expenses and help pay for her children\u2019s schooling.  As a dedicated mother, she dreams with seeing her children become professionals.\r\n\r\nDue to competition in her business, she offers low, competitive prices but hopes to get this loan to buy seasonal clothes at wholesale to meet demand from customers who are women, men and children to increase income that will help her improve her home\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nHer friends are entrepreneurs like her.  Darwin, Martha and Francisca raise chickens to then sell and will use the loan to buy chicks and feed for them.  Milton, on the other hand, at the age of 23 already has a paint shop and needs the loan to buy paint, sandpaper, thinner and hammers.  All their businesses have stopped growing due to the lack of capital and loan opportunities.  Now, in order to reach their goals they called on the Santo Domingo branch of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa where they received quick service and trust.\r\n\r\nThe group members have hard work in common and they strive daily and none of them has given up because their personal and family motivations give them strength to continue forward striving towards their dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1278452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She has very good customers, whose business she earns each day with her good treatment of them, her wide smile, and above all, the selection that she always offers.
