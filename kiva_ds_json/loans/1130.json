He has three children and has been doing this work for five years.

An animal on the farm has been given the name of Chebanan.\r\n\r\nCyrus was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: \"Because it offers affordable loans to farmers.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"Importance of directing loans to the intended projects.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit his family?\" Cyrus replied, \"Income from the poultry project will help me educate my children and expand my hotel business.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Cyrus owns the following: cow, poultry and bicycle, but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, electricity, a TV and DVD, but does not have solar power, running water or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo

She has 5 children, but only lives with 2 of them: Yurica and Liz whom she has been taking care of in her mother's house for 13 years. Her mother has been traveling abroad for many years and that is where she lives now, as she had to be in charge of the family property.\r\n\r\nDue to her 7 plots, she can grow corn, potatoes, and beans in large quantities. She takes very good care of them as it is one of the best in the area.

She already has several chickens, 40 guinea pigs and 10 rabbits, which bring her extra income.

Her husband\u2019s Cambodian-American background gave them both a love for Southeast Asian food, in particular pho, or Vietnamese rice noodles. Their shared passion for food instilled in them a desire to provide quality service and experience, while contributing more to the community.  \r\n\r\nAlthough both Cindy and her husband loved the idea of opening a food truck, they decided to start small and opened a food tent instead.  Just last week, Cindy and her husband launched their food tent, Pho Realz. With this business, they can set up shop at local farmers\u2019 markets and share their love for pho.\r\n\r\nIn opening their own business, Cindy and her husband have faced some financial challenges, including finding the capital to start. Furthermore, she shared that their biggest struggle is getting the word out about their unique, local food tent. However, she enjoys the challenge and is committed to the long-term success of her business.\r\n\r\nCindy finds value and passion in partnering with the local community and giving back. She has already worked with a local artist to design their logo, and has a deep appreciation for a locally oriented, hospitable mindset. She hopes for the future that her business can continue to share a love of culture and give back to the community.\r\n\r\nWith your help, Cindy and her husband can pay for a vehicle to transport their food and tent supplies; also equipment and start-up food and licensing costs. Your contributions will directly enable Cindy and her husband to provide quality food at local farmers\u2019 markets.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1042.12,"image":{"id":1359203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nHelena dreams to expand her business and hopes that her children will have a good life. She meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Kanibadam. She was born and grew up in a rural area. She is a young single mother. She got married early; after her son was born, her husband left the family and never came back. By now he has a new family and other children. Poor Ummatoy  was left to raise her child alone. She returned to her parents, but that was hard on her as well. Yet one has to go on living, if just for the sake of the child; dreams of a happy family strengthened Ummatoy and gave her hope. At first she started working at the local collective farm, and worked the land from morning till night, sparing no effort. She was able to save some money and buy a dairy cow. She has been fattening this cow for a while; now her cow has gained weight and brings in over 10 liters of milk per day. Ummatoy sells the milk and buys items of first necessity for herself and her little son.\r\n\r\nOn her girlfriends\u2019 advice, she reached out to Arvand for help. She would like to get more cattle. She needs funds for this, but does not have enough cash. Ummatoy plans to use her loan to buy cattle. She really hopes   to save enough money in order to buy an apartment and live separately from her parents. She thanks Arvand in advance for its support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":788.15,"image":{"id":1351719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy  cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-26T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-25T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ummatoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":482.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":498.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":515.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":551.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":569.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":589.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":609.21},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":629.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":651.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":673.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":696.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.65,"local_amount":482.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":483.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752032,"comment":null},{"amount":105.1,"local_amount":498.76,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":499.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616119,"comment":null},{"amount":108.66,"local_amount":515.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":516.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859989,"comment":null},{"amount":112.34,"local_amount":533.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":534.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136733,"comment":null},{"amount":116.15,"local_amount":551.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":552.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900928,"comment":null},{"amount":120.09,"local_amount":569.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":571.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550112,"comment":null},{"amount":124.16,"local_amount":589.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":590.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774337,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-30T09:49:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":564784,"name":"Luis Gerardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis es un hombre de 36 a\u00f1os, es soltero, vive en la ciudad de Caman\u00e1, el es una persona muy amable, trabajador y entusiasta, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por salir adelante;

For many days his rickshaw has not been working properly, and because of that, he is unable to generate any income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Razia, as a member of a two-person group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

He lives with his family which is made up of his wife and two children who collaborate in the sowing of the corn. They are a very united family. He is a very well-known person in the area, very friendly and respectful with the people who live around him. He is very hard-working. He also makes a living buying and selling animals, which he learned to do when he was young and his father taught him the work, and which he has continued to do up until today.\r\n\r\nHe buys his supplies in the nearest town, which is four kilometers from his house. In order to be able to buy supplies and food for his household, he also goes to a farmhouse nearby and buys animals that he will be able to sell. The transfer of supplies and animals is very difficult since it requires them to walk 8 kilometers. They must travel both-ways to be able to arrive at their destination.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will help him to buy agricultural supplies to begin to sow corn, since the sowing season is coming up and he has 35 square meters of land to work with, and to maintain his animals in order to sell them.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be very helpful to cover his needs because he does not have enough money to begin the harvest and the sowing period is approaching.

His family is comprised of four members, including his wife and children. His wife looks after the home and the older children work.

In addition to that, he farms, has several cows, and also grows corn.\r\n\r\nHe is a person of good character, responsible, friendly with the neighbors, and is a member of the area's church. He buys agricultural supplies in the nearest village, where he buys the majority of things that he uses for his work.\r\n\r\nHe also buys some things in the city, 20 km away,  that he can't find in the village. To travel from his home to the city, he has the challenge of transportation, as he has to spend money for transportation if it exists, as it is very scarce. If he doesn't find it he has to walk that distance to the village. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to pay for the rent on the land where he will grow corn and sorghum, and to purchase the manure for his corn crop, and insecticides for pest control. He considers that the loan he is applying for will help him get better income at harvest time.  It will also help him buy cows so that he can obtain a quantity of milk for daily use in his home, and this way the loan will improve the quality of life for him and for his family. \r\n\r\nHe plans to set up a store in his home with basic household products, as another source of income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50.53,"image":{"id":1359800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay the rent on the land where he will grow corn and sorghum and to buy fertilizer for his corn, and insecticides for pest control.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":211,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":211}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.53,"local_amount":47.39,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857023,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-28T01:05:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565195,"name":"Jessica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jessica, de 29 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer trabajadora y empe\u00f1osa, con muchas ganas de progresar, es madre soltera y vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su hijo de 08 a\u00f1os de edad en su casa propia.Jessica se dedica a vender productos comestibles por eso cuenta con una tienda que est\u00e1 instalada en su hogar, desde alli atiende a sus clientes, que en la mayor\u00eda son sus propios vecinos.Le  gusta su trabajo pues le permite estar en la comodidad de su hogar y atender a su hijo sin problemas.Este ser\u00e1 el segundo pr\u00e9stamo con Kiva, Por ello espera de su colaboraci\u00f3n para que pueda concretar sus planes.Con el monto solicitado de 600 nuevos soles comprar\u00e1 productos comestibles tales como arroz, leche , conservas de pescado , entre otros .\n","en":"Jessica is 29 years old and is a very hardworking and enterprising woman with a great desire to get ahead.

is 28 years old. He lives in the small village of Bolnisi District with his wife, sister and parents. Ekhtiram requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from their agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of land, where potatoes and haricot are grown. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEkhtiram requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ekhtiram has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

He lives in the small village of Bolnisi District with his wife, parents, and aunt. Ramin\u2019s parents and aunt are provided with a retirement pension. He requested a loan from the local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of land, where cucumbers and tomatoes are grown. They sell the harvested products at local markets. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRamin requested loan from Credo to start a family business. Ramin has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

The start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Vasil will open a car washing center in his garden. He will purchase all the needed equipment and start washing cars. As Vasil is a very hard working man, he will try his best and work hard to make his business successful and profitable. The increased income will help Vasil and his family to improve their living conditions and have better life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1359448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To open a car washing center.

Lom Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a five-member group and they called themselves \u201cJonlhing Lom\u201d group. They live in the northeastern part of India in the state of Manipur.  Jonlhing, according to the Kuki folk tale, was a very beautiful girl. Her beauty spread far and wide and people from different and far off places came to \r\nsee and admire her beauty. Her beauty was compared with the brightness of the sun and she was adored by all. Speaking of which, the group members truly represent the beauty and personality of \u201cJonlhing\u201d in their work because they work tirelessly and continually, hoping to bring change to \r\ntheir life and the lives of many people around them. \r\n\r\nThe profiled member is Neilhing who is on the extreme left of the picture with her right hand raised. She is 32 years of age and blessed with two sons and two daughters. They are a happy family and her husband has his own local electronics repair workshop in the village. He repairs all kinds of electronic gadgets in the village like cell phones, radios, TVs and tape recorders. But the money that he receives from the workshop is not enough to run the house and pay for the children's monthly school fees. So, Neilhing decided to open a tailoring shop in the village where she knits trousers, shirts and school uniforms. But still, this job is not enough to meet the expenses of the family, because she is able to get only a meager income from the tailoring shop. \r\n\r\nShe said that with the loan from KIVA, she will be able to buy more fabric for garments so that she can knit more and sell more. She also said that in this way, she can take more orders in advance and doesn\u2019t have to wait for the customers to go to the nearest town to get the fabric. This is also going to save a lot of time and money for the villagers and at the same time, people from the nearby villages will come to get the garments from her. In this way, she will earn more and save more for her family. \r\n\r\nShe said that over the next 10 years, she wishes to buy a paddy field of her own where she can grow wheat, grain and some cash crops in the field. Not only that, she wishes to continue knitting and expand her tailoring shop. The other group members are engaged in many other income-\r\ngenerating activities like raising piglets for sale, and opening shops in different location within the village.\r\n\r\nShe thanks KIVA for offering loans. The group members said that God has answered their prayers and for that reason, they all can fulfill what they had been dreaming of. They also thank WSDS for their endless support, and hope that KIVA and WSDS will continue to render their support in the years to come."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1354958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy more fabric to make garments to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T06:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T06:50:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kimnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinkhovei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T15:16:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":564976,"name":"Lelibeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lelibeth runs a sari-sari or variety store business selling various goods and items to the people in her place in Ubay, Bohol.

Kou said only one of her children is in school, and they all live in the same house which was built by the children's father. \r\nWith a little money from her husband, Kou was able to establish her tabletop business ten years ago, where she sells palm oil, salt, pepper etc. Kou spends 8 hours at her business per day, from Monday to Saturday. One problem she faces is a small income. Kou is requesting a loan to purchase more inventory for her business. Her plan is to one day build a modern house.

is a 49-year-old married woman and an enterprising woman with many dreams to fulfill. She lives in the area of Rawalpindi, Pakistan. She has been in the business of selling clothes for almost 4 years. She purchases clothes from different areas and sells them in the main market for a profitable amount. \r\n\r\nSajida is a responsible mother of three children. Her husband makes his living as a daily worker whose income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family members. She faced many problems in her early married life; there were days when her children often slept without having any food. But now her contribution to the family income is playing a vital role in fulfilling the needs of the family members. \r\n\r\nTo cope with the increasing demand during the summer season, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a variety of clothing in different colors. She hopes to get an increase in her net income and wishes to spend part of the profits on the improvement of her house. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 3 milking cows whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides, they have a plot of agricultural land where 400 nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested nuts at local markets at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGuram requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Guram will open an auto repair workshop. After the workshop is opened, Guram will repair cars and increase the income of his family.

They belong to a poor family and his income is inadequate to run the household. \r\n\r\nAs a member of a three-person lending group, Amtul has requested a loan from Kiva's partner Brac Pakistan. The loan will help her husband to purchase rexine (leathercloth) and canvas sheets to make bags to sell. As they have no other source of income, with the help of this loan, her husband will be able to grow his business. \r\n\r\nAmtul dreams of the higher education of her children.

Nemneilhing is raising chickens now along with her husband! She belongs to <i>Sahei<\/i> JLG Group and she represents the featured borrower for the group. She is pictured with her hand raised. Poultry is a family business for Nemneilhing\u2019s in-laws. Her in-laws have now handed over the responsibility for raising chickens to Nemneilhing, and she is working hard to make more profits than before.\r\n\r\nNemneilhing and her husband both work side by side to make their chicken poultry farm a flourishing and successful one. She feeds them and also takes care of them. Since the family\u2019s main source of income is through selling the chickens, Nemneilhing also learns all the possible tips for raising chickens. She is very interested and hopeful that she will do great. The challenging parts, she says, are that the feeds are bought from the market, which is costly, and when the poultry is infected with contagious diseases. The loss is huge because the village is far from the city, and veterinary doctors can\u2019t reach them easily. The chickens are sold for profit when they are fully grown. They are sold in the village and in the neighbouring villages as well. Her husband usually takes the chickens to the town market too.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, she will purchase 100 more chickens. She says the income from the poultry business is the only source of income for the family, and it is not sufficient to manage the household expenses and run the business. She is glad that Kiva and WSDS are providing financial aid to help her raise more chickens and make more profit.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members have a piggery and vegetable selling business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1358557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase 100 more chicks to raise and sell for profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neihoithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heshing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimnunmoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhinghoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-28T04:33:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565052,"name":"Tamaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tamaz is 32 years old. He lives in the small village of Terjola District with his wife, son, parents, brother, daughter-in-law and two cousins. Tamaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 milk cows and 4 calves, whose milk is used in cheese products. Besides that, they have a vineyard with 450 grapevines and a 0.9 hectare plot of land where different kinds of vegetables are grown. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTamaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan Tamaz will purchase a minibus. After the minibus is purchased, he will get orders to transport cargo and can generate income.  This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Ramaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. Besides, they have a vineyard with 400 grapevines and a hectare plot of land where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the harvested products and cheese locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Ramaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Ramaz will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built, they will grow tomatoes and greens there. They will sell the harvested tomatoes and greens at local markets. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is a 36-year-old energetic lady. She has three children. Her husband is a laborer, and his income is not enough to meet his family\u2019s needs. In order to overcome the financial problems, Uzma decided to help out her husband by doing an animal sales business, and then she requested a loan from Kashf Foundation to provide full support to her family. She is obtaining her fourth loan with Kashf Foundation and strongly believes that she has improved her living standard and that her children are receiving a good education due to good income sources.

He lives in Kutaisi District, West Georgia, with his wife and two sons (5 and 6 years old). Levan applied for loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan applications were always rejected, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Levan is works as a security provider at the local bank. His wife is a seller in the local shop. They both receive small monthly salaries. Levan applied for loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Levan will purchase play equipment for children.

It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMariam requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Mariam has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this credit, Mariam will purchase a special apparatus for cleaning the face. As she is a cosmetologist, she plans to work at a local beauty salon as she will purchase the needed equipment. She thinks that business will be profitable as the beauty salon is very popular in Kutaisi.

Thanks to her efforts and sacrifice on the part of her parents, she was able to get a rudimentary education, but she was not able to continue due to a lack of financial resources.  \r\n\r\nNorma has a lot of experience working in agriculture, because her parents taught her to work the land from the time that she was very young.   She learned through family tradition how to grow coffee.  The land that she and her partner cultivate is their own, thanks to an inheritance from their parents.  The land is located 300 meters from the house where they live.  Norma walks there each day along with her partner and children to care for and maintain her coffee crops.\r\n\r\nNorma is now requesting help to buy organic and chemical fertilizers to maintain her crops, since with this support she will be able to protect her coffee plants.  With these supplies they will be more resistant to pests and other threats.\r\n\r\nNorma's dream is to continue improving her crops so that she can increase the size, variety and quality of her harvests. She says that her children are her greatest priority \u2013 especially their studies \u2013 but also all of the other things that come up daily that her family needs or that can improve their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1359899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic and chemical fertilizers to maintain her coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":23000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-27T20:54:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565285,"name":"Nehemias Gamaliel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nehemias tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, esta acompa\u00f1ado y tiene un hijo.

is 47 year-old Rugiatu. She is married and has two children aged 16 and 13 years. In 1996, Rugiatu established her empty five gallon rubber containers business. She began her business to support her child's education. Her business is located in city centre and her main customers are both men and women. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL1,000,000 every month from her business.

was born in 1957 at Nyamabare, Kebisoni, Rukungiri District. She is married with five children, two of whom attend school. Mabel is a cattle farmer and carries out cattle fattening at Nyamabare \u2013 Kebisoni. This is her major source of income. She collects money from her farm milk and cow sales and with this income, she started constructing a house at her residence.

Now she is selling cakes, enchiladas, candies, popsicles, chicken sandwiches, and soft drinks at the snack stand of a school. She wants to increase the variety of products even more, offering products like \"pupusas\" (thick corn tortillas stuffed with beans, cheese or meat). Her family provides her with some things that she needs for her business, but others she needs to purchase from a village four kilometres away, and transport is hard to come by.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy supplies to make different food items and improve the infrastructure of her stand, since things get wet when it rains. By buying more merchandise, she will avoid having to travel so often to the village and will thereby save time and money. Her desires are to send her children to school and that they finish university. She also hopes to expand her stand and grow it into a large store with basic products so that her customers don't have to travel so far.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":243.9,"image":{"id":1359941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He needs additional capital for the growth of his business, as his demand from clients is increasing day by day. Therefore his wife Sonia has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband's store. He will purchase a variety of products including flour, milk packs, eggs, pulses, detergents, oils, etc. to keep up with the increased demand of clients. Sonia and her husband are very hopeful that the loan will be a lucky and productive one for their family. The second woman in the photo is shabana and she wants loan for her husband's vegetable shop. Her husband would purchase fresh vegetables and renovate his shop. This would increase their net income and savings. \n\nNOTE: In the picture Sonia is raising her

is a milk seller by profession. He sells milk in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. He is the only earning person in the family. He wants to provide quality education to his children, and to do that he has to save a huge amount of money. But daily expenses are increasing every day and his income is insufficient even to sustain his family life. He is facing a load shedding problem in his area as well and because of that he can't preserve milk in the freezer. \r\n\r\nPresently he needs to purchase food for buffaloes.

For the past two years she has been selling palm oil in the local market. She started this business with money given to her by her husband. She enjoys her business, because the business gives her more money.  She sells six days a week, from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Most of the time, she uses a shared taxi to get her goods to her shop.

The group's members chose the name for the group themselves because there are coral trees growing in their local area.  Enedina represents the group and she tells us that she is 29 years old, has been married for a year - to a man named Romualdo -, and together with her husband they have a two children - one is already at primary school.  Enedina has had a grocery store for ten years.  The idea was Enedina's and it all started with her husband selling sweets from a wooden table but, little by little, they started selling groceries.  Now, Enedina is applying for a loan in order to buy more groceries such as detergent, milk, eggs, sugar, salt, seeds, tinned goods, drinks and bread, which is what usually sells most in the community.  According to Enedina, she has not had any difficulties with her grocery store but she says her dream is to expand the business and to begin selling cold meats and dairy products, such as yoghurts, again.  That way she will earn more and can improve her children's quality of life so that they can study to be professionals.  Enedina and, indeed, the whole group, are very happy and grateful to the institution as, thanks to the loan, they will be able to invest in their businesses.  Catalina, Juana, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Julia and Olivia will invest in raising yearling sheep.  Gregoria will invest in raising pigs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":1346349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic and has a strong desire to move ahead in life.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and due to the fact that she had to work from a very young age, Llajaira was unable to study nursing as she had wanted.  In her spare time she likes to play sports and sometimes she will prepare a tasty \"aj\u00ed de gallina\" (a traditional, chicken-based, Peruvian dish) to share with her family.\r\n\r\nThrough her own initiative and with a lot of determination and dedication, Llajaira works with her business selling clothes.  She sells clothing items for men, women and children.

The members of the group have businesses sewing accessories, and selling diverse goods, including vegetables, ceramic and plastic bowls, provisions, cooked rice and beans, and second-hand clothing. With a view to increasing their capital, the group members decided to approach ID-Ghana for a loan.\r\n\r\nEvans (the only male group member, standing on the right) is a clothing seller. He is planning to use his part of the loan to buy one bale of clothing from the market, which he will resell to customers.  With this loan he hopes to make an average monthly profit of GHS 100 and, as is the case for other members in the group, this profit will be used to reinvest in the business. \r\n\r\nThe group members

and young son, who he loves and who are his main reasons for life.  He is a friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic person who dedicates all of his efforts to getting his family ahead.  Unfortunately he had to go to work at an early age to help his parents, due to lack of financial resources and he was not able to study for the professional mechanical engineering career he desired.  He likes to read newspapers in his spare time and at times cooks a delicious carapulca with dried soup to share with his family.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative and with great dedication and effort, Wilber works as a taxi driver, providing transportation  services in the city.

The area is one of the most populated areas in Montserrado County with one of the best standards of living in the country:  good roads, access to clean water, affordable rents and plentiful transportation options. \r\n\r\nRebecca is single with two children aged 13 and 8. Her children are currently attending school and are living with her at home. She runs a shop selling charcoal.  She describes herself as a serious businesswoman. She started her business six years ago, using money given to her by her fiancee.  Typically, she works 7am to 4pm from Monday to Saturday at her business and transports her goods to her business by bus.  She cites her greatest challenge as small income.  She is proud of her business because it allows her to support her children.\r\n\r\nUsing the proceeds of this loan, she intends to purchase more charcoal.  In the future, she plans to build her house and educate her children.  She sincerely thanks you in advance for your support.

The city has a sizable population of Dominicans and Haitian immigrants who live in communities with very limited resources.\r\n\r\nInes is very excited to receive her fourth loan from Esperanza International, having satisfactorily repaid her previous loan and taken an important step in her business's growth. She has had her business for about six years. She started it with her own capital, after she saved money by doing different jobs. She is running a shoes sales business, and she is planning on investing the new loan in buying many dozens of tennis shoes, sandals, sneakers and casual shoes for women, kids and men. She sells the shoes by walking around, from her house, and from a place in a flea market once a week.\r\n\r\nInes\u2019s family is made up of herself and her two children. She tells us that her greatest challenge is to have her own house. She really enjoys working and taking care of her children. She will use her profits to invest in her business and to start saving, this time to make possible one of her dreams, to have her own house.
