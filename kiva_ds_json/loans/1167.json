That's why he entered a second cycle loan with Kiva's partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy a large quantity of glass at good prices to improve his business. This loan will surely decrease part of his indirect business expenses, because he won't limit his work to specialized glass work, and the earnings for his services will increase.

","en":"Umarali is a young, married, 27 year-old man.  He has a wife and two small children, together with whom he lives in the city of Kulob.  Umarali does not have a higher education.  He started working as a driver right after finishing school, at the age of 19 years old.  Currently, he provides a taxi service along the Kulob-Dushanbe route.

Tolobek and his family have been running their own business since 1993.  A cow was purchased first.  Today, he has two dairy cows and one horse on his farm.  Tolobek's wife acitvely helps to run the business.  Thanks to Tolobek's hard work and patience, his family's monthly profit amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).  His oldest daughter works and helps the family financially.  The younger children help with the household.  In order to further develop his business, Tolobek requested a loan in the amount of 75,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners.\"  He requested this loan together with a group, consisting of three people (one man and two women).  The group is called \"Lenin.\"  Tolobek plans to use the earnings from the loan to further increase livestock headcount on his farm.  In the future, he wants to improve his family's

Umeda wants to build a shed to store her wheat and potato crops, but she does not have enough money to buy building materials. Because it is humid in northern Tajikistan, she needs to store the crops in a dry place before selling them. She has asked for a loan of $1,000 in order to buy brick and slate.

In the summer the price of corn increases and this loan will allow her to maintain her sales and to avoid losing clients. \r\nThrough having working capital, Evelyn will be able to always keep her customers in good supply, and she will always have all the necessary equipment for making tamales.

However, he says that at the time, the need that his neighbors had to access drinking water was so great that he was motivated to lend them a hand. He decided to take a risk and opened his water supply business. He began expanding his facilities to his closest neighbors. He put in a water outlet at the corner of his house where horse-drawn carts approached with drums to transport the vital liquid to the most distant regions.\r\n\r\nBy taking out a mortgage loan, Celso expanded his facilities little by little to be able to provide drinking water to more people. At the same time, his business grew and today he has 1292 users, all registered y controlled by high-quality meters. Today his water supply facility is equipped with 6 artesian wells - each with a depth of 145 meters, an underground water tank with a capacity of 106,000 liters that functions as a reserve and three 35,000-liter tanks that supply the community on a daily basis.

She decided to start this work because she has always liked to cook and, especially, make desserts.  Her taste for this activity came from her need to make healthy food for her children.  Then she thought selling desserts and making pastry would be a good way to earn her own money.\n\nLittle by little she has attracted good customers.  She sells door-to-door and on order.  One day she goes out to offer her products and the next day she makes the pastries to deliver.  She also makes sandwiches for parties.  Lupe says she has more sales in the cold weather, but she's always looking for ways to keep her sales stable.  In the hot weather gelatin sells very well.\n\nWhat she likes most about her job in addition to earning her own money is that making pastry reflects the best of what she is, and she puts a lot of love and effort into each sandwich or pastry she makes.\n\nA loan from Kiva and VisionFund will help her buy flour, sugar, eggs, gelatin, disposable supplies, Chantilly cream, powdered sugar, and

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya.

This left Trans-Nzoia one of Kenya\u2019s most cosmopolitan areas, with individuals from a variety of linguistic and ethnic groups living in close proximity. The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflowers, sugar cane, millet, and beans.

Its proximity to the dense Mount Elgon forest, as well as other neighboring forests, makes it a high-potential beekeeping region. \r\n\r\nSamuel is married, and has five children. His wife works as a shopkeeper, while he tends to their farm. He has been farming for twelve years, and is currently growing sugarcane and maize crops.

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCorazon operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nCorazon dreams to expand her business and hopes that her children will finish their schooling.

Her oldest son is married and now works abroad. His wife has recently learned to sew and now wants to apply her skills in business. Ashiroy wants to help her daughter-in-law to open her own business and that's why she came for a loan to buy an electronic sewing machine by the make of Yamata. Her daughter-in-law plans to make two dresses a day. She can sew a simple dress and a dress with beautiful embroidery which costs more.

La producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados abastece la distribuci\u00f3n interna y el excedente se env\u00eda a la Regi\u00f3n Costa en productos ya procesados. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nUno de los alimentos t\u00edpicos de esta ciudad son los \u201chelados de salcedo\u201d productos que guardan una gran historia y tienen m\u00e1s de 60 a\u00f1os en el mercado, su receta fue descubierta en los interiores de un convento por una de las madres franciscanas  quienes anhelaban mejores d\u00edas para la comunidad, es por esto que inicialmente este producto ten\u00eda el nombre inicial de \u201cHelado de las Monjas\u201d que era comercializado solamente en el interior del convento pero la demanda era tan alta que luego los vend\u00edan de forma ambulante generando as\u00ed trabajo para varias personas del pueblo. Finalmente varias familias tuvieron acceso a la f\u00f3rmula que ahora los hace famosos en todo el pa\u00eds e incluso internacionalmente, pues son exportados alrededor de 80.000 unidades cada a\u00f1o a varios pa\u00edses. \nBel\u00e9n nos cuenta esta historia de memoria pues trabaj\u00f3 en un sitio de venta de helados de salcedo y hace un a\u00f1o emprendi\u00f3 con su propio local de helados en donde vende tambi\u00e9n v\u00edveres y golosinas, es de gran ayuda para ella que su local est\u00e9 ubicado en un lugar estrat\u00e9gico en el centro de la ciudad en donde pasean varios turistas. Invierte 5 horas cada d\u00eda a la atenci\u00f3n de su local, pues varias horas tambi\u00e9n debe asistir a la universidad y cumplir tareas. Ahora est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en varias mejoras y arreglos a su vivienda que est\u00e1 deteriorada y adem\u00e1s con muchos trabajos pendientes que le causan molestias a diario. Aunque Bel\u00e9n no ha tenido la oportunidad de asistir a las capacitaciones que ofrece Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, ella ha encontrado en esta IMF el apoyo y asesor\u00eda necesarios para dar paso firme a su crecimiento. Ella considera muy importante el apoyo que varios microempresarios y emprendedores reciben de todo el mundo a trav\u00e9s de Kiva y se siente muy motivada para seguir y cumplir sus obligaciones pues as\u00ed no solo ella sino tambi\u00e9n su pa\u00eds presentar\u00e1n una excelente imagen ante el mundo.","en":"Bel\u00e9n is a 21-year-old young woman. She is single and works very hard in order to pay for her university studies. Bel\u00e9n's dream is to become a professional businesswoman. She lived in a city that was devastated by volcanic eruptions. As a result, the local economy has suffered from a drop in tourism. That is why Bel\u00e9n decided to move to the canton of Salcedo, where she currently lives. Salcedo is located in the Oriente de Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces in the mountain region of Ecuador. \r\n\r\nIn Salcedo, there are many tourist attractions such as lakes, hot springs, and extreme sports for adventure tourists. However, the principal economic activity in this town is agriculture and (to a smaller extent) livestock. The most abundant crops include peas, beans, lentils, and other fruits and vegetables. Milk and dairy products are also produced for local markets and the excess processed items are sent to the coastal region. This is a good region for raising livestock due to the favorable climate the canton enjoys. Despite this productivity, there are some very concerning illiteracy and poverty rates. Many basic needs are not met. For example, the sewage system only reaches 25% of homes in the area. \r\n\r\nOne of the typical foods of the city are the \"Salcedo ice creams\", products that have a great history and have been sold for over 60 years. The recipe was discovered in the convent of some Franciscan nuns who desired better days for the community. For this reason, the first name for the dessert was \"the nuns' ice cream\" and was sold only from the convent. However, demand grew so high that they began to sell the ice cream in the streets, which created jobs for the people of the town. Finally, various families learned the now famous recipe, which is recognized throughout the country and internationally. Each year, about 80,000 units are exported to various countries.\r\n\r\nBel\u00e9n knows the history by heart because she worked at a site that sells the Salcedo ice cream. A year ago, she opened her own ice cream shop from which she also sells groceries and sweets. This is a great help to her because her store is located in a strategic place in the center of the city where many tourists pass by. Bel\u00e9n works five hours each day at her store because she also attends classes and has homework from the university.\r\n\r\nBel\u00e9n is requesting a loan to do some repairs on her home, which is deteriorating and is a daily nuisance. Although Bel\u00e9n has not had the opportunity to attend the trainings that Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa offers, she enjoys the support and advice this institution provides to help her grow. She thinks the support Kiva offers to small businesses and business owners all over the world is very important. She is motivated to fulfill all of her obligations because, in this way, not only she but also her country will make a good impression on the world.

Today she has a small farm with two dairy cows, two calves and 15 head of sheep and goats.  She also has .90 hectares of land, where she plants potatoes and beans.  With the goal of increasing her business, Kuljamila has turned to the Bai-Tushum Microfinance Bank for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy calves.

Kristina and was born in Sejiram, Kapuas Hulu, West Kalimantan, on July 7, 1996. She was the first child and has four brothers. Her father and her mother work as an elementary school teacher in the village. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to become an expert in shipping and transportation management. Because Indonesia is an archipelagic nation, certainly there are a lot of jobs in the field of shipping and transportation management.\r\n\r\nKristina recently graduated from high school. She wants to continue her studies at the Academy of Maritime Nusantara Cilacap, Department of KPN. Kristina chose AMN for two reasons, first because her parents cannot afford tuition for Kristina, and second, as an expert in shipping and transportation management, she will be able to quickly get a job in Indonesia or a foreign company. So Kristina can achieve her goals without  burdening her parents and can provide greater opportunities for her younger siblings to attend school.\r\n\r\nTo be able to achieve her goals, Kristina is willing to go far from her parents and younger siblings to attend school on the island of Java. Kristina chose AMN college in Cilacap, because Kristina got information from her uncle who works in YSBS that in Cilacap there is the AMN Student Loan program for students from poor families. This program gave her great hope and Kristina is very excited because then she can go to college and later can achieve her goals. Kristina said, \"But the excitement and hope is still dependent on the kindness of all of you, and depends on your generosity to lend me money for school fees. Please help me. I promise to return the loan later when I've graduated and am working. For your generosity, I say thank you. \"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1388410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay education fees for three years.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"CILACAP","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":253,"posted_date":"2013-07-16T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-15T15:00:03Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kristiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T14:46:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":583199,"name":"Latifan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Latifan is a 42-year-old married woman.

She has a high school education and has been growing crops and raising farm animals since 1997, when she started a business with 5,000 somoni. Despite the loss of her husband, who was the family's breadwinner, Atyrkul found the strength in herself to keep the farm going. Today she is a successful farmer with three milk cows, one horse, and 20 head of sheep and goats. She also has 1.2 hectares of land to grow potatoes and beans.
