That is why, in spite of the fact that her business is only two years old, her customer base has grown significantly.

Owing to the numerous family parties that take place over the Christmas and New Year period, households consume a lot more than normal and Rosal\u00edo's working capital is not high enough to respond to the demand he experiences.  For this reason, he is applying for a Kiva loan (his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  He will buy rice, oil and other food products so that he will experience very good sales over the Christmas and New Year period.  He also hopes to make very good profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1267018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, oil and other food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T09:16:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T09:16:21Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73646},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82209},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84127},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86090},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88099},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90154},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92258},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94411},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96614},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":98868},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":101175},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":112349}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.8},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.84,"local_amount":73646,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":74397.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071709,"comment":null},{"amount":46.71,"local_amount":82209,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83048.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497922,"comment":null},{"amount":47.8,"local_amount":84127,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84985.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527737,"comment":null},{"amount":48.92,"local_amount":86090,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":86968.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928485,"comment":null},{"amount":50.05,"local_amount":88099,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":88998.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705639,"comment":null},{"amount":51.23,"local_amount":90154,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":91074.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967927,"comment":null},{"amount":52.42,"local_amount":92258,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-26T08:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":93199.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817125,"comment":null},{"amount":53.64,"local_amount":94411,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":95374.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323401,"comment":null},{"amount":232.39,"local_amount":409006,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":413181.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082648,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T14:36:22Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512845,"name":"Aref","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aref is a 37-year-old married man.

It was formed in 2010 and consists of five members. These hard working women belong to the Meitei community. They live in a small village on the outskirts of Imphal East located in the state of Manipur in the Northeastern part of India.\r\n\r\nMemcha is the profile member pictured with her hand raised. She is 31 years old and is a mother to two sons and a daughter. She lives with her children and husband who is a carpenter by profession but usually earns income for the family on a seasonal basis. All the children attended a private school nearby. Before taking a loan, she did weaving activities part-time. At the same time, she did sand sieving activities from time to time. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, with her first loan, she opened a small shop to earn income. She sells paan, cigarettes, soap, toy guns and eatables. With the second loan the following year, she expanded her shop by bringing in more new items to sell. With the help of her husband, she also started to sell fresh vegetables and included more grocery items such as oil, spices locally found, grain, potatoes, sugar, milk powder, chili, dry fish, dal etc. With the profit, she managed to repay her loan liability. She contributed INR 100 to the group savings on a monthly basis. Moreover, in order to save more, she joined a group of investors managed locally and invested INR 500 monthly. With the delay in loan disbursement by WSDS for the third phase, she used these savings to continue her business. She and her husband plan to re-establish her husband's carpentry business. She has been working very hard to sustain the family and providing education to her children is her only goal.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to continue with her supplementary income activities.

They live in a small village at the outskirts of Imphal East in the state of Manipur which is in the North Eastern part of India. In order to supplement their family incomes, they came together as a group to help one another to access loans.\r\n\r\nPasot is the profiled member and is pictured with raised hand. She is 36 years old, a mother to three children, and lives with her husband, who is a workshop mechanic for two-wheeler vehicles. All her children go to a private school at the nearby town. She is very happy and determined to provide a good learning platform for her children. Before her loan she was a mere housewife. She just had to be content with the income that her husband brought home. With much persuasion, she talked her husband into letting her join a 5-member group to access loans.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she partnered with one weaver for profit-sharing. She bought yarns for the weaver to weave. Then she would sell the woven traditional clothes at the main market. With her second loan she continued with the trade on a wider scale by purchasing finished products to increase her supply at the main market. With part of her loan she opened a small tea stall which was open in the morning till 9:00 am and in the afternoon from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm, for her convenience. In her tea stall she serves only tea and 'puri'. As it turns out, she has been making better progress with her tea stall business than her other business. Eventually she began opening her tea stall for longer periods and it became her main source of income as well as for the family because her husband began helping at the tea stall. It has been quite some time now that her husband quit the mechanic work and engaged in the tea stall\/catering business.\r\n\r\nNow Pasot needs another loan to continue with her tea stall. She wishes to upgrade her tea stall with better arrangements for the customers to sit down. She also wishes to find a replacement for her husband. She means that her husband should continue with his mechanic's skill to increase the family income.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of her group members too need a loan to do better with their respective businesses. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1267976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":" to buy more tables and benches to expand her tea stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T09:16:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T09:16:22Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dhaneshori","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baruni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pasot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-02T07:16:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512951,"name":"Apunba Chanura Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Apunba Chanura Group consisting of 10 members. These hard working Meitei women belong to a non-tribal community. They come together to support one another and live in a small village on the outskirts of Imphal East in Manipur state, which is in the Northeastern part of India.\r\n \r\nPremeshori is the profiled member pictured with her hand raised. She is 30 years old and is a mother to three daughters and two sons. Her husband is a hired carpenter by profession. The three older children go to a private school nearby. In order to supplement the family income before the loan, she earned an income by weaving Manipuri traditional clothes for others. She was paid for weaving only.\r\n \r\nWith her first loan in 2010, she continued her weaving activities by buying yarn with the loan. She managed to earn just enough profit to repay her loan liability. With competition in the market, she could not keep up with the challenges. With her second loan, the group members decided and agreed upon joint and common activities for profit motives. The group decided upon sand sieving (Quarrying) from the riverbed. They invested the loan of INR 80,000 to buy a permit for a portion of the riverbed to extract sand use for construction. The remaining INR 20,000 was shared equally among the members for their personal use. All the members work together at their owned site. The sale proceeds were shared equally by all the members. Sometimes the group was able to share the profit daily or on alternate days, depending on the business. From this share of profit, Premeshori bought two piglets to raise for her own. Furthermore, she invested INR 100 daily towards the group saving and another INR 500 on monthly savings managed by local investors. In this way, she means to do well for the family and supplement the family income.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too undertook different activities to supplement their income apart from the joint activity of sand sieving business. Small it may be, but with the profit, some members started poultry farming, raising ducks, running a paan corner, buying yarns for others to weave and so on.\r\n\r\nNow the group needs another loan to continue with their sand sieving business.

In 2010 they formed a group and called themselves the \u201cDiana Group\u201d. They all live in a small remote town called Saikul which is in the state of Manipur in the North Eastern part of India. It is about 70 km in distance from the main capital, Imphal.\r\n\r\nThemneo, one of the 12 members, is pictured with raised hand. She is 28 years old and is a mother to two sons and one daughter. All her children go to a private school in the town. Her husband is a cultivator by profession and the breadearner of the family. She helped her husband cultivating rice on leased land. That could never sustain them from buying rice while waiting for the next harvest, because the share of the harvest is one-third of the produce, which is  to say that the owner of the paddy field gets double the share of the cultivator. In order to supplement the family income, Themneo decided to start weaving, the only activity she is good at. In fact, she started weaving at the early age of 16.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she bought yarns and started her weaving activities. She wove traditional shawls called \u201cSaipikhup\u201d and wrap-round skirts called \u201cKhamtang\u201d and it takes about 6 days to finish  each respectively.  During the cultivation seasons she would schedule her time: three days for weaving and helping her husband in the field for two days. She actually made more progress with her business than she had imagined. Without much effort she was able to repay her loan and save money for household maintenance. Now, in order to expand her weaving activities, she apprentices her weaving skill by employing two learners. She has plans to create her own designs and start a weaving school in the long run.\r\n\r\nThemneo has short-term and long-term goals to mention. In order to do her weaving full time she aims to enroll her children in a boarding school so that it will be a win-win situation for her children as well as her business. Her long-term goal is to purchase a paddy field big enough to sustain them for the whole year round.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to expand her weaving activities. Having employed two more weavers, she means to use the loan to buy yarns of different colours to weave and sell the finished products for a good price. She also will need money for buying clothing for her three children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1267997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy yarns of different colours to weave and sell as finished products for a good price.

As such, he is a farmer and he has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last ten years. He chose this business because it is profitable and fresh crops are in high demand. People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy.  In fact, many national dishes are made of vegetables such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruit is served at every meal in Azerbaijan and also makes fresh punch.\r\n\r\nAga sells his crop in the Bilasuvar Central Bazaar. His monthly income is 130 AZN. His wife actively helps him to raise the crop.\r\n\r\nAs these products are in high demand, Aga wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover market demand. For this purpose he has applied for a loan of 1000 AZN. He will buy new garden tools, seeds and fertilizers.

She has been associated with Kashf for two years and has a good repayment history. Riaz shared her dream of running a training center for girls in her village. She would teach them thread-making skills so that they can help her expand her business and also earn money for themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":224.89,"image":{"id":1268686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy raw materials such as bundles of wool and cotton threads in different colors to meet the increasing demand for her products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Kasur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.115556 74.446667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-01-02T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-01T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Riaz  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1415},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1457},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1499},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1588},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1635},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1683},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1732},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1834},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1888},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1944}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.31,"local_amount":2872,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3141.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339553234,"comment":null},{"amount":16.86,"local_amount":1499,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1639.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347103087,"comment":null},{"amount":17.36,"local_amount":1543,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355848229,"comment":null},{"amount":17.87,"local_amount":1588,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1737.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364556948,"comment":null},{"amount":18.39,"local_amount":1635,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1788.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372955447,"comment":null},{"amount":38.42,"local_amount":3415,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3735.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390822324,"comment":null},{"amount":20.05,"local_amount":1782,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1949.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399842763,"comment":null},{"amount":20.63,"local_amount":1834,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2006.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410117485,"comment":null},{"amount":21.13,"local_amount":1888,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2065.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":419882731,"comment":null},{"amount":21.87,"local_amount":1944,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2126.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439755209,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-02T16:32:34Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:40:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513197,"name":"Hawa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hawa, 30, is very hardworking and determined in her business.

She is proud of her business because she is able to contribute toward supporting her family's needs.\r\n\r\nTetee has three children between the ages of two and six years old. The family lives in Buchanan, a town that is noted for fishing. The children live at home under her care and attend school. Tetee herself had to stop her education in the sixth grade. \r\n\r\nShe sells her products 10 hours a day, and she tends to make consistent profits because she sells quality blouses and cosmetics. \r\n \r\nShe is requesting a loan in order to purchase more blouses and cosmetics to offer for sale through her business. Her dream for the future is to buy land and build a decent house for the family.\r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva lenders for empowering her in her business.

The loan will be used to buy materials for mending clothes and will help Mwamini  to generate greater profits and boost the business. Mwamini  hopes that in the future she will be able to add more money to the business. \r\n\r\nMwamini  is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past 2 years, Veronica has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells raw food such as Irish potatoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Veronica has requested a loan of 500000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase her inventory and buy more raw food for the business and will help Veronica to generate greater profits and start another business. Veronica hopes that in the future she will be able to extend the business. \r\n\r\nVeronica is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

The loan will be used to purchase a generator that will help her set up another video cinema and help Catherine to raise more profits to add to the business. Catherine  hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house.\n\nCatherine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The loan will be used to purchase more soft drinks, such as lemonade and passion fruit juice, to sell, and this will help Elizabeth to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Elizabeth hopes that she will be able to build a house of her own in the future. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The loan will be used to buy more raw food such as cassava and sweet potatoes for resale, and will help Elizabeth to generate greater profits and pay for her child's medical bills.

For the past one year, Judith has been working hard to manage her small business, selling fast foods such as pancakes and vegetable sabusas. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Judith has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. She will use the loan to buy more vegetables and wheat flour, which will be used for making sabusas. The loan will help Judith to generate greater profits and improve her stardand of living. Judith hopes that in the future, she will be able to build her own house. \r\n\r\nJudith is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her household as much as possible, because she lives in a common-law relationship and has a child.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says she likes the loan and health trainings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":1268913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy electronic devices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-01-02T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-01T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalia Elizabeth\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe Ivonne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliza\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulma Marianela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natty Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":29292.92,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3951.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4223.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4223.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4223.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4223.49},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4223.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4223.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":573.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":573.31,"local_amount":3951.48,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3961.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617536,"comment":null},{"amount":612.77,"local_amount":4223.49,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4234.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172130,"comment":null},{"amount":612.77,"local_amount":4223.49,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4234.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914348,"comment":null},{"amount":612.77,"local_amount":4223.49,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4234.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625336,"comment":null},{"amount":612.77,"local_amount":4223.49,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4234.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021293,"comment":null},{"amount":612.77,"local_amount":4223.49,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4234.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809103,"comment":null},{"amount":612.84,"local_amount":4223.99,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4234.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669182,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T14:35:50Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:17:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513263,"name":"Cira Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cira del Socorro a sus 60 a\u00f1os de edad es conocida en su comunidad como una mujer esforzada por sacar adelante a su familia.

For 12 years, he has worked selling sweets outside of the schools in his city. \"Even though this work isn't making me a millionaire, at least it staves off hunger in my home.\" With these words, Gregorio declares that his work has been a blessing, because it has allowed him to educate his children and bring home food every day. His biggest dream is to be able to launch a well-stocked store in order to increase his income and buy his family the house that they long for. He knows that the only way to achieve this dream is to work hard. This is why he doesn't brood over when to get up and start his work.

They are from the municipality of Malpaisillo in the department of Le\u00f3n, which is located in the western part of the country. Le\u00f3n is characterized by hardworking, responsible, and friendly people.\r\n\r\nThis bank decided to unite and take advantage of the benefits of a loan to work in their different businesses. They know each other and support each other to succeed. The bank's coordinator is Alejandra Catalina. She makes a living with a small grocery store, or \"pulper\u00eda,\" located in her home. A pulper\u00eda is a small store which sells groceries in small quantities such as coffee, shampoo, rice, cooked beans, oil, soap, juice, soda, cookies, detergent, bread, and eggs. Alejandra's daily routine is to work for 10 hours attending clients. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this loan is to invest in working capital and stock her small business in order to offer a better service to the people of her neighborhood. The communal bank is grateful for the help which Kiva lenders provide to people with limited resources in countries lacking sources of employment, such as Nicaragua, so that they can have a decent

She is married with four children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Virginia responds that she likes the health area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1269009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice and noodles in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-01-02T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-01T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia Ines\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuela Julieta\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deysi Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina Lucia\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romualda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deysy Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":17171.7,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2841.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2866.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.01},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":413.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":413.68,"local_amount":2841.44,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2858.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617539,"comment":null},{"amount":417.26,"local_amount":2866.01,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172134,"comment":null},{"amount":417.26,"local_amount":2866.01,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914352,"comment":null},{"amount":417.25,"local_amount":2866.01,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625340,"comment":null},{"amount":417.26,"local_amount":2866.01,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021297,"comment":null},{"amount":417.29,"local_amount":2866.22,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809107,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T04:32:31Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:30:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513342,"name":"Nelson Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelson, vive con su Mam\u00e1, aprendi\u00f3 a hacer pan ya que su familia se dedicaba  a una tienda,  su estado civil es soltera y las personas que dependen de \u00e9l es su Mama.\nManifiesta que recibi\u00f3 capacitaci\u00f3n de panificaci\u00f3n y como le fue bien en la venta, se dedico a hacerlo el cual se convirti\u00f3 en una proveedora de las tiendas vecinas.\nEst\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito lo cual lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de mobiliario y equipo y materia prima para hacer el pan, la harina, manteca, levadura. \nEl cual le ayudara para satisfacer la necesidad de los clientes  y ser un proveedor  de la zona, ya que existe una demanda bastante grande donde el reside.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She works selling rice at the central market in the city of Uzgen. She is the mother of 5 children. Her goal in life is to improve her standard of living, to give her children a good university education, and to of course expand her business. She is very kind, sociable, smart, and energetic. She started her business 13 years ago with a start-up sum of only 2,500 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Besides working in retail, she is also actively involved in animal husbandry. Her farm currently includes 4 head of cattle. For the purpose of expanding her business, Saparkul has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som which will help her to increase her turnover by buying more rice. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to re-invest into her business for further development.

Hafez is an ambitious young man and he prepares to start his own business which is a mobile phone store. \r\n\r\nHafez has an amount of money which is not enough to cover all the costs. He is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from Palestine for Credit & Development (FATEN) to cover the cost of purchasing the necessary number of mobile phones to open his store and meet the demand of his customers. Taking this loan will enable Hafez to successfully start his business and ensure better income and a bright future. Hafez is photographed inside his modest store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
