La ventaja que tiene don Maximino es que cada a\u00f1o la cosecha le deja buenos ingresos y con la ganancia compra una manzana de tierra y una bestia mular, tambi\u00e9n que el producto lo van a traer hasta su finca, los inconvenientes que se le presentan es que en la monta\u00f1a no entran los veh\u00edculos por lo que el producto lo tiene que trasladar en bestia, y que en algunas ocasiones entra la plaga y tiene que combatirla con fungicidas. El pr\u00e9stamo que don Maximino esta solicitando lo necesita para comprar fertilizantes, abonar la tierra de la finca y chapearla para que este limpia. Con la ayuda de los prestamos logro comprar las puertas de su casa y cercar su propiedad.

Este es el segundo cr\u00e9dito que obtiene de FAMA y ha cancelado sus cuotas puntualmente.","en":"Mr. Maximino is 52 years old, married, and has three children. His wife works in the home and raises chickens. They live in the community of Las Ca\u00f1itas, in Olancho. He started out working with his brother and, little by little, saved enough to buy a farm to grow corn, beans, and coffee. He has done this work for 20 years and works from 6:00 until 1:00 pm every day. He goes to the farm to fight plagues and harvest coffee. The good part of his business is that each year the harvest gives him good income and with his earnings he buys another plot of land and a mule, also that the products will be delivered to his farm. The inconveniences he faces are that vehicles cannot drive in the mountainous area so they have to transport products by mule, and sometimes he has to fight plagues with fungicide. \r\n<p>\r\nMaximino is asking for a loan to buy fertilizers to fertilize his farmland and clean it up. With the help of the loans he was able to buy doors for his house and fence in his property. His dreams are to improve his house, for his children to be professionals, and to have greater economic solvency to buy more land and grow more coffee. This is the second loan he has gotten from FAMA and he has been punctual with the payments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1074423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-05-03T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-02T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":514.08,"local_amount":9792.04,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-27T08:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":9795.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347061939,"comment":null},{"amount":10.92,"local_amount":207.96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-30T08:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":208.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356489046,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-22T11:13:32Z","paid_date":"2013-04-30T08:48:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":420978,"name":"Yusufkhon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u042e\u0441\u0443\u0444\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0425\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438. \u0415\u043c\u0443 47 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u042e\u0441\u0443\u0444\u0445\u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443. \u041e\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u0414\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0431\u0435-\u0425\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043d \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044b \u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438 STAREX.","en":"Yusufkhon is a resident of the Hamadoni district.

He was born in Valencia but lives in Quevedo in a family home.  \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s a high-school graduate but has been unable to find employment.  Since he has a family, he started a welding shop.  He did well but didn\u2019t earn enough so he invested in clothes and footwear.  \r\n\r\nHis business isn\u2019t located at home or in a locale.  He travels throughout the city or the countryside selling his wares.  It is exhausting because he heads out at 6am not returning home until nighttime.

is a 49-year-old married woman, residing with her husband and their four children in Battambang Province, Cambodia. <p>\r\n\r\nShe has been selling boiled corn and groceries for more than ten years. By doing so, she earns approximately $6 per day. Her husband grows rice and raises pigs, which allows him to earn approximately $6 per day as well. Two of their children are employed -- one is a teacher, while the other is a construction worker -- and they also earn approximately $6 per day.<p>\r\n\r\nIn order to improve her family\u2019s standard of living, Khley is requesting a loan in the amount of $500 to purchase more corn to boil in order to generate more sales to her customers.

He and his family live in the community of Las Ca\u00f1itas, in the department of Olancho. \r\n\r\nTen years ago Wilson began planting coffee with support from his parents who gave him the land to plant coffee, corn, and beans. He currently makes his living harvesting basic grains. He works alone and his work day lasts from 6:00am to 1:00pm. During the harvest season he works full time. Due to the quantity of work there is, he needs to find employees because he cannot do it alone. The advantage is that he enjoys good coffee bean production even though he is paid a low price for his product. \r\n\r\nWilson needs the loan he is requesting to invest in the purchase of manure, to clear the land, and to improve the farm.

Desde hace aproximadamente 5 meses quiso volver a abrir su tienda general, pero debido a la falta de capital en el momento no puede ofrecer a sus clientes una gran variedad de productos. Es por esto que ahora Luz Margarita busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de productos de la canasta familiar para as\u00ed surtir su tienda y poder ofrecer a sus clientes una mayor variedad de productos de modo que pueda incrementar sus ventas considerablemente.\nDe esta manera su negocio seguir\u00e1 creciendo poco a poco y retomar\u00e1 el gran negocio que ten\u00eda antes, de modo que su familia podr\u00e1 seguir gozando de una buena calidad de vida y mayores oportunidades econ\u00f3micas para progresar. \n","en":"Luz Margarita is a hardworking person who has had to overcome great adversities in her life along with her husband, who has been instrumental in offering a good quality of life for their two children.  Approximately seven years ago, Luz Margarita opened a general store so that she could contribute financially toward the household expenses since her husband's salary was insufficient.  However, she was obligated to close her store about a year ago because of family difficulties.  From that point she experienced major challenges.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuz Margarita reopened her store five months ago, but she lacks the capital to offer her customers a wide variety of products. For this reason, she is now seeking the opportunity to access a loan so that she can buy household products to restock her store and provide her customers with a greater variety of products.  This will increase her sales considerably.  As a result, her store will continue to grow gradually and return to the successful business that it once was.  Her family will also enjoy a good quality of life and greater financial opportunities to make progress.

She and her husband live in the community of Patuca, Olancho. Her husband works in the fields and is very responsible with his obligations. Mayra works tending the home and also works in the field with her husband. They are a hard-working and united family. They work together and this makes them get along well as a couple. \r\n<p>\r\nOne of their dreams is that someday they will be able to have children and provide them with a good education and not have them lack anything financially, or in health or education. Mayra began her business with her father's help. He taught her how to farm the land. Little by little, with the help of the laborers who harvested her land and then after marrying, with the help of her husband, began to grow and care for coffee beans. They are both currently working raising coffee beans and they work full-time. This work is their only source of income. Mayra is asking for a loan to be used to invest in fertilizers to improve the farmland. One challenge they face is that during winter there is too much rain and the coffee beans fall off and sometimes are lost. One of their goals is to keep growing more so that in the future they can start another business to generate income in addition to the coffee.

called \u201cEl Atardecer\u201d (Dusk) and it\u2019s composed of seven hardworking, indigenous people who want to improve their own, their families\u2019 and their fellow countrymen\u2019s lives.  All are from Pinotepa Nacional.  For them, their location is a land of humble, hardworking people with the desire of improving their children\u2019s future.  The local style of dress is huipil [traditional embroidered blouse] and apron and the men wear unbleached cotton pants.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Agustina, 49.  She\u2019s noted for being an unassuming, humble person with a desire to help her family.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Tina, as her group members call her, has been making \u201cmemelitas de manteca\u201d (Mexican snack) for the last 20 years.  For her, her business is one of the best gifts God has given her; she works with love and dedication.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she rises very early, at four in the morning.  She washes her corn and grinds it for masa since she has a mill at home (shown in the photo).  Then, she takes her lard and coffee to the market accompanied by her husband, Javier, and her daughter, Guadalupe.\r\n\r\nArriving at the market she prepares the dough in a large tray and adds the lard and salt.  Then she puts the coffee on the fire while she prepares the memelitas de Manteca.  Her daughter, Guadalupe, goes out to sell them among the stands in the market.\r\n\r\nAt six in the morning one of her coworkers, Audelia, arrives to help her make the memelitas while Do\u00f1a Tina heads out to sell them at the entrance to the market; she takes her tray of memelitas and her jug of coffee.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she enjoys her business very much; it\u2019s something that she loves very much and that has helped her provide a better life for her family.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more ingredients to make the memelitas like: two sacks of sugar, one bag of coffee because she sells coffee to go with the memelitas, ten bags of corn, three tubs of lard and two loads of firewood.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she\u2019s very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping all the indigenous people and workers who earn their daily bread with their work to provide for their families.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nAlejandrina-sells food.\r\nAna Laura-sells soft-drinks.\r\nGuadalupe-sells Mexican fast food snacks.\r\nZeferina-sells perfume.\r\nAudelia- sells Mexican fast food snacks.\r\nGerman Enrique \u2013sells costume jewelry.\r\n\r\nThey thank the

lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5175,"image":{"id":1079166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They live in a community called La Mesa center, which is the reason they chose the same name for their group.  This community is known for having a Monarch Butterfly sanctuary and is a place where people come from various places as tourists.\r\n\r\nDon Rodolfo who is the representative of the group is 51-years-old, married to Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Juana, and together they have four children who still depend on them because they go to school.  Don Rodolfo has a carpentry shop that is named \"El Membrillo\" and has been around for 25 years.  He started his carpentry shop because in Mexico City he worked as a carpenter and learned many things.  That is why he decided to put one in his house and thus be able to spend more time with his family, reduce their cost increase, and be able to pay off their household expenses.\r\n\r\nThis time he has asked for the loan to buy raw materials like wood, paint brushes, paint, varnish, etc.  The biggest challenge that Don Rudolfo faces is that he often does not have the tools he needs to fulfill all the orders that his customers have placed with him.  Many times he has not been able to comply with the orders in such a way that his customers do not like the design and they complain that it is very simple because he has not finished it the way they wanted.  This is why it is increasingly difficult for him to succeed in his business.  In his carpentry shop he makes all kinds of furniture for the home, like cradles, wardrobes, tables, built-in cupboards, small furniture, etc.  \r\n\r\nHe says, \"The loan has helped me a lot. Thanks to it I have been able to buy more material although my biggest goal or hope would be to have more up-to-date machinery to satisfy my customers so that they would want to return to order more furniture from me; to be able to improve the quality of life for my children and wife.\"\r\n\r\nDon Rodolfo and the rest of the group are grateful to FRAC and Kiva since they all will be able to invest in their work.  Don Jes\u00fas, Pedro, and Juvenal will be able to invest in the maintenance of their taxi; Do\u00f1a Cecilia will be able to invest in the remodeling of her restaurant; Lorena will invest in the purchase of groceries; Agustina will buy lambs; and Martha will buy calves - all in order to improve the quality of life of each of their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":1079233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy raw materials like wood, paintbrushes, and varnish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La mesa,  san Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-04T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-03T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":3725,"lender_count":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juvenal ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodolfo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":49000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9800},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9800},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9800},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9800},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317564,"comment":null},{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418950,"comment":null},{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568526,"comment":null},{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399827,"comment":null},{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407547,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T04:04:33Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":421189,"name":"Mungunzul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Borrower Mungunzul is a 28-year-old married lady who has two sons and lives with her family in an outer ger district that lacks the basic infrastructure of the Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband have both supported their family by running a taxi business since 2010, while their parents look after for their two sons.

She purchases these vegetables around her village and resells them at the market. Sometimes she needs to go to the farthest village in order to get fresh vegetables to be sold. Yumina does this solely to meet the needs of her family.\r\n \r\nYumina plans to send her eldest daughter Helga to university this year. In addition, she realizes that to implement her dream she will need a bigger amount of money. Yumina is thinking about her business improvement by increasing the quantity of vegetables that she sells.  So she is taking part in TLM through the Individual Lending program and is requesting IDR 5,000,000 for business capital.

She is requesting a loan to buy Swarovski crystals, imitation pearls, beads, glass tube beads, natural stones, wire, nylon thread, copper thread, staples, hooks and clasps for making bracelets, necklaces, rings, etc.  She says that she makes these products and sells them at the university where she is studying.  She says that she has been making her creations for more than three years.  She started the business in order to support her parents in covering her university expenses.  She is studying to become a teacher and is in her third year of her degree.  She says that she is very happy and proud to be able to help her parents because her university expenses are high.  She says that she buys all her materials in the state of Jalisco because there she is able to buy them for a lower price and so can earn a little more.  She says that, thanks to the loans she has received, she has been able to gradually grow her business.  In the past she only sold bracelets and necklaces but now she also sells tiaras with gems, belts with gems, watches and other ladies' accessories.  She says that one of her dreams is to finish her degree and get a position as a teacher in a kindergarten.  Another of her dreams is to have stable premises from which to sell her jewelry.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 members of this group are called Mar\u00eda del Socorro, Reyna, Clementina, Stephanie, Teresa, Patricia, Rocio, Vianey, Norma, Mercedes, Rosa Elena and Jazm\u00edn.

With this loan, Sali hopes to make an average monthly profit of 17,500FCFA, which she will use to reinvest in her business and pay household expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1086495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"San ","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-05-04T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-03T22:10:05Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balakissa      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aw   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-21T08:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":43664.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283252112,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":43664.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411123,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":43664.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449242,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":43664.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502937,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":43664.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268574,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":43664.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498953,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-16T09:53:09Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":419415,"name":"Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alfredo es un habitante del departamento de Teustepe, de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, padre de 3 hijos que est\u00e1n a su cargo, de oficio agricultor se dedica a la siembra de granos b\u00e1sicos  desde hace 15 a\u00f1os.

He is 35 years old, married, and has three children in his care.  He is a farmer who has been growing basic grains for 15 years.  He started out working together with dad at the age of 12.  Back then he and his father only grew their crops over 1 'manzana' (1.68 acres) for their own consumption.  However, Alfredo decided to start working for himself and sowed his crops over 4 'manzanas' so that he could sell his produce and also buy livestock.  He currently grows basic grains.  He has the support of his family and sells his produce within his community and in neighboring towns such as Boaco.  Alfredo also receives income from selling pigs and calves.  He would like to sell his products in other departments where they pay better prices.\r\n\r\nAlfredo is requesting this loan to buy building supplies and farming supplies such as fertilizers, pesticides, manure, etc.  He believes that the loan will help him because he will be able to extend his home in order to keep some produce merchandise and obtain better yields from his harvests.

The members of this group are from a small town called San Francisco Sayultepec where the majority of the people make a living through the cultivation of corn since most of the people are involved in planting.  One of the town's traditions is a celebration of the 24th of April during which they make a pilgrimage.  \r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Se\u00f1ora Ignacia, 53-years-old, who is known for being a somewhat quiet, but friendly woman.  She has two sons, Ramiro and Carlos, who love her very much and wish to help her.  She makes a living with the sale and manufacture of traditional clothing like huipiles (traditional woven skirts), napkins, and tablecloths, and has done so for 30 years.  She also makes a living by making tostadas, selling chicken, and raising pigs, which she has done for 18 years because she really likes to work.  She tells us that she goes to the neighboring towns like Ometepec, Zacatepec, Pinotepa and colonies of their community to sell her handicrafts.  \r\n\r\nOne of the things that she likes most is making the tablecloths and combining the colors of her huipiles and tablecloths.

Toda la familia vive en \"Los Bancos\" que es un cant\u00f3n rural de la Provincia de Pichincha, donde se encuentra la capital del Ecuador. Uno de los principales recursos \"Los Bancos\" es el h\u00eddrico ya que  en su territorio se originan un sin n\u00famero de riachuelos y peque\u00f1as vertientes que dan paso a r\u00edos de considerable tama\u00f1o. Este cant\u00f3n tiene un gran movimiento comercial que se desenvuelve en la calle principal, donde se encuentran hoteles, restaurantes y almacenes, sobre todo de productos agropecuarios, as\u00ed como servicios veterinarios y tiendas para el consumo diario de la poblaci\u00f3n.\n\nEste gran hombre trabajador, se dedica a la venta de madera desde hace 6 a\u00f1os; actividad que la aprendi\u00f3 de su familia que tambi\u00e9n se dedican a esto. Uno de los m\u00e1s grandes obst\u00e1culos que tiene es no tener un medio suficiente para sacar la madera a la venta y por esta raz\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 desea invertir en la compra de mulares para su negocio es decir comprar animales de carga. Esto le permitir\u00e1 a Jos\u00e9 ahorrar en lo que paga por fletes y alquiler de transporte, con ello tendr\u00e1 mayores ingresos y ser\u00e1 due\u00f1o de su propio transporte.\n\nEn su tiempo libre se dedica a estar con su familia, su sue\u00f1o es poder arreglar su finca para dedicarse a la agricultura y crianza de animales. Para ello necesita dinero y esperamos que con esta inversi\u00f3n est\u00e9 a un paso m\u00e1s cerca de tener la finca de sus sue\u00f1os y mejorar su calidad de vida\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 26 years old, and is married with two sons, one of whom is three years old, and the other is just a few months old. Their family lives in \u201cLos Bancos,\u201d which is a rural community in the Province of Pichincha, which is also home to the capital city of Ecuador. One of the main natural resources present in Los Bancos is water. In fact, countless streams are born there, and then run down the slopes of the land as they form sizeable rivers. The community is bustling with trade, especially along the main street, where there are hotels, restaurants, stores, and many agricultural products for sale. There are also veterinary services and many small general stores.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has worked hard selling wood for over six years. He learned this trade from his family members, who also work in the industry. One of the greatest challenges he has faced is how to transport wood down to the market for sale. Jos\u00e9 wants to invest in purchasing load-bearing animals for his business, which would allow him to reduce his costs for freight and renting transportation. This would simultaneously increase his income, as he would be the owner of his own transportation.\r\n\r\nIn his free time, he likes to be with his family. Jos\u00e9\u2019s dream is to settle his estate so he can focus his efforts on raising animals and on farming. In order to do that, he needs to save up more money. He hopes that, with the support from this loan, he will be one step closer to having the farm of his dreams and to improving his quality of life.

In this way, she can cover all their daily expenses and support her children's education.\r\n\r\nTo make her dreams possible, Teresa is asking for bigger financial support from ASKI and KIVA. She is requesting a loan of PHP 10,000, which will be used to buy vegetables, raw pork meat, fish, frozen foods and other basic needs for her food production business. She knows that through this small business she manages, she will succeed. So,Teresa is hoping that her requested loan amount will be granted."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1085281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to
