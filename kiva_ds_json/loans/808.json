One Construction & Project Management Company has been in business since 1985. Its owner, Nathan, is a second-generation contractor with more than 25 years of experience in the construction industry. \r\n\r\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, Nathan was confident that the construction industry would be booming and that his business would be inundated with various projects. However, many residents who were desperate to return to their homes as soon as possible hired cheap labor instead of skilled and licensed contractors like Nathan. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, Nathan\u2019s business is prospering and he still believes that the New Orleans business community is very tight-knit, which makes it unique. Nathan is very optimistic about the future growth of his company as he hopes to one day have 10 full-time employees. \r\n\r\nNathan is very grateful for the Kiva program as he believes he would not have been able to get financing elsewhere because of previous health issues.  Nathan will use his Kiva loan for advertising, contract bidding software, and working capital for materials and

To make her goal come true she is asking for additional capital in the amount of PHP25,000, allowing her to buy more stock merchandise for her retail store. Through this loan amount, she would be able to satisfy her customers' demands and economize her transportation expenses in going to and from the market. \r\n\r\nShe knows that she could obtain her goal because of the big impact of her requested loan.

She lives in the city of Cartagena. She is a widow with four children aged 31 to 40 years old. Since her husband died 29 years ago (he had a store in the market where he sold prepared food and groceries), she had to assume responsibility for her children. She closed his business and started to sell various merchandise in the city such as gold and silver jewelry and general clothing. With her business she was able to get her daughters ahead because it went very well for her. This is because of the support she received from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She has received 17 loans from this organization over 14 years. With this support her life has changed a lot. Her business was very small and she only had one, and now she also generates income and jobs with her microbusiness selling fast food. She has display cases and her income has increased, generating a better quality of life for her. Since her clientele is growing, she requires permanent working capital to be able to respond quickly. The working capital she has is now insufficient and that is why she is turning to a Kiva loan, her 18th loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy materials to make her fast food such as sausages, bread, baloney, cheese and other ingredients. She will also invest in merchandise such as gold and silver jewelry to fill orders her customers have made. Her work experience in her two microbusinesses and the popularity her businesses have in the area make this a potentially great investment that will generate more income to keep fortifying her own wellbeing and that of her family. \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1513.27,"image":{"id":1020203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy raw materials to prepare her fast food, such as sausages, bread, baloney, cheese, and many more ingredients.

is Paulina, forty-four, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. Her husband is Carlos, a technician, and she is the mother of one child. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nPaulina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked viands in her store. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nPaulina hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

is Virginia, thirty-one, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Jimmy, a technician. Together with her husband, she manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVirginia operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, and sell them with a little profit. Her products are men and women\u2019s clothes and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy ready-to-wear products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVirginia hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years.

is Marilou, 37, a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Alan, her business partner, and a mother to her one child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarilou operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sell fire wood for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 9000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilou hopes her business grows more in the coming years.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArgie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 8000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArgie hopes her business will grow more in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1022357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-10T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-09T21:20:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Argie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3423.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998058,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.02,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606598,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2283.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095455,"comment":null},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":570.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359073,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T02:12:32Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400850,"name":"010403-Th\u00f4n Xu\u00e2n Ph\u1ee5-Ho\u1eb1ng Ph\u1ee5-Ho\u1eb1ng Ho\u00e1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Th\u0103ng has a retail business selling\u00a0medicinal herbs.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

The child is still young to be enrolled in school. His wife works as a farmer. He has been a rice farmer for 1 year. He would like to get this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers, seeds, and support labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and it is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1022578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more fertilizers, seeds, and support labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2012-03-11T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-10T01:20:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestin\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":405000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":405000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":405000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":418600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308285135,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-16T03:47:14Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:30:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399897,"name":"Nubia Yesenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nubia, vive con su familia, su hijo, una prima, sus abuelos, ella es madre soltera, se dedica a atender una tienda de productos dom\u00e9sticos, este surgi\u00f3 por iniciativa propia, trabaja en la casa de habitaci\u00f3n, tiene experiencia en el manejo de este negocio.\nActualmente solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de bebidas como gaseosas, refrescos, jugos, gatorade, para surtir el negocio, esta compra le ayudara a mejorar el inventario y poder ofrecerles a los clientes variedad.\nLa aspiraci\u00f3n de Nubia es que a trav\u00e9s de los pr\u00e9stamos pueda crecer, ganando m\u00e1s clientela para as\u00ed asegurar una mejor solvencia econ\u00f3mica. \n","en":"Nubia lives with her family - her son, a cousin and her grandparents.

She is married to Edgar, her business partner, and they have three children. With her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAna operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. Ana earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them individually. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAna hopes to expand her business soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during the evening when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a normal family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use gas to cook food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Bernadette's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasoning. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nBernadette hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

The main items that he makes are baskets, purses, packaging, zippers, etc.  He uses raw materials such as loops in many colors, and with them he weaves and makes beautiful baskets, clips, bags, etc.  His goal is to continue growing and broadening his market with new product lines.

They are taking a loan of 190,000 YER.\r\nFawziah is the group leader (she is the second woman from the right, with the blue handbag). She is 52 years old and married. She is a very efficient woman because, she says, aside from caring for her family, she likes to work and thus help her family. She has four adult children who are all studying. She hopes that all her children will be able to conclude their studies. \r\nFawziah's business is selling clothes, which has been her sole source of income for over five years. She started her business selling articles of clothing in the market in her area with limited capital. She says that it is going very well, that her loan has helped her and that she is very satisfied with the support provided. \r\nAt the present time, her business doesn't make more profit due to the difficult situation in Yemen. So she has applied for a loan of 50,000 YER from Kiva partner AMB to acquire articles of clothing such as dresses, shirts, pants, skirts, etc. to sell to customers, thus giving her the opportunity to improve the income from her business. In the future, Fawziah would like to buy a house with stores in order to expand her business

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

She is married to Ramon, an employee, and she is a mother to her four children. She, together with her husband, manages the household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJoan operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJoan hopes to grow her business into a restaurant in her area and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1025109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":" To pay for raw ingredients needed to make her products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-11T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-10T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4666.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998072,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2666.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606612,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2666.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095469,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2666.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359082,"comment":null},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294302953,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T07:40:03Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:11:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":401322,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is 41 years old and married with four children.
