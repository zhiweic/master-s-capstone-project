They have an average age of 35 and five children.  They all live in the Sirakoro Doufing neighborhood in Commune III of the district of Bamako (capital of Mali).  They know each other through family and neighborhood ties as well as through their revenue-generating businesses.  The group members sell plastic shoes, precooked \"fonio\" and millet flour.  In order to build up their inventory for sale, the group members decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their second group loan.  Ms. Aissata (woman sitting at the very right) is well-known for the sale of precooked fonio and millet flour.  She plans to use her loan to buy five bags of millet and 300 kg of fonio.  The women stock up in cereal at the market in Medine.  To make precooked fonio, one washes it, bakes it, dries it in a dryer, and wraps it in plastic bags. Retail resale takes place by walking the streets and sometimes by pre-order for cash and for credit to customers who are mostly women.  With this loan, Ms. Aissata plans to earn an average monthly profit of 90,000 FCFA that will be used to provide for the education and healthcare of her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1423007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"District de Bamako","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T08:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T08:30:02Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumou               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissata          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":406.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":406.25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:49Z","rounded_local_amount":201834.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207705,"comment":null},{"amount":406.25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":201834.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972396,"comment":null},{"amount":406.25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":201834.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624946,"comment":null},{"amount":406.25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":201834.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850951,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-08T11:20:59Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604209,"name":"Onoria Suyapa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Onoria es una mujer hacendosa, emprendedora y luchadora que d\u00eda con d\u00eda se levanta temprano por la ma\u00f1ana para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus quehaceres diarios.

She works approximately 10 hours every day and thinks it's going well for her because of her dedication.\r\n\r\nCarmen's very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she'll buy a large quantity of clothes to sell so she can serve more customers.\r\n\r\nCarmen will continue to work and make the effort to achieve her big dream of having her own house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":305.73,"image":{"id":1424008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T12:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T12:30:01Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":199.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":210.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":215.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":227},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":232.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":241.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":257.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":261.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":282.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":293.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":304.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.54,"local_amount":199.65,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054775,"comment":null},{"amount":75.6,"local_amount":210.96,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":212.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819671,"comment":null},{"amount":77.25,"local_amount":215.59,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":217.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472590,"comment":null},{"amount":81.34,"local_amount":227,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":228.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695063,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T21:00:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603382,"name":"Dolores","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dolores is 54 years old and she lives in Silang, Cavite, Philippines.

She is married to Erwin, a caretaker, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRichie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  5-PHP's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also has a direct selling business and a piggery for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 9,000 PHP loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRichie dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

","en":"Mirzokarim is 30 years old.  He lives with his wife, his father, his mother, and his brother in Jilikul.  During his 30 years of life, he acquired a rich set of experiences and a long list of interests.  Currently, Mirzokarim  needs money to purchase a car to start a taxi service.

She works at a local cafe as a singer and by this earns her living. Besides working as a singer, Armine is also involved in sewing. She sews different dresses and sells them to her acquaintances. \r\n\r\nRealizing that the sewing business can provide her a stable income, Armine wants to enlarge it. So far she does all her sewing by hand.  Since she has no sewing machine, it is very difficult for her to expand her production of dresses. So she has applied for this loan for help. \r\n\r\nArmine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

She is a single mother of two daughters, 6 and 9, and works on her own to provide them with the necessary. They go to the community school. Estela owns a separate house, but the children are close to the house and to their mother and her siblings in the same area.\r\n\r\nShe owns a business selling tortillas in her house that she manages independently. Before she worked as an employee near her house and there she learned the tortilla business. Later, after some time she decided to do it independently in her house, given that she knew it would be a profitable business to run. She gets up at 3 AM every day to prepare the corn and cook it in the wood oven. At 5 AM, she is already washing the corn in order to go to the mill at 6 AM. She enrolls and takes the girls to school at 7:30 AM. Her mother helps her with the production of tortillas for a while.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will buy corn and firewood. In these days corn is bought more cheaply because of the harvest of the winter cornfields of some farmers of the region. She will pay off a current balance in the CAMPO Foundation. Thereby she will be able to generate more income for her family and that her daughters are better and so that they are not lacking anything.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to have a successful business and that her daughters study and live well. She said that her childhood was hard: her mother made tamales to sell and she had to walk with the crate on her head through the entire neighborhood and she doesn't want this for her daughters.\r\n\r\nShe wants to see if little by little she can improve the house and to construct it of brick or cinderblock, because where she lives now it's made of sheet metal."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":152.62,"image":{"id":1425514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn, firewood and to pay off a current balance with the institution.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estela Karen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":35.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":37.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":38.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":43.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":44.21},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.94},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":58.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.94},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.57,"local_amount":72.57,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":72.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856917,"comment":null},{"amount":42.7,"local_amount":42.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":42.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505180,"comment":null},{"amount":37.35,"local_amount":37.35,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":37.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716259,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-05T22:20:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604116,"name":"Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 esta soltero, es de profesi\u00f3n abogado, vive en la casa de sus padres en la zona de Sopocachi de la ciudad de La Paz \nActualmente trabaja como procurador en el Poder Judicial donde percibe un sueldo m\u00ednimo con el cual cubre sus necesidades de alimentaci\u00f3n y estudio, el cr\u00e9dito que solicita es para ayudar a sus padres a terminar de construir un muro de contenci\u00f3n para que no haya deslizamientos de terreno en el domicilio\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Jose es darles comodidad a sus padres y que tengan una casita c\u00f3moda donde descansar ya que son mayores de edad.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is single and a lawyer by profession.

Thirteen years ago, Matluba started a business, not a farming or herding business like many villagers, but rather in selling children's clothing.  Since she lives in a rural area she has little competition and it is easy for her to be successful in her business.  She buys her goods wholesale at a large city market and retails her goods from her own shop.  Matluba is a sweet and out-going woman, and because of this, she is able to take an individual approach with each client.\r\n\r\nMatluba's home is in poor condition and she wants to repair it because she needs to provide her three children with good living conditions.  Her husband is an emigrant laborer and he won't send money home for building materials.  Matluba is requestng a loan of 7,500 somoni (TJS) to buy building materials such as paint, cement, sand, etc.  She is relying on your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":651.78,"image":{"id":1421598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy building materials such as cement, wood, soil for repairing her house ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matluba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":721.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":778.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":781.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":800.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":838.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":854.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":872.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":917.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":935.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":316.37,"local_amount":1506.53,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1508.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075784,"comment":null},{"amount":165.31,"local_amount":787.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":788.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228444,"comment":null},{"amount":170.1,"local_amount":809.98,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":810.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-08T03:23:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603476,"name":"Nasreen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasreen is a 33-year-old married woman.

She met her husband after high school and he now works at a poultry plant.  He is in charge of taking care of the chickens and managing the coops.  Sara and her husband are the parents of an eight-month-old son.  They live with her parents.  \r\n\r\nSara requested a Kiva loan last year so that she could open a store in her parents\u2019 home.  Her mother previously owned a store that did very well, which is the reason why she requested a loan.  After she gave birth to her son, Sara was not physically able to attend to a business.  For now, she is only able to sell rechargeable mobile phone cards from her house and also cosmetics through magazines.  She has always enjoyed working in retail businesses.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she is requesting now, Sara will pay the outstanding balance of her previous loan.  The rest will be used to start a business that consists of selling clothes for all ages.  In order to buy inventory, she will travel approximately 120 kilometers round trip since the place where she buys clothes sells them at a much cheaper price.  Sara will also sell cheese that she plans to purchase in the city since the wholesalers offer a quality product at a good price.  She will still maintain her business of selling rechargeable phone cards and cosmetics through magazines.  With this loan, she hopes to establish herself financially and help her husband with the household expenses.  Since her son is still young, her expenses are numerous and much higher.  Her husband\u2019s salary cannot go any higher since he is already exhausted and they would like to live a little.  Sara also does not want to burden her parents with their expenses.  \r\n\r\nHer goals include having a successful and well-established business so that she can successfully repay this loan and begin the construction of a house of her own.  When her son grows up, she wants him to attend school, get educated, and become a productive young man.    \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1425316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay off an existing loan and to buy clothes, cheese, rechargeable phone cards, and cosmetics to sell.

She lives with her husband and son, who she takes care of in her parents' house. When she formed her family, she started in the agricultural business. She states that it is going well for her because, thanks to her parents, she was able to learn what was necessary to cultivate and fertilize crops. She also inherited the land she sows today. \r\n\r\nShe states that in the beginning it was very difficult for her to start with little economic capital, but little by little, she learned to improve and she enjoys this, since now she feels proud of it. She needs organic compost for her crops because soon the harvest season will begin. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva and she is thankful for the financial support that she has received in order to get ahead, which is why she promises to be punctual with her loan payments. Magdalena will invest the 500 soles in the purchase of organic compost to nourish her crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":51.6,"image":{"id":1425675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T20:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T20:10:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":44.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":48.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":53.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":57.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":59.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.51,"local_amount":41.27,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":46.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353769,"comment":null},{"amount":17.19,"local_amount":42.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":48.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905525,"comment":null},{"amount":17.9,"local_amount":44.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T10:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":50.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091511,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-09T01:43:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603530,"name":"Rosebella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosebella is 54 years old and married to Peter.

30-year-old Aminata from Moribatown, Sierra Leone. She is the mother of one child who is a year old. She went into the business of selling plastic slippers in 2008 to earn enough money to survive.

Aminata is requesting this loan to buy more plastic slippers to sell so that she can expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to meet this goal as well as pay her child's school fees. In the future, Aminata plans to open a shop.

There is a saying about women like her that \"she knows what she wants and goes after it flawlessly.\"  This is true about Robiya.  Once she set a goal of opening her own business in animal husbandry.  She acted upon her goal and now, 10 years later, she is still raising large cattle.  She is always helped by her loving husband, her children and daughters-in-law.  She learned how to take care of cattle when she still lived with her parents before she was even married.  To this day, she loves being in this line of work.  Robiya is requesting a loan in order to increase the size of her herd.  She plans to expand her business in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":210.06,"image":{"id":1421534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy two cows ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gissar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.524722 68.551389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":338}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.93,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":333.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419913335,"comment":null},{"amount":69.93,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":333.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561423,"comment":null},{"amount":70.2,"local_amount":334.3,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":334.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030326,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-08T03:47:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603517,"name":"Hafeetha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hafeetha was born in 1960.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers rely on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy additional supplies and products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other items needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLiezel hopes to have her own stall and dreams of being successful in life and business. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1329604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for additional supplies and products such as clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics to sell.

He lives in a rural area.  Upon finishing school locally, Abdunabi started study at an institute of international languages.  It was difficult for him to study because there were constantly problems with finances in his family.  After completion of his third year of study, he took a sabbatical and decided to move to China for work.  Once he completed his university studies, Abdunabi decided to remain in China to work, and there earned good money.  However, Abdunabi's mother became seriously ill and he returned home to take care of her and provide necessary medications.  From that moment he decided that he would not leave his homeland again, and that he would always stay near to his mother.  He soon married, and within a year a baby was born.  Abdunabi and his wife are happily married.  In his town he found work with a Chinese building organization, where he works in a laboratory.  His wife does not yet work; she stays with the small baby and looks after the home.  This year they decided to do repairs on their house, but Abdunabi does not have enough money for the repairs.  He therefore turned to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to purchase building supplies to repair his home.  He and his family wait and hope for a positive result, and he thanks Arvand in advance for its support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1421529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy building materials for his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdunabi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":227.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":235.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":243.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":252.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":261.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":270.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":279.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":289.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":299.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":310.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":321.19},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":332.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":344.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":356.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":368.58},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":386.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603557,"name":"Kadiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Sierra Leone!

She began her business, because she wanted to develop her home.\r\n\r\nFanta runs a general stock business; among the products she sells are soft drinks, biscuits and sweets. She has been running this business for 15 years. She works at the business throughout the week, and 10 hours per day.  Fanta says that sometime business is very difficult.\r\n\r\nFanta has requested a loan in order to purchase more goods to sell, including soft drinks, biscuits and sweets. The extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her children's school fees and increase her business. In the future, she would like to become a better businesswoman.

This is his family business that has been passed down from generation to generation.  Bakhtier sells beef and lamb at the local market and for this has his own butcher shop.  Beef and mutton fat is also available for sale.  Bakhtier also sells processed leather derived from the hair of the cattle.  2 times a week Bakhtier purchases cattle for slaughter and sells the meat.  He has regular customers who purchase meat to eat, cook, and sell.  This business provides Bakhtier with a good income, but the needs of his family are constantly increasing as his children grow.  Bakhtier therefore wants to expand his business in order to make a larger profit.  For this he turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to purchase cattle.

","en":"Petrona is 65 years old. She is the mother of 6 daughters and a son. She lives in the community where her parents raised her. She comes from a family of 5 siblings (2 brothers and 3 sisters), who now have their own families. For reasons of life, she did not go to school, since her parents told her that her schooling was work in agriculture. Thus she grew up in this environment, planting corn, beans, and sorghum, and also raising pigs.\r\n\r\nShe married at the age of 17, and from this relation she had 6 daughters, who now have their own households. She lives alone in the community. Five daughters live near her home, and the oldest lives in Guatemala. Her husband died about 25 years ago. The only son that she had died in the war that the country suffered in the 80s.\r\n\r\nShe previously went to Guatemala, since there her daughter has a little farm where she fattens chickens, where she learned this work, and she also does this in the community, although on a smaller scale. She also learned to raise and manage pigs together with her daughter.\r\n\r\nTo acquire the supplies for the pigs, the chickens, and the crops, she goes to the nearest city, which is 40 minutes from her house. To take the bus, she has to walk along paths to arrive at the road.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't have any fixed schedule to do her work, since she needs to be attentive at every moment (to raise pigs and fatten chickens).

Biswakarma Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2009, four women from Bhuliasikuan village located in Nuapada district of Odisha, India, stepped out and decided to build a secure future for their families with their contributions. They formed a group named Baba Biswakarma to access credit from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing businesses. Prior to this loan, the members have already taken their 4th loan from Mahashakti Foundation and have visibly developed their businesses with 100% repayment.  \r\n\r\nJayamala is the one standing third from the right with her hand raised in the photo. She is 46 years old and lives with her husband, two sons of 28 & 22 years and one daughter of 25 years of age. Jayamala hails from a traditional cloth weaving community. She has been running a cloth weaving business with her husband. Presently she has twelve hand looms for weaving saris. At the time of her first loan, the number of hand looms was four. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader 20 km away.  \r\n\r\nJayamala has engaged ten workers for the initial processing and weaving of saris. She only produces saris because of the demand in the market. Jayamala gets 15 lengths of sari per day. A bundle of yarn costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees and it produces 80 to 100 saris.She sells her products to the local traders, who come to take the finished product  from her home on a weekly basis. From this business she earns a monthly income of Rs.10,000, which is not sufficient to materialize her future dream. \r\n\r\nWith the present loan of 48,000 INR, she wants to buy thread\/yarn in bulk.

He sells their milk and milk products as well as their meat to local butchers. He has 15 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father, who taught him how to look after cattle. \r\n\r\nSakir usually buys small cows, raises and fattens them for five or six months, and resells them for a more profitable price to butchers. Milk and yogurt he sells to neighbors. He earns about 180 AZN a month, in part because milk, yogurt, and meat are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in such everyday national dishes as pilau and dolma, and they always use yogurt.
