He lives in Shrosha village, Akhmeta district, with his 35-year-old wife, Nino, and three children (3, 9 and 10 years old). Khvicha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. They have two milk cows and a pig. The cows are milked every day to make dairy products, which is sold at the local markets. From the pig they have piglets and also sell them at the market. Additional family income is Nino\u2019s monthly salary. She is a teacher at the local school. \r\n\r\nKhvicha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the harvested products locally. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGamila requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Gamila has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith the credit, Gamila will purchase a car. After purchasing a car her husband will serve local people as a taxi driver and increase the income of the family.

She is a single mother of 9, and these children are the only ones who help her with her farming activities such as pruning, cleaning and applying fertiliser and manure.  She has no educational qualifications because her oparents had very little money.  It was they who taught her, from a very young age, to work the land and, having done this for over 15 years, she has gained a great deal of experience and knows how to grow produce for sale.  The effort and hardwork she devoted to realising her ambitions enabled her to purchase her plot of land which adjoins the property where she lives and, therefore, enables her to maintain and look after her crops better.  She is currently seeking help to buy manure and fertiliser for her coffee plants so as to have a healthy crop which she can benefit 100% from.  Her ambitions are to provide for her children, since they are the only ones who help her with her farming activities, to fulfil her dream of cultivating a wider range of crops so as to boost income for the family, to allow them to continue their education and, in time, inherit the land which they now work.

With the increased income, Maguli will be able to provide for her son's education in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4200,"image":{"id":1347045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy a mini-bus.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Shua Ghele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-10T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-09T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":4200,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maguli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":4200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":118.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":146.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":147.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":149.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":154.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":155.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":159.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":160.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":163.61},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":171.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":169.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":173.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":175.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":179.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":181.87},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":189.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":191.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":195.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":198.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":202.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":206.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":209.27},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":212.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.6,"local_amount":118.6,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":118.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749690,"comment":null},{"amount":4081.4,"local_amount":4081.4,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4081.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613595,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T16:18:42Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":557134,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is a married woman with five children.

He is married, but for health reasons does not have children. But despite this, Goyib and his wife live happily and harmoniously together, and in their family they have a full mutual understanding. Since they have no children who would take care of and support them, they are left to make a living for themselves. Therefore, they are engaged in their own business that brings them income to live. Goyib works in dekhan farming, growing potatoes and wheat. \r\n\r\nThis past season, he received a good profit from the harvest and he was able to buy a tractor with the profits to improve work performance. In his spare time, Goyib provides tractor services, working on the land for his neighbors and gets paid for these services.

He hopes that Kiva investors will finance his loan so that he can achieve his objectives.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":544.44,"image":{"id":1347097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy construction supplies to build a house for his family","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Haja","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2013-05-10T18:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-09T18:40:01Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hassan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":300000.06,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.78,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":16699.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381616321,"comment":null},{"amount":155.56,"local_amount":33333.34,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":33398.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391370041,"comment":null},{"amount":77.77,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":16699.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411069237,"comment":null},{"amount":77.78,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":16699.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419763622,"comment":null},{"amount":77.78,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":16699.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429413679,"comment":null},{"amount":77.77,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":16699.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439631666,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-23T05:22:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":557181,"name":"Truphosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Truphosa is 34 years old, married to Patrick, and the mother of three children.

He has a plot of land and a fruit orchard where he grows vegetables and fruits.  Hovhannes has a big coop next to his house and keeps his chickens, geese and ducks there.   Hovhannes sells his crops to wholesalers right from his house, which is more convenient than selling them at the market.\r\n\r\nHis wife helps him a lot with the farm, she takes care of the birds with great pleasure.  As she says, it is not easy to take care of birds and you need to know the particulars of raising poultry and love this job.\r\n\r\nHovhannes decided to expand his poultry business and he especially would like to increase the number of ducks and geese.

Vardan's wife works in the police.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age, Vardan has been engaged in farming in his native village. Vardan has 13 heads of cattle and 20 chickens. Next to his family's home is also a plot of land where Vardan sows corn, grows tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, and herbs. \r\n\r\nVardan sells agricultural products in wholesale markets in the city of Kapan. \r\n\r\nHe sells milk, cheese, eggs and meat from his livestock to wholesalers who buy the goods directly from his farm and transport them to Yerevan.\r\n\r\nVardan is pleased with his work and is glad that with his labor he can support his family and help his parents in their retirement. \r\n\r\nVardan decided to multiply the number of his cattle and needs a loan of 1,000,000 Armenian drams

She has a nuclear family with only a boy and a girl. Her husband runs a shop in the main town market and sells essential household supplies. She also helps in running the shop and on the other hand she is engaged in tailoring. She tailors different designs of mosquito net. Although her husband and she hold a graduate degree, there is very little opportunity for filling a job vacancy in the state government. Therefore both of them decided to do what it takes to survive.\r\n\r\nNirmala tailors and sells different types of mosquito nets to the women vendors in the town market and in the city market. She also gets supplies from other tailors; she supplies sewing\/tailoring materials to these tailors and pays their wages once the nets are stitched and finished. With the assistance of the other tailors, she can also produce three or four mosquito nets maximum in a day. Her income has increased with time and she makes good sales during the festival season. \r\n\r\nNirmala equipped herself with the required sewing\/tailoring materials and also informs the other tailors before the busy days begin, i.e., the festival season. The demand is high and the supply usually is short if one does not pre-plan because the embroidered mosquito net is used as a special gift on many occasions. Every single house in the state celebrates the festival during this season, so a gift is a must for every household which is a great advantage for business. \r\n\r\nWith the profits she also stocks her husband's shops with more variety and also makes her loan repayment successfully. She also joined a local Investment Body wherein one deposits a stipulated amount of money on daily basis and once it is mature, one can get back the amount with interest. Besides this she also joined a group savings with the other group members.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva Loan, she will purchase more supplies for tailored mosquito nets and refill stock to sell in the shop. She wants to invest in the shop because she wants to expand the shop in the future.  Her husband is a good businessman and careful with money, therefore she believes that both of them can work hard and be successful in their business. The rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving and tailoring.

I admired the fact that whereas before he had to go from place to place on his bicycle, he was able to save enough to get a motorcycle. From working in an auto shop, he had started working at a jewelry workshop and was doing well. I told him I wanted to learn, and he helped me get a job at the workshop.\r\n\r\nThanks to the help of the workshop owner, the other artisans, and especially my brother, little by little I learned more and developed my skills. After some years, constant training and a lot of effort, I decided to start my own workshop. Like with every new beginning, it was tough at first and I worked very hard to get ahead. It's been more than 30 years since I got started in handcrafted jewelry. Now is when I most treasure what I enjoy doing, because it has allowed me to bring food to the table and provide my children with an education.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never imagined I could receive this kind of help.

She is a fighter with a great desire to get ahead.  She is married and is the mother of 3 children who are in different grades at primary school.  She did not complete any level of education because her parents were poor and could not help her.  They taught her to work the land when she was very young because they had traditionally worked at this activity.  She has a great deal of experience as she has worked growing coffee for more than 8 years.  The land that she cultivates together with her husband is their own, and was inherited from her parents-in-law.  The land is located 100 meters from her house and she goes there daily on foot.  Maria is requesting a loan to buy manure and fertilizer for her coffee crop, because with these products she can guarantee her harvest and avoid it being infected by pests and diseases such as blight.

Abdelkareem appears in the photo.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She started farming more than 20 years ago and her main source of income is organic cacao.  She has farmland where she works with great enthusiasm, since she bought it after many years of hard work as a field hand.  After having been abandoned by her husband for ten years, she took charge of the crops.  On her land we can find organic cacao and achiote crops, which she sells to suppliers in the zone because these products are in high demand.\r\n\r\nShe will hire local field hands and will recover her investments at the end of the season.  At times she has had to deal with setbacks such as blights that affect her crops.  She needs an increase in capital to do this work.  She is proud to provide a good education for her children without help from her former husband.\r\n\r\nShe feels like she is getting weaker over the years and so she wants to save up enough money to start building a home out of solid materials and also start a small business like a food store.  She is happy to be getting a second loan through Kiva and is committed to make her payments on time.  She is asking for 3,000 PEN so she can acquire another plot of land on which to raise cacao and increase her income with greater production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1348127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de terreno agr\u00edcola.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-10T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-09T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":325.74},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":350.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":342.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":373.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":385.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":388.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":411.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":421.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.87,"local_amount":325.74,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":325.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530549,"comment":null},{"amount":134.48,"local_amount":350.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":350.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975575,"comment":null},{"amount":131.44,"local_amount":342.87,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":342.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996844,"comment":null},{"amount":143.23,"local_amount":373.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":373.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864317,"comment":null},{"amount":147.95,"local_amount":385.95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":385.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352687,"comment":null},{"amount":148.88,"local_amount":388.4,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":388.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904452,"comment":null},{"amount":157.72,"local_amount":411.43,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":411.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090511,"comment":null},{"amount":161.43,"local_amount":421.13,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":421.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777286,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-12T05:38:16Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":557838,"name":"Yungue\u00f1itas 27 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de Emprendimiento YUNGUE\u00d1ITAS 27  est\u00e1 compuesto por ocho integrantes de los cuales seis  son mujeres y dos varones que se dedican a distintas actividades, la presidenta del banco es la  Sra.

She is married to Antonio and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJelosil operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php20,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nJelosil hopes that her variety store will be a grocery store and dreams to give her family a good future.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1347508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-05-10T23:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-09T23:40:06Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jelosil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6810.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894941,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5332.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5447.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381669980,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5333.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5447.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534511,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2724.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399783907,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-10T23:58:11Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:53:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":557415,"name":"Alita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alita works hard to support her family.

It\u2019s a poor neighborhood with many limitations.  [Damaris] is a person with many desires of getting ahead.  She has been making arts and crafts for the past ten years.  She is constantly teaching herself so that she can offer high quality products to her customers.  Aside from decorations, she makes quality purses, covers for appliances, bath articles, and products for birthday parties, first communions, and baptisms.  She is well known in the zone for being dedicated to this work and so she is not in need of customers during the year.\r\n\r\nShe began by buying a small amount of items with her husband\u2019s help, began training herself and improving her techniques.  She diversified her production, increasing her number of customers, and improving her income.  The goal for this loan is to buy supplies and some tools.  Schools from the area seek her out to make things for school parties due to the quality of her work.\r\n\r\nShe works throughout most of the day and her daughter is in university.  Her younger children attend school.  Her first daily task is to prepare food for them so they can go to school.  Given the great quantity of orders, she works into the night.  She does her work by hand but once the machine is repaired things will speed up and she can increase her production and spend more time with her family.\r\n\r\nHer main obstacle has been lack of capital, but this loan will allow her to have the money she needs to buy supplies and increase her production and reach her dream of fixing up her hose.  She repaid her first loan and wants to continue having support from Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and Kiva so she can support her children\u2019s educations.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":423.29,"image":{"id":1018605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy art supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Puntarenas, Fray Casiano","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2013-05-10T23:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-09T23:50:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damaris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24049.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24450.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24857.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25271.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25693.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":26121.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":26556.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":26999.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":27449.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":27906.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":28371.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":28844.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":29325.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":29814.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":30311.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":30816.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":31329.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":31832.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.71},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.33,"local_amount":24666.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":24671.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373136010,"comment":null},{"amount":101.15,"local_amount":50573.52,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50583.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391424866,"comment":null},{"amount":57.62,"local_amount":28812.43,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":28818.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410094983,"comment":null},{"amount":105.17,"local_amount":52584.95,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52595.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430063388,"comment":null},{"amount":110.02,"local_amount":55009.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":55020.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439997380,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-11T13:46:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":557416,"name":"Nery","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Nery.

She is married to Arturo, a plumber, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJosephine operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five PHP's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nJosephine dreams of having her own stall for the business and hopes to have their own house.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week.

His family is currently living in his brother's apartment. His wife has the position of saleswoman for a private business entity, and his brother has been doing house interior decoration work on contract with building companies. His two children both go to high school. \r\n\r\nLast year, Mr. Munkhbat began working as a construction engineer at a building company. He is requesting a loan of 3,500,000 tugriks to pay the remaining fee for his automobile which runs on natural gas. The distance between his workplace and home is quite long, and if he goes by bus and taxi it will take too long or cost him greatly.

She is married, and is the mother of 5 children.  Her oldest has finished elementary school, the next two are in different grades of elementary school, and the youngest two are not yet old enough to attend school.  Maria did not attend school at all, because her parents were poor and could not help her.  They were the ones who taught her to farm from the time that she was very young, because it has been a tradition in her family going back to her grandparents to cultivate coffee.  \r\n\r\nMaria has a lot of experience, as she's been growing coffee for more than 8 years.  She and her husband own the land that they work together, because they inherited it from her husband's parents.  Their land is located 50 meters from their house.  Maria, her husband, and their children walk to the fields each day to care for their crops and  make their land productive.  \r\n\r\nMaria is requesting help to buy organic and chemical fertilizers for her coffee crops, because with these products she will be assured of a good harvest, and she will avoid the pests and crop diseases such as the Roya fungus.  Maria's dream is to make her farm more productive, because in this way she will be able to ensure the future of her children by saving for their education, so that they will have a better living standard and more income once they graduate from the university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1347426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic and chemical fertilizers for her coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-05-11T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-10T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-12T17:48:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":557497,"name":"Bidalla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bidalla, age 35, is married with four kids.

is a 53-year-old housewife. She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a mother of four children. Her husband owns a fruit shop in the market, which is the only source of income for the family. He sells apples, bananas, and oranges in his shop. Presently, he is interested in offering more variety to his customers, which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However, due to the lack of finances, he finds it difficult. Therefore, his wife Suriya has requested a loan of 38,000 PKR from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at a profitable price. This will help him to increase his customers and daily income. With the profit amount, her husband wants to grow his business in the future. \r\n\r\nSuriya dreams of spending her life with better facilities and hopes that she will be able to provide a better education to her children.

is 46 years old. He lives in a small village in Kvareli District with his wife, his three children and his mother, who receives a retirement pension. Gocha applied for loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan applications were always rejected because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of the income for the family is from an agricultural business. They have a vineyard and sell wine locally. It hardly produces enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo's evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Gocha applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Gocha has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. \r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

live does not meet housing standards and he urgently needs to make renovations.  Mahmadyor is 37 years old, married and has 3 children.  His wife, Inobatjon, is a homemaker and spends her time raising the children--aged 3 to 9.  The older children attend school and always ask their parents to repair their home.  Unfortunately, their salary doesn't allow it.  Mahmadyor must renovate all rooms and prepare the structure for winter since it is a very cold time in Tajikistan, and a home should be comfortable throughout the season.  Because of the building's shortcomings, the children are often cold.  Mahmadyor is asking for a loan of 1,000 USD to buy building materials for the project.  He and his children await your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1346048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

He is married and has 2 children.  His kids are still little--they're both under 3 years old.  His wife, Nargiza, also works as a teacher at a high school.  Additionally, Umarjon farms since his salary isn't enough to provide his family with all necessities.  He and Nargiza have saved a bit of money to make repairs to their home but they do not have enough savings to buy building materials.  Umarjon is asking for a loan of 3,000 somoni to buy these construction materials.

He lives in the small village of Telavi District with his parents, wife and two children. Murtaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where maize is grown. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMurtaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Murtaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.
