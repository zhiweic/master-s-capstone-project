This doesn't stop her, however, and she continues tirelessly  due to her desire to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan with the desire to strengthen her business.  With the money, she will buy a barbecue grill with 4 burners, a large tomale pot, an industrial stove, an awning, and wholesale supplies (including meat, vegetables, sauces, and disposable goods).

They live in the rural area of Ouelessebougou.\r\n\r\nFatoumata began working at a young age, with her aunt who bought and sold cereals and other products.  After building up several years of experience with her aunt, Fatoumata decided to buy and sell cereals and other food products (peanuts, black-eyed peas, millet, fonio, maize, hibiscus flower, etc).\r\n\r\nThis will be her fifth loan with the field partner, Soro Yiriwaso.  Her previous four loans were all correctly repaid on time.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nNanyanga is 43 years old and has been a farmer for 20years.  Nanyanga works as a farmer to provide for her 7 children.  The community and other farmers know Nanyanga as friendly, hardworking, reliable and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community activities such as the women's group, prayer group and the burial committee.  Nanyanga described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nNanyanga first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Nanyanga joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and as an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Nanyanga plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Nanyanga\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and is able to save money and feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nNanyanga and the Bakholera Alala Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nanyanga","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosamu ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taabumary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":267450,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":654781,"name":"Blanca Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Blanca de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con sus dos  02 hijos que dependen de ella en una comunidad de San Lorenzo, al sur de Honduras, tiene casa propia  y se dedica desde hace muchos a\u00f1os  a la venta de abarroter\u00eda como ser: caf\u00e9, huevos, granos b\u00e1sicos, carnes, frescos, ropa, etc.\nDo\u00f1a Blanca  es una mujer bien trabajadora con muchos deseos de sacar adelante a su familia, est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para de az\u00facar, caf\u00e9, pan, manteca, arroz, frijoles, agua, leche, etc. y tener m\u00e1s productos para su negocio ya que desea surtirlo porque la demanda es bastante fuerte para esta \u00e9poca.

He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers.  Joseph plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, and repair the home, and buy a cow, and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJoseph and the Lukhuna Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.

She works to provide for her four children. The community and other farmers know her as hardworking and trustworthy and as an experienced farmer. Other than farming, she is involved in community activities such as the women's group and the prayer group. As an active community member, she has also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative. \r\n\r\nJackline describes her harvest last year as good but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group. She joined One Acre Fund because she wants to be rich in farming. She has been selected as the Kiva group representative. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving a quarter acre of maize and a quarter acre of sorghum or millet, which is an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJackline first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season. She has joined this season to get the best seed prices and to earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school. She plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and buy a cow. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for farmers.  Her own life has improved because she has more profits from her harvests and has been able to save money and feed her family too. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJackline and the Mkulima Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. The organization will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments on their loan. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To access hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chrispinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":230007,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230007}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":654168,"name":"Philipmeana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philipmeana is 49 years old and lives in Ganta, one of the most talked about cities in Nimba County.

One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 78 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  As the Kiva group representative, Reginalda is pictured on the right of the Bidii Group with her hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nReginalda is 51 years old and has been a farmer for 30 years. Reginalda works as a farmer to provide for her two children. The community and other farmers know Reginalda as reliable and trustworthy.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community in the women's group and prayer group. Reginalda described her harvest last year as good, but she hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nReginalda first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Reginalda joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member.  Reginalda plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and buy a cow.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Reginalda\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from her harvest, and was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nReginalda and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

credits his veteran father as his inspiration for continuing the family cleaning business that caters to military offices and family homes. Oswaldo\u2019s father operated the Ultra Fast Maid for 10 years until his passing in 2012, forcing the business to close. Working as a contractor for the Department of the Defense in Virgina at the time, Oswaldo decided that he owed it to his father to return to California and reopen the company.\r\n\r\nAfter reopening the business in 2013, Oswaldo used his prior connections with the Navy to rebuild his client base throughout San Diego County. Competition for cleaning companies in military complexes is very competitive and all contractors are required to go through extensive federal background checks. However, with the personal recommendation from the admiral who oversaw his contracting work in Virginia, Oswaldo was able to secure permission to serve many of the local military housing complexes in the area.\r\n\r\nWhat Oswaldo loves most about his work is how he gets involved with other people, particularly other small business owners trying to make a living. He also offers disabled military veterans preferred client discounts as he believes that \u201cthere are certain people we\u2019ve just got to give back to sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\nOswaldo plans to use his $5,000 Kiva loan to purchase new cleaning equipment and tires for the company vehicle and to print employee business cards. \r\n\r\nHe currently has four employees and is looking to hire two more part-time employees in the near future. He also plans to expand his services, offering painting and power washing to his clients.

Patrick has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 KES for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatrick is married and has 16 children. He is 60 years old and is known as hardworking. He is active in his community in groups such as the prayer group. Patrick has been a farmer for 32 years. Patrick described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatrick first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2008 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Patrick joined One Acre Fund in order to learn new farming methods. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Patrick plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Patrick\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training. \r\n\r\nPatrick and the Khalundu Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T15:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T15:10:09Z","loan_amount":5825,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepter","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sellah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":502806,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":502806}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":655011,"name":"Inga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Inga is 41 years old from the small village of Khobi district.

Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 74 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDavid is 70 years old, married, and has seven children.  He is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, and trustworthy.  He is active in his community groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  David has been a farmer for five years.  He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDavid first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  David joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family, and send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  David plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  David\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  David and the Amani Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T15:50:04Z","loan_amount":4575,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydiah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johnstone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":395826,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395826}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":655051,"name":"Phuong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phuong would like to take a further loan to buy more noodles, meat and other ingredients to make meals to sell from her stall.

She is a farmer to provide for her six children. The community and other farmers know Rosemary as friendly and a hardworking farmer. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community in the women's group and the prayer group. Rosemary described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nRosemary joined One Acre Fund in 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. She joined One Acre Fund to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and send children to school. Because she is a leader and an active community member who wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Rosemary has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved her life because she has more profits from harvest and has more farm group support. In the future, Rosemary hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school and repair her home.  \t\t\r\n\r\nRosemary and the Budobe Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":5750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T16:30:05Z","loan_amount":5750,"lender_count":152,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Auyimu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oluoch","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":497457,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":497457}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-30T20:29:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643594,"name":"Mar\u00eda Magdalena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Magdalena  tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera, tiene dos hijos: un var\u00f3n y una mujercita; ella vive junto a su familia en el Departamento de Solol\u00e1.\nElla cuenta que actualmente tiene un negocio de compraventa de verduras; la verdura la compra por quintales, posteriormente la comercializa en el mercado.

Benjamin has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo, with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 32 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here, but they will be receiving an average loan of KES 5,349 (shillings).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBenjamin is 34 years old and has been a farmer for four years. Benjamin works as a farmer to provide for his three children. The community and other farmers know Benjamin as friendly, hard-working, and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups, such as the men's group. Benjamin described his harvest last year as excellent, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBenjamin first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Benjamin joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and to earn enough money to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member. \r\n\r\nBenjamin plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, to save for the future, and to buy a pig. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Benjamin\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.

She is the profiled member for Nisorei Group and she is pictured with her hand raised. She and her husband work to generate income for the family.  Before the pharmacy business was started, she raised chickens and sold them in the village and the neighbouring villages.\r\n\r\nAll the group members reside in a village which is about 40 kms north of the Imphal capital in Manipur. They are all hard-working and determined to give the best to their family and kids.\r\n\r\nLhingneineng runs a drug store in the town market, about 40 kms from the town capital. She sells all first aid kits and other drugs. The absence of good hospitals and doctors gives her a good chance to sell drugs in the town. The hospital in town is far away and doctors in the town are unavailable most of the time when needed. The villagers first choice is to purchase drugs from Lhingneineng's drug store and treat the patient before they are brought to the town. Keeping this in mind, she purchases and sells drugs which are meant for common illnesses like cough, fever, diarrhea, etc. She usually gets the supplies from Imphal town and sells them with a little profit. The generated income is meager and is insufficient for the family expenses and kids' education.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more drugs and sell them. With the festive season in full swing, there are so many occasions for feasts, people tend to get diarrhea and have indigestion issues with the winter approaching. She wants to purchase drugs for the treatment of those problems and make more income. Her future plan is to extend her pharmacy and become one of the well-known drug sellers in the town.

Her husband works in agriculture.  Of her three children, only the youngest daughter lives with them, she is in 5th grade.  Doris has worked selling clothing for the past 18 years, but a year ago she started her own business selling fruits and vegetables.  She knows both businesses well because after her father died, her mother taught her how to work in both fields, which is how she learned how to sell products.  \r\n\r\nThe places where she sells are 5 kilometers away.  She travels by bus; everyday she wakes up at 4:30am in order to prepare breakfast for her husband and daughters.  She then goes out to sell, and returns home at 3pm.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to build a wall around their home's property.  The loan will help Doris purchase the construction materials and pay for the labor.  The wall will provide them with better security and peace of mind as no one will have direct access to their home.  \r\n\r\nDoris has many dreams, one of which is to be able to leave her children with a place to live.  She would also like to have a small store in her home.  In addition, she would like to purchase a mill for her son so he can have his own business.  She will use the earnings from her business to pay off the loan and invest it back into the business, so she can always have an active source of employment.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1459941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"build a wall around the perimeter of the property where her house is.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-08T17:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T17:30:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":68.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":78.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":80.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":84.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":89.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":93.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":95.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":103.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.61},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T22:54:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":655093,"name":"Musu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 32-year-old Musu from Wara Wara, a Northern area in Sierra Leone.

","en":"Maria Fernandina is the 2nd daughter of a family from Estrato 2. She graduated from a district school and began to study the technical career of business administration. But this lasted for just 1 semester, since she lacked sufficient economic resources. Maria then went to work in a call center in collections, seeking a means of saving money to pursue her goal of completing her education. \r\n\r\nShe performed this job for 2 months, then her health failed and 7 months passed without work. Then a brochure arrived at her house suggesting the option of technical studies in hotel administration and tourism at another institution. She enrolled and studied for 4 months, pursuing different subjects \u2013 protocol, etiquette, client services, table and bar service. She was very happy and enthusiastic and was drawn into the hotel world, desiring to learn all she could about this career.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as time passed, the economy didn't permit her to continue her studies. Life necessities required her to work in a grocery store in food preparation, without thought of continuing. After 2 years working for this company, Maria decided to continue her studies in hotel matters at Campo Alto, where local contacts recommended she attend.\r\n\r\nDespite an improved financial situation, paying school bills was still a bit complicated. But Maria desired to continue studying in order to advance professionally and personally. She wanted to understand the hotel world, becoming an excellent and exemplary manager of a 5 star hotel \u2013 even to create her own hotel chain \u2013 and she hopes that with Kiva's help, she can complete her studies at Campo Alto."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1507382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay a semester's matriculation fees in hotel management.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-08T17:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T17:30:10Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Fernanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-09T00:00:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":655252,"name":"Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ella es margarita, es madre de una ni\u00f1a, lleva en el programa de auxiliar de enfermer\u00eda 1 a\u00f1o, le ha sentido el gusto y cree que ha tomado la mejor decision con el programa que escogi\u00f3, desea terminar los estudios ya que quiere un buen futuro para ella y para su hija, le ha gustado la carrera porque cada vez se siente mas identificada con el, ya que desde que empez\u00f3 le llama la atenci\u00f3n todos los temas que ha visto, a de mas quiere seguir progresando en la carrera ya que espera que pueda ser una jefe de enfermera para a si poder seguir progresando por si le va bien en la carrera, quiere poder hacer en la universidad para poder ser doctora en pediatr\u00eda, desea el convenio con kiva ya que como es madre soltera y menor de edad aun no tiene una oportunidad laboral, porque vive con la mama y es vendedora y gana el salario m\u00ednimo, la mama es la que responde por ella y por la hija que tiene,a dem\u00e1s de todos los gastos que tiene la mama en la casa.\nLa verdad ella no quiere dejar el sue\u00f1o por el dinero, espera le puedan colaborar, ella agradecer\u00eda sinceramente ","en":"Meet Margarita.

Even though she is young, she has four daughters: Alie and Adele are nine, Nazik is three, and Aline is two. Aisuluu has a high school education and is a homemaker. She takes care of the household and raises the children. She is very diligent, responsible, kind and careful by nature. Aisuluu raises livestock and plants crops to provide the main source of income for her family. She began nine years ago when she bought cattle for 35,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Aisuluu now has four dairy cows, four horses, and four hectares of land for planting potatoes and grains every year.

Safania has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 96 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant one quarter acre of maize and one quarter acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nSafania is 74 years old and has been a farmer for 50. Safania works as a farmer to provide for his 10 children. The community and other farmers know Safania as friendly, hardworking, and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, and prayer group. Safania described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nSafania joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Safania joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer, hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed family.  Because he is an active community member, wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Safania has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Safania's life because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, and more farm group support. He also was able to save money and feed his family. In the future, Safania hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, buy a cow, and invest in a business.\r\n \r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Safania and the Tumaini Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are four additional group leaders in this photo that will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":5950,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safania","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consolata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wandiri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Conrad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Burudi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":513504,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":513504}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":655107,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia helps her husband work their farm to make a living.

Violet hopes that, in the future, she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nViolet is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Violet who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1487192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase more sugar, posho, beans, groundnuts, cooking oil, soap and salt","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kijura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":156866},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":174483},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":187313},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141027},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":146121},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":151398},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":162531},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":168401},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":180784},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":194078},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200886}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-26T21:32:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643428,"name":"Harriet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harriet is 34 years old and lives in the town of Kijura in the  region of Hoima in Uganda.

She is single and doesn't have any children.  She completed secondary school and graduated as a nurse thanks to her parents' financial and moral support.  Due to a lack of jobs in her community, she doesn't practice her profession and decided to switch to farming and business.  Her parents have a farm where they grow coffee and vegetables such as sweet peppers and tomatoes.  They have had the farm for many years and have learned to sell their crops as well.  Their customers include various grocery stores, vegetable vendors, and others.  The land that she and her family work is owned by them and is located very close to their house (they are able to walk there).\r\n\r\nHer future plans include modernizing her coffee and vegetable production, thereby improving the quality and amount of her harvest.  In addition, she wants to improve her parents' house, since they have helped her so much and she supports and loves them.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is asking for with COMIXMUL will be used to help cultivate a small plot of chiles and tomatoes on land which they recently prepared for planting.

As an active member in his community, David also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  David plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his shildren to school, repair the home, save for the future, and buy a cow.
