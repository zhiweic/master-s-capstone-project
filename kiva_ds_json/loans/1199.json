Because of its status as a border county, trade is the primary activity in the region.  It also has the second highest population in Liberia. \r\n\r\nMaima has a cook shop (Restaurant) business where she's been selling rice and soup over the past two years now.  She works 10 hours a day at her business. Her greatest challenge in her business is complaints from her customers about her food price. She intends to use the loan to buy more rice by bag, oil, pepper, vita, fish, meat, etc for her business. She started her business with money from her mother.

This is Suzanne's second loan cycle with HOPE Congo and she began with cooking doughnuts but has expanded her activities during the past five years and now she operates a small patisserie. She will use the loan to purchase the necessary material to prepare baked goods for her clients, such as oil, sugar, and wood that she uses to prepare her fire. She has felt the pressure of increased prices on raw materials in the past and this continues to be a difficult obstacle for her to overcome. She knows that continued reinvestment of profits back into her business is the key to being able to continue to grow her activities. In the future, she has hopes to improve the housing situation of her and her family as her patisserie continues to grow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5950,"image":{"id":1415236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"purchase supplies such as oil and sugar for her bakery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":5950,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laure Francine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suzanne Ramonde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydie Esther Mireille","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alphonsine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Euphrasie Constance","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ang\u00e9lique","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyne Bernadette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charlotte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":2900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":166000},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":167900},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":169900},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":171800},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":173700},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":176300},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":177900},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":179900},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182100},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":184000},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":186300},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":188200},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":190500},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":192700},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":194700},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":198100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":344.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.39},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":369.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":377.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":386.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":399.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":406.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2104.25,"local_amount":1025600,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1028582.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410109341,"comment":null},{"amount":1867.48,"local_amount":910200,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":912846.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874214,"comment":null},{"amount":1571.82,"local_amount":766100,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":768327.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429522868,"comment":null},{"amount":406.45,"local_amount":198100,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":198676.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439746789,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-03T23:21:53Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:34:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598402,"name":"Rolando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rolando is a 47-year-old married man who hails from Talibon, Bohol.

Eight years ago she started her own sewing business in a workshop located in her home. She came up with this plan because of the need to earn money to pay for household expenses.

The business is doing well, but her big dream is to make her own line of clothing.

Then more doors will open up for further contracts and in the not too distant future she will be able to start making her own line of clothing. In turn this will lead to an improved standard of living and a good education for her daughter so that she can have a successful future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":171.03,"image":{"id":1418052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Buy a specialized sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59872},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61524},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63221},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64965},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66758},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68599},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70492},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72436},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74435},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76488},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78598},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80766},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82995},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85284},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87637},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90055},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92539},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95092},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97715},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100411},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103181},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106027},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108952},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111958}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.4},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.86,"local_amount":115928,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":116593.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807438,"comment":null},{"amount":34.97,"local_amount":66603,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":66985.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095523,"comment":null},{"amount":35.86,"local_amount":68308,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":68700.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074584,"comment":null},{"amount":39.34,"local_amount":74932,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":75362.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-15T15:44:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598403,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is originally from the city of Accra-Teshie.

Today he is 32 years old and works in the same square for a fast food business. He alternates this job with selling merchandise like t-shirts, jeans, tennis shoes, and other items. This allows him to obtain the income he needs to cover expenses and basic needs for his family, which includes his wife and their two daughters, who are six and nine years old. \r\n\r\nLuis is a vigorous, hard working, judicious, and enterprising man. He always tries to make the most of the opportunities life brings him, which is why he decided to request a loan to invest in purchasing wholesale merchandise (blouses, jeans, t-shirts, tennis shoes, and clothing in general for men, women, and children).

mother-hero.  She and her husband are raising 11 children.  Umut has a secondary-specialized education.  She graduated from a co-operative college in 1972.  She worked as a salesperson at various organizations from 1972-1993.  Her husband and she decided to get involved in animal husbandry and farming in 1993.  The spouses have an optimistic outlook and progress in life.  They know precisely what they want and achieve everything with their own efforts, and also know how to correctly use and plan financial means for achieving set goals.  They started this business with 1,000 som (KGS).  They have a lot of experience in breeding and keeping livestock and in farming.  Thanks to Umut's and her large and friendly family's hard work, their business now contains two dairy cows, two horses, one mare, four calves, forty sheep, thirty lambs, and also a 1.5 hectare land plot, where they annually grow potatoes and corn.  Her business yields about 30,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as a basis for covering expenses for food and basic needs of the large family.  In order to further develop her business, Umut requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued increase of her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1415980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karazhygach village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T20:21:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599516,"name":"Ramiriza Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"D\u00e9nise  fait partie du groupe  Ramiriza et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

","en":"Leticia, 48 years old, is married and the mother of three children. Thirteen years ago she began to be involved in the world of sewing. She began by working in a small workshop near her home where she obtained her first experience. Later she had the opportunity to work for a much larger business at a much higher salary. There she learned new techniques and perfected her knowledge. Taking advantage of the experience she had acquired and a loan that had been approved for her, she decided to become independent and opened her own workshop where she sews for third parties; for this, she relies on help from her oldest daughter and two employees. In this way she has generated the earnings necessary to help her husband with household expenses.\r\n\r\nLeticia states that she greatly enjoys her work although at times she needs to confront challenges that can delay production. For examples she needs to obtain skilled workers who do good finishing work since it is upon such skills that the continuation of  contracts from her customers depends. Nevertheless, she has known how to get ahead.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she is requesting a loan in order to purchase two flat sewing machines that she needs to streamline production and to be able to finish the orders she has received in a timely manner. This will enable her to open her doors to accept more contracts. In the future, in the medium term, she dreams of producing her own line, expanding her workshop and generating more employment opportunities for mothers who are heads of households. This will not only increase her own family\u2019s quality of life but that of many other persons who influence her business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":220.56,"image":{"id":1418310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase two flat sewing machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia Amparo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104777},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107667},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110637},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113690},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116826},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120049},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123361},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126764},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130261},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133854},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137547},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141341},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145241},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149247},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153365},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157595},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161943},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166411},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171001},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175719},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180566},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185548},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190666},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195924}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":88669,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":89784.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807445,"comment":null},{"amount":56.53,"local_amount":106954,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":108299.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095531,"comment":null},{"amount":58.07,"local_amount":109864,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":111246.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074589,"comment":null},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":111796,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":113202.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009786,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-20T16:09:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":600220,"name":"Alejandra","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandra, de 45 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy amable y esforzada, es madre de 03 hijos los cuales ya son independientes, por est\u00e1 raz\u00f3n vive solamente con su esposo en su casa propia.

He is the father of two children and lives in free union with his partner. Eighteen years ago he moved from the town where he was born and settled in the city, with the goal of seeking new horizons and new opportunities to progress. There he began to work in a business, but after four years, he saw that the salary he earned was not sufficient to pay for the necessities of his household. For that reason, he began to sell fruit from a cart on Sundays. Little by little, he acquired customers, and it began to go better for him, and so he decided to resign from the business and sell fruit full time. Further on, he acquired a fixed location where he could locate his cart, and he has been there for 14 years, working every day from very early in the morning and during the day. He has the help of his older son. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is a hard-working and vigorous man. He focuses on reaching his goals, and for this reason he was encouraged to apply for the loan, with the goal of investing in the wholesale purchase of fruits to take advantage of the discounts he obtains and thus capitalize his business, which will be reflected in an increase in the earnings margin for his sales.

For the past seven years, she has earned a living by running a market where she sells rice, pepper and other food items. She started this business with help from her father and learned how to sell from him. In order to make her business more popular and earn more profits, she is requesting a loan to buy more items to sell. Her goal for the future is to build a house because she already owns a piece of

","en":"Gulola is a conscientious woman who, along with one daughter, was left without a breadwinner after the death of her husband.

In the year 2011, she and five members of her village formed a group named Thakurani to avail loans from Mahashakti foundation. She has already taken the first loan and has been able to give a new look to her shop by increasing the stock. She sells general grocery items like oil, sugar, tea, soap, washing powder, lentils, biscuits, toffees, eggs, etc. Her husband is a mason who always used to move outside for his work. So Manjulata manages her house as well as the business. Her net monthly income from the existing business is 4,000 INR. Out of this income, she barely manages her business as well as her household expenses. Manjulata purchases stock for her business on a weekly basis from the wholesalers in the nearest town, which is 15 kms away.  She wants to increase her stock with this second loan of 14,000 INR by purchasing items like lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc. Manjulata hopes this will help her to increase her income and realize her dreams by constructing a permanent cabin for her business and providing a better education for her children.\r\n\r\nThe other five borrowers in the group are Surudei, Nilendri, Minakhi, Banti and Binodini, who have a puffed rice business, a fish vending business, a tailoring center, a fast food center and a vegetable vending business, respectively\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1415450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase oil, sugar, tea dust, washing powder, lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TETELKHUNTI, BALANGIR,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Surudei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilendri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manjulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minakhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binodini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-14T19:38:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599657,"name":"Jesus-Kpego Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupement JESUS-KPEGO est compos\u00e9 de neuf membres qui vivent  dans le m\u00eame village.

He has been working at a building company since 2009. His wife has the position of bookkeeper at a vacuum insulated windows manufacturing factory. Their children go to high school. The house they live in has been deteriorating over the years so he decided to make some repairs and an extension. For this cause, he is requesting a loan of 6,200,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass and foam.

A pesar de estas actividades productivas que se desarrollan como la agricultura y ganader\u00eda, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares pero en lo cual las autoridades locales se encuentran trabajando para resolver este tipo de necesidades en cada hogar.\nMientras tanto, sus habitantes buscan la manera de llevar el sustento a sus hogares a pesar de la falta de empleo, es el caso de Fernando quien desde hace 20 a\u00f1os estableci\u00f3 su propio taller de pintura y enderezada de veh\u00edculos, actividad que la desarroll\u00f3 desde ni\u00f1o con la ayuda e instrucci\u00f3n de su hermano mayor y ahora la realiza independientemente dedicando entre 8 y 10 horas cada d\u00eda para  entregar a sus clientes un acabado perfecto y puntual en los trabajos que le son encomendados.

With the knowledge he acquired at primary school he has been able to work as a merchant in many areas. He is married to Elvia, who is 37 years old. She does the housework and cares for their 3 children who are in public school in the city where they live, Salcedo. It is located in the eastern part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces in the Ecuadorian sierra. It is an ideal city for merchant activities because of the tourists that go through the city and its residents' needs. In addition to productive activities such as farming and cattle raising, there are worrying rates of illiteracy and poverty due to unsatisfied basic needs, for example a sewage system, which only 25% of the homes have, but which local authorities are working on to resolve. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, its residents seek to support their homes despite a lack of employment, as is the case of Fernando. Twenty years ago he set up his own vehicle painting and bodywork workshop, an activity he developed as a child with the help and instruction of his older brother. Now he does it on his own, working between 8 and 10 hours a day to deliver to his customers a perfect finish on time. Two years ago, Fernando underwent an armed robbery at his business which caused a lot of loss due to the materials and tools that the assailants took. Nonetheless, thinking of his family, Fernando didn't give up and little by little he has recovered professionally, emotionally and financially. Now he needs a loan that he will use to buy paint and materials that will help him to improve his work and get some savings from the discount his suppliers will give him for buying in bulk and paying up front. By stocking these materials, Fernando can take on more work orders and deliver on time because his customers will recommend him and he can generate more income that will help him offer his family a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe lack of capital stopped being a problem since Fernando came to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, where they trusted him and his projects. Through Kiva, they were able to give him an opportunity of accessing a loan. Because of this, he encourages the investors to keep supporting entrepreneurs, especially in his country."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":484.13,"image":{"id":1418616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"to invest in paint and materials for vehicle bodywork.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salcedo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodrigo Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":787.85,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":65.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":75.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":76.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":78.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":79.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":82.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":83.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":85.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":87.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":141.48,"local_amount":139.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":141.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320663,"comment":null},{"amount":67.51,"local_amount":66.48,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":67.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856350,"comment":null},{"amount":275.14,"local_amount":270.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":275.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059929,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T15:40:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":600078,"name":"Exemple De Bord-De-Mere Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Antoine est le coordinateur de son groupe Exemple de Borddemer.

Ahora bien, cuando analizo y encontr\u00f3 esa respuesta sinti\u00f3 paz en su interior para poderla empezar a desarrollar, quieren saber \u00bfcu\u00e1l fue la respuesta que el encontr\u00f3?, f\u00e1cil, estudiar ESTETICA, ayuda a ayudar a otras personas que desean estar a la vanguardia que el mundo nos ofrece en el d\u00eda a d\u00eda y porque no, desarrollar esta profesi\u00f3n en pos de un negocio lucrativo y novedoso.\nJorge es un joven t\u00e9cnico en Sistemas que labora en el \u00e1rea social dentro de una Iglesia y ha podido ver la necesidad del hombre en diferentes \u00e1mbitos, es all\u00ed cuando ha podido entablar una entrevista con mujeres y hombres que desean superarse siempre ve ciertos limitantes, ya que la belleza y est\u00e9tica en nuestro pa\u00eds son temas que van de la mano con el desarrollo profesional, lastimosamente no deber\u00eda ser as\u00ed, pero es la realidad que se est\u00e1 viviendo.\nJorge en el a\u00f1o 2011 inicia la b\u00fasqueda junto con un grupo de compa\u00f1eros de su misma actividad laboral, como crear  maneras diversas de ayudar a las personas que lo necesitan, all\u00ed se les ocurri\u00f3 la idea de iniciar estudios en el \u00e1rea de la psicolog\u00eda y se encontr\u00f3 con un mundo de dimensiones que rige al hombre, ejemplo SALUD-BIENESTAR-FELICIDAD. Poco a poco fue conociendo personas que lo empezaron a impulsar a estudiar no s\u00f3lo psicolog\u00eda sino una carrera que tuviera fines en el campo de la salud y la belleza.\nAhora bien, cuando Jorge piensa en la actividad de la est\u00e9tica no solo piensa en el embellecer sino por medio del internet se dio cuenta que por medio de los equipos el\u00e9ctricos de la est\u00e9tica puede tratar inclusive pacientes en estado \u201cvegetal\u201d d\u00e1ndoles as\u00ed bienestar y manejo de los m\u00fasculos para evitar escaras y\/o ulceras, es decir no solo se une belleza y arte sino tambi\u00e9n salud a esta profesi\u00f3n, porque no ingresar a un mercado laboral o crear una empresa que sea en pro de la belleza y salud integral.\nBien ahora viendo la cantidad de oferta acad\u00e9mica Jorge elije estudiar esta carrera en CAMPO ALTO, por su desempe\u00f1o acad\u00e9mico y la experiencia que tiene a nivel formal en el \u00e1rea t\u00e9cnicos en salud, solo resta desearle tanto a Jorge, sus futuros compa\u00f1eros y a CAMPO ALTO, bendiciones espirituales, celestiales y materiales.\n","en":"Perhaps a lot of people are wondering, why does a guy want to study cosmetology and beauty? Well, Jorge always had this question in his mind, trying to find an answer to this great mystery that many people don't understand. Now, after analyzing the question and finding his answer, he felt peace inside and is able to begin to grow. People want to know what was the answer that he found - easy, to study beauty, to help other people who want to be on the cutting edge of what the world offers day to day, and to develop this profession into a lucrative and novel business. \r\n\r\nJorge is a young systems technician who works in social activities at a church and has been able to see men's needs in different areas. It's there where he began to interview women and men who want to better themselves, but always seeing certain limitations since beauty and aesthetics in his country are topics that go hand in hand with professional development; it shouldn't be this way, but that is the reality in which he lives. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Jorge began the search, together with a group of friends from work, for how to create diverse ways to help people in need. Through this he got the idea to begin studying psychology and discovered a world of dimensions that control men, such as health, wellbeing, happiness. Little by little he got to know people who began to urge him to study not psychology, but a career that was part of the health and beauty field. \r\n\r\nNow when Jorge thinks about aesthetics he doesn't just think about beautification, but through the internet he realized that with electric technology aesthetics can treat even patients with brain damage, improving their wellbeing and maintaining their muscles to avoid bedsores and\/or ulcers. That is to say that it is not just beauty and art that are connected, but health is also a part of the profession, so why not become part of a labor market or create a business in beauty and integrative health. \r\n\r\nHaving seen the quantity of academic options, Jorge chose to study this career in Campo Alto. Thanks to his academic dedication and experience in technical aspects of health, all that remains is to wish for Jorge, his future colleagues and Campo Alto, spiritual, celestial and material blessings.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1415617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to attend his first semester of cosmetology and holistic beauty school in Campoalto.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Humberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.82,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":66935.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780605,"comment":null},{"amount":340.18,"local_amount":635000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":653906.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845814,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T21:52:06Z","paid_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598865,"name":"Macaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Macaria raises pigs for a living.

She never stopped helping her family and giving them more stability, particularly her mother who fought hard to get ahead.\r\n\r\nIn her studies she always stood out as an excellent student, at an academic level as well as socially. Her time at school was not easy because she studied during the morning and the afternoon and used her free time to help her family with the household chores and to help her brother with his homework and looked after him. For all these reasons there were nights when she only slept for two hours, it was a huge effort because it wore her out physically and mentally, but she knew that all her efforts would be rewarded: with her graduation.\r\n\r\nShe began studying nursing, it was a way of making her dreams reality: in this profession she would save lives and help many people.

He has sold hundreds of water filters and also established a network of resellers in several cities in Indonesia. Bogor is a large city just north of Indonesia\u2019s Capital Jakarta. Bogor has all the problems third world cities have: including a lack of access to safe and affordable drinking. \n\nMr Al-Aziz is becoming well known in his city and he has started selling to schools, mosques and Islamic education centres.  Mr Al-Aziz: \u201cUsing the previous KIVA loan I was able to get new clients and increase my visibility\u201c. He is now selling through 3 direct sales kiosks that he rents or shares with others. Besides he has a network of 3 sub agents that buy from him. Besides drinking water filters, Al-Aziz also sells Nazava water filters that make very murky and stinky water clear so that it can be used for washing. \u201cEverybody has a different source of water here, so I need large amount of stock in order to be able to satisfy everybody\u201d, says Al-Aziz. \n\nWith help of KIVA credit Mr. Aziz can have a greater stock with a larger variety of filters which means that he can help a larger number of households with their pressing drinking water problems. By supporting Mr. Al-Aziz, not only his business will be strengthened.

Toda esta experiencia y conocimientos adquiridos, le permitieron iniciar su propio negocio, un taller que ubic\u00f3 en su casa, donde comenz\u00f3 a confeccionar su l\u00ednea propia de pijamas y blusas para dama y conjuntos deportivos. Silvia ha tenido que enfrentar varios inconvenientes, pues en la zona donde se encuentra ubicada, existen bandas criminales que est\u00e1n pendientes de la actividad de los comerciantes para cobrar vacunas y extorsiones, por lo que tuvo que prescindir de las empleadas que le ayudaban y bajar el ritmo de producci\u00f3n, pues pas\u00f3 de laborar toda la semana en su taller, a hacerlo s\u00f3lo los fines de semana, y complementar sus ingresos trabajando como operaria de otro taller durante la semana; todo esto, porque se vio obligada a manejar un bajo perfil para no correr m\u00e1s peligros con el grupo delicuencial.  Actualmente, la cliente solicita el cr\u00e9dito, con el fin de invertirlo en la compra de insumos al por mayor (telas, hilos, botones, el\u00e1sticos) aprovechando los descuentos que obtiene por compras de contado, lo que le permitir\u00e1 tener m\u00e1s variedad para ofrecer a sus clientes y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n, ya que en el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o le realizan muy buenos pedidos, por lo tanto incrementa sus ingresos. Esto le permite so\u00f1ar con cumplir el sue\u00f1o de abrir un almac\u00e9n a mediano plazo, en el que pueda comercializar sus productos y volver a generar oportunidades de empleo, mejorando la calidad de vida de su familia y la de muchas otras personas que influyen en el desarrollo de su labor. ","en":"Silvia\u2019s a 42-year-old woman; she has two children and is separated at the moment.  She\u2019s worked for 10 years sewing clothes, an activity she learned empirically.  She worked as an employee in several workshops where she perfected her techniques and acquired more occupational skills.  All of this experience and knowledge acquired led to her being able to open her own business: a home-based workshop where she started to make her own line of pajamas, women\u2019s blouses and athletic wear.\r\n\r\nSilvia has had to face several problems because there are several criminal gangs in the zone where she\u2019s located that extort and charge protection fees from merchants which led to her having to dismiss her employees that helped her and decrease her level of production.  She changed from working all week in her workshop to just doing so on weekends and added to her income by being employed as an operator in another shop during the week.  She did all this because she was forced to lower her profile to avoid being subject to any more danger from the criminal gangs.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s currently requesting a loan to buy supplies at wholesale (fabric, thread, buttons, elastic) taking advantage of available discounts for cash sales which will make it possible for her to have more variety to offer her customers and thus increase production since the second semester of the year means more orders that increase her income.\r\n\r\nThis allows her to dream with reaching her goal of opening a store in the medium run where she can sell her products and once again generate employment opportunities improving the quality of life of her family and of many others who take part in her work\u2019s

She\u2019s currently 41-years-old.\r\n\r\nShe comes from a family of very scarce economic resources; they all had to work in order to provide sustenance at home.  This is how she learned the agricultural chores.  Also, in order to earn extra family income she makes snacks on days when there are soccer games in the local community field.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is to buy manure and fertilizer for the corn and bean crops because she has 7,000 square meters planted which generates a substantial cost in agricultural supplies.  However, if she\u2019s able to buy them all at once she saves a little money and time because she can get them cheaper and only has to take one trip to buy them because she lives in a rural zone with very bad roads and no public transportation; she has to pay a vehicle in order to make the trip with her purchases.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her efforts won\u2019t be in vain and to obtain a good crop yield of grains because this will be of great economic help to her during the season when it\u2019s not possible to cultivate.  She\u2019d like to get to know her grandchildren and to be able to see them grow up in a world where they can live healthfully free of problems and that they become working people in the communities where they live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":55.75,"image":{"id":1418732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T17:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T17:40:12Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.75,"local_amount":55.75,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":55.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090963,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T21:05:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598857,"name":"Ouynchimeg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ouynchimeg is 35 years old, lives with her husband and two sons in a small house in Bayan-Ulgii in the province of Mongolia.

She says that her specialty is vegetables.  She is known for being very detail-oriented, and these plants need a lot of care so they don't wither.  That is why she earns good money from her harvests and was able to buy her own home not long ago.  Now she hopes to improve her produce, as the demand requires her to be selective.

With the received credit, Dariko will purchase two calves. After purchasing livestock, she will raise them and sell them in the spring for a higher price. It will generate an income and the new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve her living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":87.5,"image":{"id":1416071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Lagodekhi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dariko ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":230},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":230}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.88,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134357,"comment":null},{"amount":21.87,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":36.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107937,"comment":null},{"amount":21.88,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":36.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255471,"comment":null},{"amount":21.87,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":36.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019601,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-29T19:55:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598891,"name":"May","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"May was born in 1992.

She is an enterprising and hard-working woman who never let herself get defeated by the lack of opportunities her lack of education put forth.  She was able to go to secondary school, but she didn't finish.  Nelly married Luis, who is now 67-years old, when she was very young.  Luis works separately from Nelly as a store-owner.  They had three children together who are now all grown, each with his own obligations and independence.  Nelly lives with her husband in Santo Domingo, the inland port that ties the Coastal and Mountainous Regions of Ecuador.  Santo Domingo has become one of the country's most important cities because of the high commerce traffic that exists and because of the agricultural and livestock production that is generated there.\r\nBy taking advantage of the tourist and business traffic, many of the San Domingue\u00f1os have established businesses that earn them an income and, in some cases, provide employment for others.  \r\nNelly started her business 25 years ago selling fast food from a sales stall.  It was very productive for her and little by little she expanded and improved her business.  She works from Monday to Sunday in the evenings and at night, which is when the demand is highest.  Her husband helps her and, in addition, she has begun to stock up her business with sweets and a variety of other items to sell from her storefront.  With the passage of time, her storefront has become run-down and needs some repairs.  That is why Nelly is requesting a loan, with which she will paint and fix-up her storefront so that it is suitable for giving dignified service to her customers.  One year ago, Nelly took out a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.  She invested it in working capital.  She was always up to date with her repayment schedule and now, one year later, she is returning to look for assistance so she can earn more customers and see her income increase.  This will help her to improve her standard of living and have some money saved for health concerns for herself and her husband.  They went through a difficult experience two years ago when her husband fell ill.  The costs were very high and almost ruined them financially. \r\nNelly is grateful to the Kiva lenders, who make is possible for so many dreams to come true around the world.

For the last 4 years she has lived in a rented house with her son. From being a young girl she learnt about agriculture and since then has built up all the necessary knowledge to work in agriculture. She is good at growing plants but since she is an intelligent woman she spotted a need in her town- there wasn't a food store- so she decided to open one. She now has 3 years' experience and in all that time she has been able to acquire more food items and stock her business. \"It was difficult to start because at the beginning I only had the basics, but gradually I was able to buy more\" says Marisela, who gets up very early every morning to serve her customers.
