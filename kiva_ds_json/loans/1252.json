is a true role model for Iraqi women, a great entrepreneur driving positive change in conservative communities. She built her business in a simple, honest, step-by-step process, gaining the respect of her family and her community, showing an attainable business model to many.\n\nAwatef is the owner of a beauty salon, a hair dresser and beautician, a wife, and a mother of two children. She is 48 years old and has faced many challenges. She not only tackled them but also made the best of them. When safety and security issues were putting many families in danger in Iraq, Awatef and her family had left the country to stay in neighboring for Syria and Lebanon for a while. While out of the country, she decided to continue her education and gained knowledge of various beautician techniques unavailable in Iraq. This knowledge gave a little advantage, but she certainly had to walk her career path step-by-step.\n\nAt first she worked in a beauty salon, where she worked for a wage for about 4 years. She then decided to work on her own and start to slowly build up her own clientele working from home. After about 2 years of working out of her home she was able to open a Salon on her own.

In the past, these women used to interact with one another through weekly savings groups' meetings which allowed them to self-finance and support their income-generating activities. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of strengthening the economic power of women, the group has recently entered into partnership with ID-Ghana, Kiva's partner, whose mission is to help them to better manage their activities in a professional way and get more profits. \"Yehowa No\" is therefore a credit group consisting of women who live in the same neighborhood and are involved in different trading including sales of provisions, detergent, cooking oil, noodles, materials, jeans, shirts, bags, etc. \r\n\r\nThe group's representative is named Matilda. She is a married woman who has been selling jeans and shirts for two years. Matilda works from 9 AM until 4 PM every day. With the profits that she makes from her business, she is able to contribute to the daily expenses of the family and save part with microfinance. \r\n\r\nMatilda is a member of one of the local branches of ID-Ghana and she is requesting a loan to buy jeans and shirts for resale. Through this loan, she is hoping to see an increase in her profits. She would also like to contribute to the improvement of her family's food conditions. Her goal is to save some money and, in the future, to open her own shop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":737.1,"image":{"id":1457503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy jeans and shirts for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Teshie, Accra","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":231,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:49:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:49:11Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atswei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atswei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Happy\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":330.92,"local_amount":712.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":722.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429523662,"comment":null},{"amount":406.18,"local_amount":874.84,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":886.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439747582,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-02T10:33:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":624090,"name":"Dede","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dede is a 38-year-old single mother of two children.

My husband is the administrator and helps with delivering orders. My son takes care of planning, sales, and marketing. I do the designing and look after the production, from start to finish. \r\n\r\n\"Our main material is cotton fabric, woven by hand in a nearby town. I'm passionate about this art. It is closely related to the history and traditions of our country. My designs use many motifs representative of Maya art.\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity to receive this microcredit to invest in my workshop.

Now she does not have a sewing machine to sew the clothes.\r\n\r\nShe is a mother of eight children and is motivated to provide for her family. To cope with household expenses, she requested a loan to purchase a machine for sewing clothes. She hopes to get a boost in her earnings. She wishes to utilize a portion of her revenue to provide quality education for her children.\r\nShe is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":53.48,"image":{"id":1458351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a sewing machine for tailoring business.

He has been running this business for many years and feeding his family in a good manner. \r\n\r\nHis shop is situated under the street, and this is the reason only a few customers are attracted toward the shop. Because of this, he decided to move the general store toward the market. His children are growing up, but there is not enough space left at home for their privacy, so the store needs to leave that drawing room. But he does not have funds to hire a shop, to open the general store in another place.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Azra requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan. She will provide the loan funds to her husband, to enable him to hire the new shop, for moving the general store toward the market. She praises for this cooperation, and says thanks to, Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

Over time, he has become well-known in the area, for providing good-quality milk. He also sells butter and cheese, to generate an extra amount of profit. He has to spend the maximum part of his income for fodder to feed his cattle. He gets milk two times in a day.

But she does not have enough money to buy a buffalo. Therefore, Razia requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan. She will use the loan for her husband to buy another buffalo, for getting more milk. Razia hopes to get an increase in the production of milk, which ultimately will help in generating more money.

He had enough funds to cover raw materials, but the welding plant is still remaining to be purchased.\r\n \r\nOne member of BRAC lives in Saima's neighborhood. This neighbor suggested that Saima join and referred her to take a loan from BRAC. Saima contacted BRAC Pakistan for financial support. She took her first loan for her husband. She hopes that this business will work successfully. Her husband will purchase the reaming welding plant so that he can run his business smoothly. \r\n\r\nSaima says thanks to Kiva and to its field partner BRAC Pakistan. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":58.94,"image":{"id":1459103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy new welding plant for manufacturing.

They are very happy to work together and in this way they can avoid labor costs.  Together they hope to sell their crops at an excellent price to the intermediaries that come to their area.  She has confidence that her lifestyle will improve.  \r\n\r\nFor this, she needs a loan to buy 3,500 coffee plants.  She will sow one part of the farm that was not already cultivated, because they did not have enough working capital. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her farm, cultivating all the land that they acquired with a great deal of effort, and to help her daughter culminate her studies. She hopes that her daughter can finish college as a result of more economic resources. She also hopes to improve the condition of life in her home because so far it has been limited.     \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1462312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy coffee plants to plant on her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:49:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:49:17Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-02T15:51:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":627708,"name":"Mujeres Del Triunfo (Women Of Victory) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The nine women of this group live in the small village of El Triunfo in the municipality of San Antonio Suchitep\u00e9quez, Guatemala.  This is a very poor part of the country, where 70% of the people live in poverty and about 25% live in extreme poverty.  The village got its name years ago when the indigenous inhabitants triumphed over foreign investors who wanted to take their land.\n\nThis group was formed when the women heard about Namaste Guatemaya from a former client and contacted them to ask for support with their businesses.  With Namaste they receive business education and are aided by a business adviser who helps them develop and follow a business plan.  The Mujeres del Triunfo are excited about this opportunity to improve their businesses, their lives, and the lives of their families.\n\nOne of these hard-working women is Josefa (3rd from right).  She is 36 years old, and is married with three children.  Her business is selling clothing that she sews.  When she started the business she had some money to invest.  Since then she has had some difficulties; she has been robbed of a substantial sum of money, has been injured, and has had some serious health issues.  Her medical care used up all her family's resources and she and her husband ended up in debt to a loan shark.  \n\nNow her business is on a solid footing and she is paying off the debt.  She plans to use her loan to bulk buy fabric and materials for the clothing she makes.  Currently she works 300 hours a month and has a monthly profit of about Q7,890 (US $1024).  She hopes at the end of her nine months with Namaste to increase her profit to Q9,223 (US $1197).\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":324.72,"image":{"id":1462910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy fabric and materials in bulk to make and sell clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"El Triunfo, San Antonio Suchitepequez, Suchitepequ","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:49:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:49:17Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heidi Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":12900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1433.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.36,"local_amount":1288.92,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1289.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509415,"comment":null},{"amount":162.36,"local_amount":1288.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1289.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733267,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-08T17:43:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618971,"name":"Dadirai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dadirai is 30 years old and married with three children.

We develop our skills by mastering knowledge. Studying any information in detail to determine for ourselves what is now and what will happen in the future. As for me, every step is thought by myself. \r\nI decided to enroll at AUCA, Department of Journalism and Mass Communication. My ambition in this direction had not formed in the last year, where I studied. I was a student of New Generation Academy of AUCA. The past year has given me more motivation than I had previously had. AUCA is the best place for the development of skills. The main emphasis is that the university gives you freedom of any initiative. During my studies, I realized a few ideas and shared them with my fellow students. One was to set up an initiative group called \u201cMedia Group\u201d, which is engaged in the dissemination of information about our academy and work on development of the command system. The group work was fertile, for which we were awarded at the end of the year. Of course, the success of this group was the effort of the entire team, but I would like to mention that it was all happening within AUCA. Now I am very happy to have been a student of AUCA, JMC department. Another opportunity that AUCA gives to every student is a Kiva loan. It is what can make dreams come true. \r\nI am applying for the loan as I have financial difficulties and am not able to cover my tuition fees fully.\u201d

is a student of AUCA, department of Applied Mathematics and Informatics. Here is his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cApplied mathematics and informatics there are 2 keywords, which I excreted. In high school I always studied hard mathematics and informatics, because I really like it. So I decided to choose applied mathematics and informatics to expand my knowledge of these subjects, to deepen my knowledge. But that is not the only reason. The other reason is to improve myself in ways my future faculty may offer me \u2013 logical thinking, programming skills. This choice of mine gives me a lot of opportunities in the future. With logical thinking, good knowing of all mathematics aspects I will be able to work not only as a programmer, but as a teacher or accountant. In general, I can choose any profession related to mathematics or informatics. By choosing this faculty I won\u2019t meet such problems in future, as low level of employment or low salary. Studying this subject gives me a lot of improvements in myself, which is going to help not only my job, but in my life also. \r\n\r\nI cannot imagine my life without mathematics. Everywhere I go \u2013 I use mathematics, even when I\u2019m driving or just walking, because it is interesting. But the level of my knowledge is not enough for me. \r\n\r\nI think I made the right decision enrolling the American University of Central Asia. I will achieve my goals, studying here. AUCA gives lots of great opportunities to its student, which one cannot get in any other university of our country. One of those is financial support. AUCA gives financial support to each student. Therefore I would like to take an opportunity and apply for Kiva loan. It will help me to cover my tuition fees and become who I want

is a first-year student at the American University of Central Asia, department of Business Administration, and here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are lots of people in our country that have to leave the country because of unemployment so that they can be able to earn enough money to keep their families. I do not want to be one of them, therefore, I studied hard since my childhood. I had a dream to have a magic wand, which would solve all problems connected with money. When I got older, I understood that the magic wand of a person is high education and choosing the right job.\r\n\r\nChoosing the right university was not hard for me because I knew what I wanted to do in future. I wanted to have a business that will help me increase the financial conditions of my family, also a workplace where people can work and don\u2019t need to leave their families. Since my childhood, I wanted to be an economist, because I think that an economist is a person who can decide every problem connected with money. However, after researching, I got confused between economics and business administration.\r\n\r\nI studied at New Generation Academy at AUCA last year, and participated in Teenagers in Free Enterprise (TIFE), where I was the class leader. I thought an economist could be a businessman, but while studying at NGA, I understood that this is a different thing. TIFE was a great experience for me, and helped me make the right choice. After all this, I am sure I made a right choice enrolling in the Business Administration department. \r\n\r\nAUCA gives another unique opportunity to its students, which is a Kiva loan. I would like to apply for a Kiva loan, which will greatly help me cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1459181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

I am interested in anthropology, because I loved history while studying at high school, and I also love working with people. My studies at New Generation Academy in AUCA greatly impacted my choice. AUCA gives a great opportunity to learn anthropology. The professors are highly qualified. I would also like to study archeology as part of anthropology because it is more about the mode of life and culture of ancient civilizations based on preserved remains of their life existence. Anthropology is also a creative profession, because you need to use your imagination and abstract thinking to recreate the pristine view of the world of the past. My goal is to study humans at physical, psychological and social aspects. \r\n\r\n\"Another opportunity that AUCA gives to its students is loans.

is an experienced agronomist from Aknalij village, in Armavir region. She lives with her son and daughter-in-law. \r\n\r\nGeghanush works in the private sector. The salary that she gets is not enough to meet her family's needs. To cover her family's needs, Geghanush is engaged in breeding livestock, including cows, pigs, piglets and hens, and in the cultivation of greens and alfalfa. Her son helps her sell the agricultural products in the local market. \r\n\r\nAs their needs are growing day by day, Geghanush needs to expand her agribusiness to be able to effectively meet her family's needs. She needs a loan of USD 1,500 to purchase wheat seeds, to buy fertilizers, to buy six pigs and to purchase some forage for the livestock. She has previously taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Geghanush was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments.

She has been doing farming since a young age when she helped her parents. \r\n\r\nPhorn aims to see her family living a healthy lifestyle and tries her best to increase their personal hygiene in living. That\u2019s why she has requested a KHR 4,000,000 loan that will enable her to buy materials needed to build a latrine and pay for labor costs.

This loan will improve their general living conditions, promote their health, and help to lessen environmental deterioration. Thanks to lenders for distributing their funds in a program like Kiva via its partner, HKL, to help low-income people gain access to sanitation and personal hygiene.

This will help him to increase the variety of stock he offers, and to satisfy his customers' needs and wants, allowing him to be more competitive in the local market.  This will be reflected in an increase in his income, which he can use to continue supporting his family.  He can also continue toward his goal of expanding his shop and adding more products to the variety of stock he already offers.

Luz was always a housewife but, with the knowledge that she had learned from her childhood, Luz has decided to start working in dressmaking as she wants to launch her own line of lingerie and sell decorative items for the home.  The idea for this business came from Luz's need to feel useful and productive.  She is also going through difficult times, in financial terms.  Luz tells us that her advancing years do not let her do manual work any more and so she is starting a dressmaking workshop.  Luz is now applying for a loan in order to buy an overlock sewing machine and supplies (such as material, threads, trimming, and buttons) in bulk.  With these items, she can start her business, which she hopes will provide her with an income to cover her daily living costs.

The family is large and they had little money.  As the eldest, Mar\u00eda had to help her mother and father in the home.  Later on, Mar\u00eda married and had two children.  However, her partner left her with their two children.  They are now in school - one is in fourth grade, the other in eighth. The school is near their community.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda lives with her two children and has to work alone.  She makes a living in agriculture, growing corn on 7000 square metres of land.  Mar\u00eda also raises cattle and farm animals, such as chickens.  In addition Mar\u00eda buys clothes and other items to sell from door-to-door.  She does all this work so as to support her children.\r\n\r\nIt was Mar\u00eda's father who taught her to work in farming, as she used to help him with his crops.  She also looked after her father's animals and the farm animals that he had at home. Mar\u00eda learned about selling clothes a few years ago as she had a very small monthly income.  This low income is due to the fact that the crops do not make any money until harvests Mar\u00eda's crops are located near her home and they must be looked after.  She also pays young labourers to work with the crops.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda must also look after the chickens all day as they need to be feed in order for them to develop well.  Mar\u00eda goes out to sell in nearby places and sells from door-to-door all day long if possible.  She sells clothes when she is not doing farming work.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy 200 chickens, and the necessary feed for them to develop properly.  Mar\u00eda will also buy clothes to sell as Christmas is approaching and she will make more sales at this time.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mar\u00eda hopes to buy her own house as her children are growing up and she wants to give them their own house.  She also hopes to prosper with her children, and, if possible, wants them to go into tertiary education.

A friend, who he currently works with in the market, taught him this activity. He is also involved in raising and fattening chickens and in breeding cattle for grazing. When working in agriculture, he has to wake up early since his crops are 2 kilometers from his house.

Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources, she was obliged to work from a very early age to help with the household expenses. \r\nThanks to her efforts and desire to get ahead, she has a business selling general merchandise such as pants, shirts, dresses, shorts, towels, camisoles, bed clothes, kids' clothes, and underwear. She works about 8 hours a day, and does this from a fixed place. The goal of the loan is to have business capital to invest in supplying her business buying and selling merchandise so that, in the not-to-distant future she can have better income. Angela is grateful to the Kiva lenders for the help that they offer to people who have scarce resources and to poor countries like Nicaragua to have dignified work.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":83.33,"image":{"id":1462884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"for business capital and to supply her business buying and selling merchandise such as pants, shirts, dresses, shorts, towels, camisoles, underwear, kids' clothes, bed clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T22:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T22:10:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":2000.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2096.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199700,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-28T19:44:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":625754,"name":"Maen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maen is 19 years old.
