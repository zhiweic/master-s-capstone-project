She is a widow and she has children. She is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLourdes operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings whene all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 12,000. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nLourdes dreams that her business will continue to flourish and she will have a good life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":160.42,"image":{"id":1423404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken and vegetables and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-09-06T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-06T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.29,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771618,"comment":null},{"amount":103.13,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4596.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478483,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T01:18:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":602834,"name":"Mbeyu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mbeyu is a married woman, with three children who attend school.

She is a housewife, coffee grower, and a mother of four children.  The three oldest children have their own homes and the youngest child is in school and is dependent on her in all aspects.  She and her partner work every day so that they can get ahead.  Gladis did not complete her primary school education since she only reached the second grade.  Since she did not receive financial support from her parents due to the lack of resources, Gladis was not able to continue her studies.  She has been a coffee grower for a long time since she learned the trade from her parents.  Today she and her partner engage in this line of work.  \r\n\r\nGladis is requesting financial support from the COMIXMUL cooperative so that she can buy farming supplies such as 12 quintals (1 quintal = 46 kg) of fertilizer, 12 quintals of urea, and 10 quintal of coffee plant formula in order to maintain her crops.  This will protect her coffee plants from coffee rust, coffee beetles, and other pests and diseases that could damage her crops.  \r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to cultivate a better variety of coffee that she can offer, to compete in the market so that she can move forward, and to someday export her coffee as a quality product.

is 34 and belongs to a middle standard family. She lives with her spouse and four children.

Her husband drives a mini loader vehicle; he provides loading and unloading services to a firm. \r\n\r\nZahra's husband carries metal from one place to another but due to maximum load, the body and engine of his mini loader have depreciated. Now his mini loader needs maintenance, otherwise his monthly income would be highly affected because he does not have another source of income. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Zahra requested a loan for the maintenance of their mini loader so that her husband can smoothly earn income to run their household and to support his family. She is very hopeful Kiva lenders will support her for fund raising. \r\n\r\nZahra is very thankful to Kiva and to its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

Every week, he meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

With the help of savings he has purchased a used auto rickshaw, its engine quality is good but the body is totally damaged. He does not have sufficient amount to buy new body and new seat covers. He wants to start driving, but is still looking for enough capital to buy a rickshaw body. Therefore, Fozia requested a loan for her husband, so that he can buy new rickshaw body and be able to drive smoothly. \r\nFozia hopes that her husband will be able to earn more income because now he will not have to pay a daily fair to anyone. \r\nFozia is very happy after requesting this loan and says thank to kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

Oroskul has a college education and worked at a local school as a teacher of Russian.  She has a lot of authority among the villagers.  As a main source of income for her family Oroskul started raising livestock, starting 15 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 KGS.

A father of four children, he lives in a traditional family in the Massablacoura neighborhood in the town of Bougouni (in the third administrative region in the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nIdrissa has been selling cereals for fifteen years. His experience has earned him a good reputation and he receives orders for cereals, especially corn and sorghum. Three months ago, he also started selling groundnut oil. \r\n\r\nIn order to have the stock he needs to satisfy his customers, he is working with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He is on his tenth loan now, and his nine previous loans have all been repaid correctly. This new loan will allow him to buy four tons of corn, one ton of sorghum, and ten 20-liter drums of oil. He procures his goods in Bamako, Garalo, and in surrounding villages. \r\n\r\nThe cereals are stored in his store until a certain time. He resells them for cash to men and women customers who come from Sikasso and from Bamako. Often, he will ship product to Bamako when needed. \r\n\r\nMais, the oil is sold right away in his shop which is located in a large market. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he hopes to earn an average monthly income of 160,000 francs CFA. These earnings will allow him to pay the interest on his loan, cover his family expenses, and invest in his business. He hopes to become a wholesaler in Bougouni."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":341.67,"image":{"id":1422965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cereals and groundnut oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-07T10:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-07T10:00:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Idrissa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":169747.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624939,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-28T15:30:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603063,"name":"Mwanamkuu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanamkuu is requesting a loan of 50,000 KES to purchase soap, wheat flour, sweets, cooking oil, and tea leaves for resale.

Mamie is from Liberia. She and her fianc\u00e9 are living together, and they have a six-year-old child who attends school. She lives in the Paynesville south area. She calls herself a businesswoman because she is business minded. She finished school after 1st grade. She has a shop where she sells goods such as soap, rice, toothpaste, sardines, oil, razor blades, batteries and drinks. Presently she is not facing many problems with her business, but she would like to increase her sales. She opens her shop from 7am to 10pm every day. She uses a taxi most of the time to take her goods to her shop. Mamie established this business by running a waiter market with a little money from her mother, and learned this way of selling from her friends. She enjoys selling to her customers and she is proud because her business is growing every day. She intends to buy additional goods to increase her sales. Her future plans are to build a house and send her only child to college. She says thanks to those who lend to BRAC Liberia, because \"it is through them that BRAC Liberia gives us money, and we are able to stand on our own.\"

Theresa completed 12th grade, so she decide to keep herself busy by selling cosmetics to improve their lives. She started this business with little money from her husband two years ago. She said; fewer goods on her table are the only challenge she faces now. She likes her business because it's affordable, and she learned about this type of business from her friends. She said, \"I am proud of my business because it's the only means I can help my children.\" Theresa said that with the loan she is going to buy more cosmetics to resell.

The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Barbra who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":337.57,"image":{"id":1423563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more cosmetic items like body lotions to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Matuga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-09-07T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-07T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Barbra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":204143},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":211516},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":219156},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":227072},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":235273},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":243771},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":252576},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":261699},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":271151},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":280945},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":291092},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":301606}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.96,"local_amount":204143,"processed_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":207483.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411561139,"comment":null},{"amount":82.84,"local_amount":211516,"processed_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":214977.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420924029,"comment":null},{"amount":85.84,"local_amount":219156,"processed_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":222742.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429470649,"comment":null},{"amount":88.93,"local_amount":227072,"processed_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T09:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":230787.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440156106,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-29T11:20:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603241,"name":"Elsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsa is a 70-year-old married woman and the mother of a grown up child from Talibon, Bohol.

Sarantuya, 47 years old, lives with her husband and son in an old wooden house on a plot of land in Kherlen, which is in the easternmost province of Mongolia. She has been sewing and selling clothes to local people since 1998. Her husband provides transportation services and her son works as a sentry for a private company. The wooden house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and it needs some serious repair. So she is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to buy building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, she and her husband will repair and insulate their old wooden house. The renovated house will reduce the overall usage of coal for heating thus releasing less pollutants into atmosphere which is significant contribution to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is very hardworking individual who wants to improve her family's life.

She required FDA approval, food labels, commercial kitchen space and ingredients and needed to hire her first two employees. These employees assisted with food preparation and allowed her to perform product demos to wholesalers.\r\n\r\nShonali has since produced a variety of award-winning items, most notably her horseradish mustard and red enchilada sauces, which won first and second places respectively at the Sonoma County Fair. Recently she has expanded into new product lines, such as kale chips, gourmet nuts and sweets. When asked how Kiva has impacted her business so far, she shared, \u201cGrowth is my biggest challenge, and it is frustrating to see huge businesses only get larger when small hardworking individuals are struggling to enter the market. \u2026 Kiva has helped me do that.\u201d\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Splendishes\u2019 reputation continues to grow in the community. Shonali recently garnered the attention of nearby Palomar Airport. Impressed by her cooking, a local pilot helped her secure catering contracts to private aircrafts. Although catering for flights is a lucrative opportunity for her, being on call from six in the morning until ten in the evening can be quite a challenge. She shared, \u201cI have to be able to cater at a moment\u2019s notice, so I always have to be prepared!\u201d \r\n\r\nShonali is confident that her second Kiva loan will open up even more opportunities for Splendishes to expand. She will use the funds to hire two additional employees to enable her business to meet increasing demand as well as have a presence at multiple farmers\u2019 markets simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIf all goes according to plan, Shonali hopes to ultimately have a commercial kitchen of her own instead of having to share a space with other companies. As for potential items available for sale in the future, Shonali says that she is open to making anything that delights her customers. \u201cI\u2019m always on the prowl to find something more delicious than what I made last!\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":730.4,"image":{"id":1185465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney.\r\n\r\nMa. Lourdes hopes that her jeepney will always be in good condition, and she dreams that her children will have a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their lives and business every week.  There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. Jeeps were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipinos, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and with their ingenuity they modified the Jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every-day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet weekly.

previous loan was a big help in her business as she was able to buy the needed spare parts and accessories for her jeepney.

Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRosana hopes to have another jeepney and dreams of being successful in life. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies there. \r\n\r\n*Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers in helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese forces. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney: open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":506.25,"image":{"id":1424257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to pay for spare parts and the maintenance of their jeepney.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":140.63,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6272.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771638,"comment":null},{"amount":140.62,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6272.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824679,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5018.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478503,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5018.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439700917,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-20T10:35:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603104,"name":"Lauren","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lauren, tiene la edad  de 20 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada,  vive con su esposo y su hijo los cuales son su mayor prioridad.

She would also purchase fertilizers and other products to use at planting time, and pay for the manual labor needed during planting, application of fertilizers and other products, and once the crop is ready. This will allow her to do the job well. \r\n\r\nLauren would like to take advantage of the good climate conditions and soil in this area, and wants to put into practice several years of experience handling basic grains. She would like to be able to buy the best quality products so that she can cultivate her field well and have a good harvest. In the short term, she would like a significant output. \r\n\r\nLauren hopes to use the income from the crop to ensure the well-being and education of her family, fulfill some familial obligations, and continue investing in farming. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that Lauren is receiving from FUDECOSUR. She has never had other loans from state banks, but FUDECOSUR has given her the loan without any difficulty and with a much lower interest rates.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1423722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to grow corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Las Delicias de Pejibaye","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T03:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T03:50:05Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lauren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.66},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T01:33:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603360,"name":"Ludmila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ludmila is 26 years old, married with two school-age daughters and lives in the Kaspi district.

Ludmila\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times as she did not satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe then received the loan within the framework of the Startup Program, a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of $600, Ludmila will purchase clothing at wholesale prices in Turkey and sell them in her community door-to-door.  She plans to sell a wide assortment of well-priced clothing for men, women and children.  It is obvious that this job will be hard for Ludmila, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her trading business gradually.

He lives with his wife, two children and parents and grandmother in the small village of Kobuleti district. His grandmother is provided with a retirement pension. Archil has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, as his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Archil was unable to study a professional career. Archil works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize and nut trees. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. Besides this, he has a milking cow and produces dairy products to sell. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Archil decided to start his own business and sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.

He is aware that this major is suitable for himself, so he has a passion for his major. He wants to follow it until the end of this university\u2019s course. He understands that learning helps him have qualifications to get a high-paid job and bring income for his family. \r\n\r\nHe wants to borrow 14,580,000 VND to buy a computer to support his studying. If he couldn\u2019t access this loan, his studying must be interrupted. He appreciates the help of people all around the world whose are raising funds for this kind of program.
