Since 2000, Gulzina has been farming and raising livestock, having started her business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Presently, her farm includes 1 dairy cow with offspring and 1 horse, as well as 2 hectares of land with beans and potatoes, and earns around 5,000 som (KGS) per month. Gulzina's profits allow her to cover the family's daily food and household expenses, while the seasonal sale of beans has brought enough money to purchase a small tractor, which Gulzina's husband uses to offer land cultivation services to the local population.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Gulzina has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to purchase 2 horses.

She works as a retailer and opened a perfume store in a neighborhood of the capital four years ago, which she runs. Her little perfume store does fairly well, but she cannot diversify her business and has low stocks of cleansing lotion. This is a problem as, due to rising demand for jewelry and cleansing lotion, she finds it difficult to satisfy her customers\u2019 requests.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that Benedic has requested this loan, which will help her to buy wholesale supplies of cosmetic products, hair extensions and hair weave. This will allow her to meet her customers\u2019 requests, thereby increasing her sales and, consequently, her profits. She will save part of these profits as she plans to open a bar in the near future, and will also use part of the profit to provide for her

All of her children still go to school. She also has two other people living in her care.\r\n\r\nShe has been raising animals for one year now (she buys chicks, raises them, and resells them). Her business is going very well, but she doesn't have much capital, so each time that she buys chicks, she has to wait for them to grow and then resell them before she can go out and buy new chicks. So, she is often out of stock, which means that her customers are often dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking this loan to buy a large quantity of chicks and some animal feed, which will not only allow her to satisfy her already growing customer base, but also earn more profit. The extra earnings that this loan will help bring in will help her to expand her business (increase her stock of chicks) and provide for her family's daily

just funded a young entrepreneur from Miami, Florida! From a young age, Richard noticed the importance of cell phones to cut family banking costs. In particular, in rural communities like the one he grew up in Venezuela, the use of cell phones to bank online and pay bills dramatically cut back the cost for a farmer in transportation fees to and from cities to meet with their banker.  \r\n\r\nRichard wanted to help more people in his community to purchase cell phones but noted how expensive they were. Richard knew that because he lived in the United States that he could purchase cell phones in Miami for much cheaper than in Venezuela. From this realization, Richard's business idea was born. \r\n\r\nRichard's business focuses on the sale of cellular phones and other electronics to buyers in Latin American countries. He discovered that, on average, electronics are usually three to five times more expensive abroad than in the United States. Richard sells his electronics to companies throughout Latin America to sell in rural communities at a more reasonable price.  \r\n\r\nAs an entrepreneur in his early 30's, Richard continues to study while running his business; all in an effort to better prepare him for future success. Richard was hard hit by the financial crisis three years ago and was forced to diversify his products in order to continue to provide for his family. Richard is slowly taking steps to formalize and build his business in the hopes of experiencing growth that will enable him to hire employees and move to an office location. Richard is requesting a loan from ACCION to purchase new electronics for re-sale to be able to meet the growing demand for his services.

Indira managed to complete her degree in Business Administration at the Universidad P\u00fablica del Valle.  She did this thanks to a full scholarship that she got from the state of Colombia.  She received the scholarship because of her academic excellence and because her family has a very low level of income.\r\n\r\nIndira Melissa's dream is to get a Master\u2019s Degree in the United Kingdom.  The support from Kiva would help Indira Melissa be able to pay for the TOEFL preparation courses and the exam registration fees.\r\n\r\nOnce she gets her Master\u2019s Degree and returns to Colombia, Indira Melissa would like to devote herself to research and teaching at a public university, where she would be able to share her acquired knowledge.\r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nI am aware that studying for a Master\u2019s Degree in management and implementation of development projects in one of the best universities in the world cannot be for selfish reasons.  It is gratifying for me to know that this is a dream that is not only for my own benefit, but that by doing this I will be able to be useful to my region, to my country, in academia, and, above all, to tomorrow\u2019s young people.  That is precisely my vision for the future.  It is a reality in which the work makes sense only when it contributes to the common good.\r\n\r\nBeing one of Kiva\u2019s borrowers would resolve one more of the many obstacles that I have already overcome and those that will come.

She is single, and is mother to one 3-month-old child. She also has a further two people under her care.\n\nNathalie Rosine is a hairdresser, and has worked in this business in a local neighborhood for the past year. Her dynamic nature and know-how have allowed her to obtain a considerable customer base. The constant growth in her customers has meant that supply is lower than demand, and she therefore experiences permanent stock shortages.

She has bought the tools and equipment necessary for a more efficient operation: an industrial stove and a large pot for making soups. Dorys has also used the loans to improve her living conditions moving from a wooden house to the one she has today made of more substantial building materials. \r\n\r\nShe is now seeking another loan, her third with this organization, to buy supplies to make hair accessories, food ingredients for daily specials, and sandals handmade by the local people from the department of C\u00f3rdoba in the north of Colombia.

She is involved in selling various types of household goods at one of the large local markets.  She has been in this business for 20 years.  She does not yet have her own retail outlet, so she has to lease one.  She works there herself and does not have any hired workers.  Stefaniya currently needs a loan in the amount of 20,000 hryvnia to purchase seamer tools, lids and other goods for canning.  August and September in the Ukraine are the hot seasons for canning, and this is why this merchandise group is highly demanded by customers.  Stefaniya hopes that during the canning season her income would increase by about 40%.  She then hopes to use the resulting profit to make a small repair in her apartment bathroom.  With time, Stefaniya wants to have more free time to write books because her main hobby is literature and writing

old, a widow and has a daughter.  In search of a source of income for her family, Svetlana started her own business in sales of children's clothing in 2000 with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, she was able to increase her goods turnover, making a monthly profit of 8,000 som (KGS).  Today, the merchandise selection is limited and this is why Svetlana requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase an inventory of children's shoes for the autumn season.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into business development and also plans to make repairs at

In his five years\u2019 experience working in his restaurant he\u2019s managed to generate income to improve his home\u2019s wellbeing all the time.  Because there was no competition in his area selling food he noticed that this was an opportunity for him and taking advantage of the tasty way his mother prepares food he decided on a business venture that he\u2019s done quite well in;  today, he\u2019s very well known in the sector.\r\n\r\nHis clientele\u2019s favorite dishes are precisely the ones he sells.  He customizes his offers to his customers\u2019 daily preferences.  His usual customers are construction workers, passersby and local neighbors who request the delicious \u201csancochos trif\u00e1sicos\u201d [stew made with three different kinds of meat] which is his star item.  He also sells breakfasts, snacks, frozen treats and \u201cpasteles\u201d (rice-based dough filled with meat and\/or chicken and\/or pork and vegetables cooked wrapped in tied bijao leaves).\r\n\r\nHis clientele grows more every day so his usual working capital is insufficient to buy in volume which is why he\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, his first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy supplies and raw materials to increase his volume of products.

Because of this, her capital is insufficient to buy supplies.  This is the reason that she is seeking a loan from Kiva, with which she will buy beverages and refreshments in bulk so that she has a large stock of available products, and when her clients require more stock, she can fulfill their order immediately.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to add more types of drinks, such as Whisky so that she can capture the attention of peripheral clients and increase the

This town has flat and undulating terrain, warm weather, and a beautiful breezy atmosphere from the beach and the ocean.\r\n\r\nShe has a retail store there, where she offers toiletries, shoes, clothing, and accessories in general, in response to the interests and needs of passing-by customers.

This is their fourth loan and they have demonstrated excellent conduct in their payments and their growth, personal as well as economic.\r\n\r\nThe group relies on assets to develop their business activities which they contributed jointly to demonstrate the solvency of Banco Mujer. They have established their business plan, and care for their homes as well as their businesses. \r\n\r\nApart from the economic help for their business, the communal bank has experience doing things to generate money and to grow. They commit themselves to working as a group in order to move this enterprise forward and to comply with the obligations agreed to with this loan. \r\n\r\nThe communal bank will support these businesses by seeking their consolidation and support other co-workers in maintaining their businesses. The communal bank has equipment and a customer base for the products that they are already selling. They are a united group, and they have complied with the requested loan terms for the formation of Banco Mujer with respect to the training process and by demonstrating commitment and punctuality in

When Kashf foundation started its operations in her town in 2007, she was approached by a Kashf foundation business development officer, and she decided to seek a small loan in order to fast-track her business growth. \r\n\r\nThis played a vital role in her business growth as she had limited access to capital before. Now she has one employee, and her business has grown to a reasonable level in the past five years since her association with Kashf foundation. \r\n\r\nShe has three children, all in school.  Her husband also assists her by buying stocks of goods from the market.  He is very supportive of her; that is why she is able to give proper time at the store.

is 32 years old and lives in the town of Lyantonde in the Mbarara region of Uganda. He is single and has one child. For the past 6 years, Amos has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells rice, maize flour and dry beans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Amos has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Amos to generate greater profits and improve his family standards of living. Amos hopes that in the future he will be able to have the best stocked shop in the center and own a mini supermarket. \r\n\r\nAmos is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Amos who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1182420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She's married and a mother to three children. Olma is very hard working and driven. She began sewing in her childhood. She would sew dresses for women and girls in her village after school in order to support her family. She continued to sew after marriage while helping her husband raise cattle. She would fatten the cattle and her husband would sell the meat so that they could feed their children. This has been their livelihood for the past twenty years. \r\n\r\nOlma wants her children to receive a good education.

is 52 years old and lives in a small village with her family. She has a husband, a grown son and a daughter-in-law. Her husband has chronic health problems and gets a relevant pension from the local government. Marine\u2019s son works at a warehouse and gets a monthly salary. Marine is involved in the dairy business. In particular, she has a milk cow and a calf. Marine milks the cow every day and produces cheese, which is sold locally. She is a very hard-working woman, with a rich experience in her work.\r\nMarine requested a loan for purchasing food for cattle.  She will purchase hay, which will be used for feeding the cow during the fall and winter seasons. Hay is cheap now and the price increases by 30-40% in the fall months. Marine significantly saves on the costs of feeding the cows. Since the cows will be fed properly in winter, they will give a planned amount of milk to the family.

He has two children, 23 and 16 years old who both attend school. He is the only financial supporter for his family.\r\n\r\nFor the past eight years, Tomor has been selling and transporting goods with his truck. The services he has been offering to locals are in demand in the region where he serves. Through these services, he has been able to build a little house for his family. Recently, his truck broke down and now needs repairing. This is the reason why he is requesting a loan from Kiva and hopes that lenders will be supporting him. In return, his promise is that he will pay back the loan just like he has in the past the other three

By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  \r\n\r\nWhile a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Sabita plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.

She lives with her parents and several siblings in a rural area of Pachaj, Totonicap\u00e1n, Guatemala. \r\n\r\nMariela is a weaver.  She uses the ancient back-strap loom method, learned from her mother from a young age, to hand-weave a variety of products.  She sells her pieces on the side of a road in a market that is about 20 minutes from her home. \r\n\r\nDespite her young age, Mariela believes that she has overcome many challenges in her life.  Although she was an outstanding student, family circumstances forced her to drop out of school in the sixth grade.  She remains very positive and is focusing her energy and passion on building her business.\r\n\r\nMariela is so excited to have found Friendship Bridge.  This will be her first loan cycle with the organization and her first experience with a microloan.  With her new loan, she plans to buy a sewing machine to start a new garment business. Mariela says, \"I am so happy to receive this loan, since it will ignite my dream.\"\r\n\r\nAlong with Mariela, eight additional women make up the Trust Bank Corazon (heart).  These ladies meet once a month with Friendship Bridge staff to receive a participatory non-formal education, which will help to reinforce their knowledge in important aspects in daily life, such as women's health, self-esteem, hygiene, loan and business management and administration, among others. \r\n\r\nMariela indicates that she is very happy to be able to meet with her friends for these meetings over next 12 months (the length of the loan).  Her loan will not only provide essential capital to start her dream business, but the participatory lessons will also allow her to continue her education.

Each one of these ladies have paid back their loans successfully, and now they all are moving to a new loan cycle.\r\n\r\nThe first loan was a huge boost for Ceferina\u2019s business because it gave her three potential new clients, who are demanding considerable amounts of products. Ceferina and her husband have recently employed five people. They supply them with materials so they can finish making the products. That way Cerefina can cover all the demands of her customers.  \r\n\r\nCeferina did not hesitate to start a new loan cycle with Friendship Bridge Organization because she has more demand than usual for this time of the year. She will use this new loan to buy fabric and thread to distribute to her employees so they can start working on the existing orders. Ceferena is satisfied that she is able to support other people\u2019s economy by giving jobs to these five people, who also have large families.\r\n\r\nCeferina in turn appreciates the effort and dedication of people throughout the world who are supporting the progress of rural communities in Guatemala, where access to loans is limited, but there are people who trust and believe in them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":1182770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy

He then dedicated himself to transportation and 35 years later decided to start a small neighborhood grocery store in the northern Barranquilla, when he had enough money he was able to buy his own home and opened a small space and started his business. Today he sells basic household items, 30% of his sales are on credit and 70% are cash.
