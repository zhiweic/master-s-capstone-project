What she likes most about that business is preparing the meat and the chili pepper to make the chorizo. \r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to expand her business to give her three-year-old little daughter a better life and a better education.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more lambs to sell wholesale and retail.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are the following: Lucila sells meat, Salustia sells clothing, Artemio sells livestock, Eliodora Margarita sells food, Regina sells beverages, Sandra Norberta sells food, Evodia sells food, Amada Mauricia sells food, and Elizabeth sells sweets.  They thank the foundation for helping all the humble people who want to improve their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":1094768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy lambs to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"MANCUERNAS, OAXACA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-30T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-29T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salustia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ariheyi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Artemio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Eliodora Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Norberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evodia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amada Mauricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":59000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3687.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1593.75,"local_amount":22125,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":22206.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419050,"comment":null},{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":14750,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":14804.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568625,"comment":null},{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":14750,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-01T08:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":14804.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399914,"comment":null},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":7375,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7402.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407590,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T01:03:52Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":431259,"name":"Gulnar","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0443\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0440  -

Both of her daughters go to school. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is a milk cow. The family consumes about half of the dairy products and the rest is sold in the village. Tinatin mainly produces cheese and yogurt. The family's total average monthly income is 100 laris. They live below the poverty line and according to Credo estimations belong to the \"vulnerable poor\" category. \r\n\r\nTinatin requested credit for start-up of a pig farm. Her loan request was approved in the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. With the received credit Tinatin will purchase 10 piglets. She will feed them for 8-9 months and sell most of the grown pigs for a higher price. She won\u2019t sell all of the pigs, but will keep two pigs, which will provide on average 20 piglets per year. Tinatin and Vazha will sell piglets, mainly in their and nearby villages. As a result of the new business initiative, the income of the family will significantly increase and they will be able to combat their poverty. In addition, the Kiva start-up loan will allow the family to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market in the future, in case of

This is her story: \r\n\r\nMy name is Olivia. I am 18 years old. My parents are unemployed while four of my brothers who are working are casual laborers with unstable financial status. In secondary school, I was the Head girl in both schools and while in High School, I was the Chair lady of the Wildlife Club, a member of the science congress club where I proceeded to the nationals twice and also a member of the Young Farmers Club.\r\n\r\nI chose Strathmore University because it is one of the best universities in the country and therefore Strathmore graduates stand among the finest. It has outstanding performance in both curriculum and co-curriculum activities. \r\n\r\nI am requesting the loan to pay my tuition fees. This is because my parents are unable to pay my tuition fees. My high school education was sponsored by ACTS, an organization that assists children to attend school. At that time, my brothers were struggling to pay fees for my two sisters, my twin sister in high school and the other in Mombasa Polytechnic University College. Until today, my brothers are struggling to finish the fees arrears at the college. I wish to have smooth learning with no interruptions hence, I have applied for the loan. I am looking forward to studying for my Bachelor of Commerce at Strathmore University.\r\n\r\nOn graduating, I wish to work with reputable and prestigious organizations, firms or institutions like the World Bank, UN, Price Waterhouse Cooper, East African Breweries Limited (EABL) and International Finance Cooperation. I will repay the loan while I am working, not long after my graduation. My hopes and dreams of the future are: to have a reputable company of my own, to give back to society by helping out in areas such as health and sanitation, environmental conservation and to assist in children's welfare in areas such as education, health and  care. My hobbies are singing, traveling and playing basketball. \r\n

is a prospective student applying for a loan to start his undergraduate work on a Bachelor of Business Science degree in Actuarial Science at Strathmore University and this is his story: \r\n\r\nI live in a humble estate in the city of Nairobi, Kenya. I am a partial-orphan. My father died when I was 7 years old. My family consists of my mother, my elder sister and I. I am an ambitious young man who does not allow setbacks to stop me from dreaming big. I have consistently maintained excellent academic grades since my primary school where I scored top marks which gained me a scholarship at a top National school. I have completed my secondary education at the school and attained excellent KCSE results.\r\n\r\nMy next plan is to earn the best degree from a prestigious university; Strathmore is my university of choice because it is the top ranked university in my country and a leader in the field of Business degrees. I have been admitted to start my first year of study in BBS - Actuarial Science at the school of Finance and Applied Economics.  The university emphasizes high standards of quality, excellence, respect, ethical conduct and service, besides liaising with industries and experts for the advancement of students. These excellent programs will equip me with experience and prepare me adequately for my research work.\r\n\r\nI need this loan because I would like to graduate with a well-recognized degree from the best university which will get me a fulfilling and a high paying career. I do not have any other source of funds to finance my education at Strathmore University. My mother who is the only surviving parent is unemployed.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation, I plan to become one the best qualified actuaries, work for the best institutions in the Industry, clear my loans as early as possible, improve the living condition of my family and become one of the best CEOs of our time. As part of giving back to my society, I plan to found an organization through which bright needy youth will be sponsored to access education. Through this KIVA loan, I will be able to realize my dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":15450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10688.25,"image":{"id":1107495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

is 38 years old. He is married and lives with his family: his wife \u2013 Natia, his 8-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son; the children go to school. The only source of the income for the family is a milk cow. The family consumes about half of the dairy products and the rest is sold in the village. Natia mainly produces cheese for sale. The total average monthly income of the family is 100 laris. They live below the poverty line and according to Credo estimations belong to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nDavid requested credit for start-up of a small business. A Kiva start-up loan was the only chance for him to get funds for financing the business venture. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of extremely low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit David will purchase a truck. He will collect firewood in the forest and sell it in his and nearby villages. The villagers use it for heating their house during winter, as well as spring and fall months. According to David\u2019s estimations the profit gained from this activity will equal on average 200 laris per month. The business will have a seasonal character and the income will reach its maximum in winter months. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the new business, initiated with the Kiva loan, the income of the family will significantly increase. David and Natia will use increased income for providing better living conditions for their children. In addition to the above-mentioned, the Kiva start-up loan will allow the family to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market in the future, in case of

is a prospective student applying for a loan to start her undergraduate work on a Bachelor of Science in Informatics degree at Strathmore University. This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Lilian and I am 17 years old. I come from a single-parented family of three kids. I have two siblings: a brother and a sister.\r\n\r\nI chose Strathmore University for several reasons. First it is the best university that offers the course I want to pursue, secondly Strathmore has the best facilities and a conducive environment for studying. Such facilities include: the well-equipped library, the student centre and to top it all off, it has the best lecturers in the country. I also chose Strathmore because of its sporting activities. Most of its teams are not only recognised in the country but also in the whole of the African continent, therefore I can join one of the teams which will improve my CV and at the same time help me discover and explore my talent in the sporting sector. \r\n\r\nStrathmore Students are also very disciplined and hence their studies are not always disrupted by strikes or riots as is the case in many public universities in Kenya. Lastly I decided to choose Stathmore because of their mentorship program which helps guide the students in the right path and to make the right decisions in life since the mentors are people who have experience and they know how to deal with certain situations in life.\r\n\r\nI want to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Informatics as my undergraduate programme. I need the loan to finance my education at the university  since my mother cannot afford the fees required for the course. After graduating I would like to be employed for a few years until I have saved enough money to start my own IT company or become an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nI hope I will be able to do the course and afterwards establish my own business or company and create jobs. I also hope that I will be able to achieve all the goals I have set  in life. I would also like to thank Strathmore for giving needy but bright kids an option of still pursuing their studies, with no worries, by partnering with KIVA, and I am grateful for being accorded this chance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":15425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":170.49,"image":{"id":1104094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

are Hilmelda, Leticia, Maria, Emilia, Maria and Herminia. They all have various activities: selling chicken tamales and making napkins. Leticia is a humble and hardworking person; she has been making embroideries such as napkins and tablecloths for three years. What she likes most about her business is to welcome customers and have their orders ready on time, since her customers order napkins. She also sells various flavours of tamales: chicken, pork rib, sweetcorn jam. She makes them every three days. She says that it takes her one month to weave a tablecloth and fifteen days for a napkin. She embroiders three times a day because she has a bad back. What she likes best about this part of the business is that her mother and sisters practice the same craft. Her mother taught her when she was little and Leticia has always liked embroidery. It is the most important thing she inherited from her mother. She is very proud of her business because it is quite profitable and allows her to work doing what she loves; she works with love and dedication. One of Leticia's dreams is to see her work acknowledged and to be able to show how she makes napkins and tablecloths on her backstrap loom, which is the implement she uses the most to make her napkins. She asks for the loan in order to buy more thread, ribbons, yarn and colour thread. The members of the group thank Foundation Realidad for the help it extends to indigenous people and to people of marginalised villages.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":1087491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy supplies for embroidery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santiago Jamiltepec Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-30T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-29T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":3175,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilmelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1587.5,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":22118.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419052,"comment":null},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":11059.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568627,"comment":null},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11059.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399916,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-31T17:38:43Z","paid_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":430050,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia se sigue dedicando al negocio de taller de carpinteria junto con su esposo,ella realiza trabajos de madera como mesas,sillas y puertas,la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 7:00 p.m,por medio de este negocio la socia saca adelante a sus hijos,el sue\u00f1o de la socia es ampliar el negocio de taller de carpinteria.La socia solicita le credito para comprar herramientas y madera.\n\nLa socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.\n\n","en":"The member continues working in her carpentry workshop along with her husband.

Her business was born when she came from the municipality of Malambo to the city of Barranquilla.  She was gradually making progress attracting customers, mainly in the casinos located on a commercial corridor on one of the main interdepartmental routes.  Now she is applying for her first loan, because she needs to grow and to do that she needs to find suppliers from whom she can buy in volume and on a cash basis, as they offer a better price.  This is the reason for this Kiva loan, the first loan that she has taken from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use this loan to buy raw materials, such as cooking oil, cereals and tubers.

He is very friendly, and above all hard-working. From a young age his parents taught him to earn his daily bread with the sweat of his brow, as they didn't have many financial resources. For this reason he could only go to school as far as the primary level, but would have liked to have finished school.\r\n\r\nHe is the father of three children whom he loves very much. Although they are adults, he is always attentive to them, especially to instill in them good habits. He tells us it is better to be humble but honest.\r\n\r\nHis home is located in Nazca, a city noted for having a year-round warm climate. Here we also find the Nazca lines, which are geoglyphs located in the middle of an extensive arid plain, that were used by the ancient Nazca culture as a kind of astronomic calendar for the rainy season. \r\n\r\nWhen Valentin has spare time, he likes to read and also ask his wife to prepare one of her dishes, the very delicious \u201cAdobo\u201d (pork in a spicy sauce).\r\n\r\nValentin works on his crop field with a great deal of enthusiasm. Currently, he has planted butter beans. He works on his planting around eight hours daily, as is always aware of how the crop is growing, and especially whether it has some pest infestation. He believes that things are going well in his business because he is very careful and has already been working several years in it.\r\n\r\nValentin is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to the help they have provided him, he will be able to buy organic and other fertilizers for maintaining his crop, especially to avoid his crop being infested with pests. This way he will be able to take good care of his crop, and especially to obtain a good harvest. This way he will be able to continue working, in order to make his greatest dream a reality: \"To have more crop fields in order to have more plantings\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1103296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer and herbicides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T05:30:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":126.11,"local_amount":328.98,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":337.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222550,"comment":null},{"amount":448.89,"local_amount":1171.02,"processed_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954342,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T21:25:39Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":430500,"name":"Perfecta Natividad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Perfecta es una mujer de 24 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Ica, es casada y tiene 2 peque\u00f1os hijos los cuales cursan la educaci\u00f3n inicial, en sus ratos libres le gusta cocinar su comida favorita el \u201cArroz con Pollo\u201d; Perfecta con mucho empe\u00f1o concluy\u00f3 sus estudios secundarios, lamentablemente por falta de recursos no puedo cursar una carrera universitaria, pero hubiera gustado poder estudiar la carrera de Enfermer\u00eda.\nPor iniciativa propia, desde hace varios a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de deliciosos postres, como son los alfajores y las cocadas, ella dedica a si negocio un aproximado de 7 horas diarias, en las cuales puede atender entre 80 y 110 clientes; ella cree que su negocio marcha bien gracias a sus delicias, experiencia y buena ubicaci\u00f3n ya que trabaja en el centro de la ciudad.\nPerfecta se encuentra muy agradecida con los prestatarios Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada, podr\u00e1 realizar el mejoramiento de su vivienda, ya que se acerca la \u00e9poca de invierno y desear\u00eda poder construir un cuarto adicional para sus peque\u00f1os hijos; de esta manera podr\u00e1 cumplir su gran sue\u00f1o de llegar a construir su vivienda con las comodidades que requieran para mejorar la calidad de vida de ella y su familia. \n","en":"Perfecta is a 24 year old woman, she lives in the city of Ica, she is married and has 2 small children who are in primary school and in her free time she enjoys cooking her favorite food, chicken with rice.

Only the youngest of her children, who is 16 and a secondary school student, remains under her care. \r\n\r\n\r\nCarolina started her business selling plastic products and cosmetics with the support of her husband. After working some time with her, her husband decided to travel abroad to look for better job opportunities. Carolina was left in charge of the business, and tries to run it herself as she receives support from nobody.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe has other income in the form of the money which her husband sends to her, which he earns with the hard work he carries out abroad. Carolina sells her products in the areas surrounding Granada.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarolina has requested a Kiva loan to buy merchandise such as plastic bags and cosmetics. This will help her a lot as she will be able to increase her stock and improve her sales, particularly around this period, which is Mother\u2019s Day. In the future she plans to improve the security of her business infrastructure, and her next goal is to work hard to improve her living conditions and realize her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1103321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy merchandise such as plastic bags and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina De Los Angeles \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":727,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":432542,"name":"Mamerta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Mamerta, age 74, who is a resident of Taguig City in the Philippines.

is Nenita, 53, a resident of Taguig City, Philippines. She is married to Gil, a driver, and she is a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNenita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 (Philippine pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNenita hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1108049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nenita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":8750,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8924.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359404,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6374.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303219,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5099.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355943,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5099.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114059,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5099.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350151,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T04:25:55Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:18:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":432647,"name":"Fatou Sabibou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"CE MEMBRE HABITE DANS LE M\u00caME VILLAGE QUE LES AUTRES MEMBRES DU BANC VILLAGEOIS CR\u00c9E LE 06 JUIN 2001.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nFlocerfida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Flocerfida is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFlocerfida hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk and Marikina Shoe Exchange.  A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers depend on for their income. Luisa's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 3000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nLuisa dreams of expanding her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRahiema hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He has been doing this job since 2007. He lives with his wife and his four children in his small old house, which is in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. \r\n\r\nHe bought his plot of the land and house in 2007 and he never made any repairs or renovation to his house. He decided to make repairs to his old house. At first, he planned to insulate the walls of his house because it becomes very cold inside the house without the wall insulation, and it costs too much money for the smoky coal to get the inside of the house warm. Also, it is the worst influence on the air of the city. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters, where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Mr. Munkhbayar is taking will used to buy the building materials to make repairs and to insulate the walls of his house to reduce heat loss and emissions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1174.95,"image":{"id":1108065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

With everything she learned, she started her own business venture.  At first she sold beautiful Christmas decorations, and then kitchen and bathroom linens, and finally T-shirts for the Carnival festivities around the city.  The last venture became her specialty and is how she attracted her best customers.  Her sales from these ventures are conducted in the surrounding areas of her neighborhood according to each season.  She orders products that are adapted to the needs associated with a particular season.  These businesses have enabled her to contribute toward the expenses of her family, which consists of her husband and two children (ages 10 and 16).  Ibeth helps pay for improvements around her home and for her daughter's studies.  Her primary goal is to keep her children healthy, but she also has dreams of prosperity in the form of growing and stabilizing her business.  She hopes to continue generating income according to plan.  Everything she aspires for is thought of with her family in mind.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest challenge is not having sufficient capital to continue the growth of her business.  For this reason, Ibeth is applying for a Kiva loan so that she can invest in the purchase of materials and supplies such as padding, fabrics, lace, thread, and buttons.  She plans to produce a large number of products and increase her sales.  By taking advantage of the second half of the year, Ibeth sees potential for growing each of her businesses.  The control over what her customers can buy rests in her hands, based on the supplies, labor, discounts, and other factors.

Ciudad de Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca, una comunidad rica en gastronom\u00eda uno de sus platillos es el caldo de iguana y tacos de chicatana (hormiga roja). \nTodas las integrantes de este grupo trabajan en la central camionera de su comunidad desde hace diez a\u00f1os, que fue cuando se fundo la central.\nLa representante de este grupo es la se\u00f1ora Elena de treinta y seis a\u00f1os de edad, quien se dedica a la venta de  antojitos mexicanos como enchiladas, quesadillas, pizzas y tortas.\nDice que lleva vendiendo trece a\u00f1os, y que anteriormente vend\u00eda sus antojitos mexicanos en las calles de su comunidad.\nUna de las razones por las cuales decidi\u00f3 vender comida es por que no estudi\u00f3 y no encontraba trabajo, pero necesitaba darles de comer a sus hijos ya que es madre soltera; tiene tres hijos Miguel, Rub\u00ed y Gabriel quienes les ayudan saliendo de la escuela, mientras ella esta en el puesto, ellos van a ofrecerle comida a los choferes y a los pasajeros. \nA las siete de la tarde, ya cuando es el \u00faltimo recorrido de las camionetas y se cierra la central sus hijos y do\u00f1a Elena recogen lo que utilizaron y dejan limpio para que al d\u00eda siguiente vuelva otra vez a vender y sus clientes encuentren el local limpio.\nUna de las cosas que la hacen sentir bien es la ayuda que le ha dado fundacion, ya que va a poder comprar m\u00e1s ingredientes para la elaboraci\u00f3n de antojitos mexicanos.\n\nLas otras integrantes del grupo son:\n\nMaria Guadalupe- quien se dedica a la venta de comida.\nGloria Itzayana-quien se dedica a la venta de comida.\nReynalda-quien se dedica a la venta de comida.\nMartha Ang\u00e9lica-quien se dedica a la venta de comida.\n\nLe dan las gracias a fundacion por ayudar a todas las mujeres.\n\n***Esta foto se tom\u00f3 en una central camionera, donde siempre hay mucha gente en los comercios, es por eso que se puede ver a m\u00e1s personas cerca de las integrantes del grupo.

One of the traditional dishes is an iguana stew, and another is chicatana tacos (red ant tacos). \r\n\r\nAll the members of the group have worked at the central bus station in their community for over ten years, since the creation of the station. Elena is the representative of this group. She is 36 years old, and makes a living selling traditional Mexican foods, such as enchiladas, quesadillas, pizzas and tortas. She has been selling food for 13 years, and before she began working in the bus station, she sold food in the streets of her community. \r\n\r\nOne of her reasons for starting her food sales business was her lack of education and therefore her inability to find work. She was a single mother who needed a way to feed her three kids, Miguel, Rub\u00ed and Gabriel. Her children help her make and sell food when they finish school in the afternoon, and they offer food items to the drivers and passengers who pass through the terminal. \r\n\r\nAt seven in the evening, when the vans and buses make their final trips and the station closes, Elena and her children clean their food stand and the surrounding area, so that the next day their customers will find the place clean and orderly. Elena is grateful for the support she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad (Reality Foundation), and she plans to utilize the support from the loan to purchase ingredients for making traditional Mexican food dishes.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe \u2013 food sales\r\nGloria Itzayana \u2013 food sales\r\nReynalda \u2013 food sales\r\nMartha Ang\u00e9lica \u2013 food sales\r\n\r\nThe groups members are thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for their support.\r\n\r\n***This photo was taken at the bus terminal, where there are always many people buying and selling various goods, and those people appear in the background of the group photo. However, the group members are the only people who are looking at the camera (except for the girl who drinking juice; she is Maria Guadalupe\u2019s daughter. Maria Guadalupe is the woman at the far right in the photo).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1102409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients for making food items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Itzayana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reynalda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Ang\u00e9lica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6895.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7272.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7572.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7933.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8325.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.47},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":521.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":543},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":597.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":494.47,"local_amount":6895.33,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6936.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419053,"comment":null},{"amount":521.53,"local_amount":7272.69,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7316.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568628,"comment":null},{"amount":119.25,"local_amount":1662.92,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399917,"comment":null},{"amount":501.56,"local_amount":6994.2,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7036.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407591,"comment":null},{"amount":949.24,"local_amount":13237.07,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":13316.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392102,"comment":null},{"amount":138.95,"local_amount":1937.79,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1949.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120145,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-21T20:01:13Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":431793,"name":"Carolina","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" \nNasceu na provincial de Inhambane, fez a 7\u00aa classe, solteira de 42 anos vive na casa pr\u00f3pria com sua fam\u00edlia e responsabiliza se pela sobrinha que vive com ela em sua casa. \nTrabalha no Centro Social da EDM a mais de 10 anos como auxiliar, trabalha das 7h as 17h tendo um salario que aplica nas despesas da casa e da sua obra, para al\u00e9m do trabalho tem tido horas extras que aplicara tamb\u00e9m no reembolso do empr\u00e9stimo na tentativa de terminar mais r\u00e1pido para aceder a outro.\nEste \u00e9 seu primeiro empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuvku no valor de 15.000.00mt com o qual pretende comprar material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o nomeadamente: (cimento, blocos e areia) para fazer o reboco na sua sala de estar.

All of them engage in some type of business activity.  They are all hardworking and responsible.  The members say that they are very pleased because the town of San Felipe is close to celebrating Mother's Day.  They say that the name of their group was chosen simply because it came as an idea to one of the members, whose name is not listed because that person is no longer with the group.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Saturnina is a member of this group.  She says that she is 47 years old and lives in the town of San Felipe.  Saturnina is a married woman who has been with her husband Victorino for 31 years.  He works on a construction site.  They have a family with children, but only one is a dependent even though the child is no longer in school.  Do\u00f1a Saturnina has been selling all types of clothing for five years, including trousers and shirts.  She conducts her sales by walking around the town of San Felipe and visiting her neighbors.  \"I started this business because I wanted to help my husband with the household expenses and because I enjoy walking,\" she says.  However, her greatest difficulty at the moment is having to do a great deal of walking under the sun or when it rains.  This time she is requesting a loan so that she can restock with more clothing.  She says that the loan will help her obtain more merchandise and increase her earnings considerably.  Now she will be able to buy clothes that are in style.  Her profits will help cover expenses such as food, shoes, clothing, and other needs.

El nombre del grupo lo eligieron las integrantes del grupo y lo eligieron ya que donde viene se llama as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n porque el lugar donde viven hay una capilla que tambi\u00e9n se llama El Calvario es donde se celebra la crucifixi\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas en Semana Santa.\n\nDo\u00f1a Elia quien es la representante del grupo nos cuenta que tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or  Juan desde hace 29 a\u00f1os de edad juntos formaron una familia con hijos e hijas pero hasta el momento ya solo tiene  un joven que ya no estudia pero aun depende de dicha pareja. Do\u00f1a Elia tiene una tortiller\u00eda y una tienda de abarrotes, su tortiller\u00eda tiene un a\u00f1o que la inicio no tiene ning\u00fan nombre nos cuenta que la dificultad que presenta con frecuencia es para comprar ma\u00edz, gas y le\u00f1a ya que est\u00e1 muy caro ya que siempre ha comprado esto  porque esto es lo fundamental para que su tortiller\u00eda siga funcionando algo  curioso que nos cuenta es que su mama fue quien le ense\u00f1o hacer tortillas tambi\u00e9n aprendi\u00f3 hacer el nixtamal para las tortillas es por eso que Su tienda tiene ya tiene 6 a\u00f1os nos comenta que la inicio ya que su esposo la apoyo mucho y la motivo para que juntos iniciaran su negocio solo que ahora su dificultad es la competencia que tiene pero no se desanima todo lo contrario fue cuando decidi\u00f3 iniciar su tortiller\u00eda. \nEsta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar ma\u00edz, gas, le\u00f1a y dulces para surtir su tienda de abarrotes nos cometa que el cr\u00e9dito le ayuda de mucho ya que cuando llega su cr\u00e9dito aprovecha para surtirse y no estar comprado cada semana.

The group meets on a hill where one can enjoy the sun in the afternoons.  The group name was chosen by the members because where they live there is a chapel that is also named El Calvario and its there that the crucifixion of Jesus is honored during Holy Week.\r\nDo\u00f1a Elia, who is the representative of the group, is 50 years old, married to Mr. Juan since she was 29 years old and together they have a family of daughters and sons.  Currently they have only one child that is no longer in school but still depends on them.  Do\u00f1a Elia has a tortilleria and a grocery store.  She started the tortilleria a year ago and it has no name.  She frequently has difficulties buying corn meal, gas and firewood because of the high prices.  These are essential items for the running of her tortilla making business.  She tells us that it was her mother that taught her how to make tortillas.  She also learned how to make the cooked maize for the tortillas.  Her store has been operating for 6 years.  She started it with her husband, who gave her a lot of support and encouraged her to open the business.  She currently has some competition but she is not discouraged by it, on the contrary, it has supported her decision to open the tortilleria.\r\nAt this time she is requesting a loan to buy maize, gas, firewood and sweets to supply her grocery store.  She comments that the loan helps her a lot since when she receives it she can stock up and does not need to purchase items every week.  Her goal is to continue to grow her two businesses, especially the store as she plans to leave it to one of her daughters so that she can have financial security.  \r\nShe uses her income to buy food, shoes and cover some household expenses.  This is of great help to her husband because they do not have to worry as much when he does not have work.\r\nDo\u00f1a Elia and the group are very grateful for the chance to invest the loan into their businesses.  Luisa,  Margarita, Petra, and Mar\u00eda Guadalupe will buy sheep to raise and fatten up for later resale; Do\u00f1a Enriqueta will buy turkeys to also fatten up and resell;  whereas Cristal will invest in perfumes, hardware and bedspreads.  Finally, Mar\u00eda Elena will buy popsicles and Alberta will purchase clothing for men and women to later sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":1103151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy maize, gas, firewood, sweets, beverages, bread, milk, eggs and canned goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Calvario, San Felipe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T18:00:04Z","loan_amount":5575,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Cristal ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enriqueta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elia Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":78000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":5575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":9750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2090.63,"local_amount":29250,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":29329.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419057,"comment":null},{"amount":2090.62,"local_amount":29250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":29329.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568632,"comment":null},{"amount":1393.75,"local_amount":19500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":19552.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399921,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-07T16:48:32Z","paid_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":430890,"name":"Triunfadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cTriunfadoras\u201d es la primera vez que est\u00e1 trabajando con la instituci\u00f3n sin embargo la vez que visitamos a las integrantes estaban muy contentas porque supieron que iban estar en una foto como grupo.

She dresses the pork rinds with vegetables such as tomatoes and lettuce, mayonnaise, and shredded cheese. To the corn on the cob she adds mayonnaise, shredded cheese, and piquin chili pepper. She dresses the toasted corn kernels with mayonnaise, chunks of chickens, epazote herb, and piquin chili pepper.\r\n\r\nRosa is requesting this loan in order to purchase everything she needs such as corn, pork rinds, mayonnaise, shredded cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, cups, spoons, etc. \r\n\r\nShe has been working in this activity for 3 years. Rosa started the business after one occasion when she accompanied her mother-in-law in selling her Mexican snacks, and when Rosa saw how well her mother-in-law sold the snacks she decided that she herself would begin to sell as well. \r\n\r\nRosa sells every afternoon; she begins preparing the snacks at noon so that they are ready for the afternoon. She carries all of her supplies on her very helpful donkey. On the weekends her husband helps her; they are the busiest days because in general families get together and purchase more. \r\n\r\nThe only difficulty Rosa faces is the purchase of gas because the gas is very expensive and the price rises every time. However, she keeps her spirits up because when she cannot buy gas she uses the firewood that is cut in her community. She also loves to sell because she can chat with all of her neighbors during the afternoons. But more than anything, her earnings help her family a lot because she can buy clothing and can save up for building her own house. Her goal is for her family to live independently, since right now they live with her parents-in-law. \r\n\r\nRosa and the other group members are very grateful for the opportunity that Kiva offers them because it will help them greatly in their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1103180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase mayonnaise, pork rinds, piquin chili peppers, avocados, tomatoes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel Agua Bendita.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T18:00:05Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eusebia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":10500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10521.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419058,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7014.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568633,"comment":null},{"amount":478.81,"local_amount":6703.36,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6717.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399922,"comment":null},{"amount":271.19,"local_amount":3796.64,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3804.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407593,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T06:59:56Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":430913,"name":"Ascencion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ascensi\u00f3n, habita en la comarca Cusirisne en las afueras Teustepe, donde la agricultura y la crianza de Ganado forman parte de las actividades diarias de la gente que ah\u00ed vive.

In this community the biggest celebrations are on 31 December and 1 January, when they celebrate the arrival of the new year.\r\n\r\nThe group is made up of very happy people who are grateful to the institution.  They are eight women and one man.  All of them have requested the loan to use in their businesses.  Irene will invest in her merchandise and Mar\u00eda Juana in a grocery store.  Ces\u00e1rea will buy lambs.  Josefina will invest in taxi repairs for her husband.  Eulalia will buy plastic goods to sell.  Modesta will buy scouring pads (cleaning products) to sell.  Mar\u00eda Josefina will invest in costume jewelry and Leonardo in groceries, seeds, fruits, and vegetables.\r\n\r\nCesaria, who is the representative of the group, is 54 years old and has been married to Demetrio for 30 years.  They had a family together but at the moment no longer have dependents, although they are supporting a grandson in his studies, Yosmar, who is in fourth grade.\r\n\r\nCesaria has had a grocery store for 20 years.  Up to now it has not had a name, but she is thinking about giving it one.  Cesaria says she began selling candy in her house and later thought about opening her grocery store.  The difficulty that comes up is the competition in the area where she lives.  She does not get discouraged, though, because new stores are constantly opening but later end up closing.\r\n\r\nCesaria has been working with the institution for a long time now.  This time she requested the loan to supply her grocery store; she will buy candy, soap, milk, eggs, bread, etc.\r\n\r\nThe loan has helped her a lot because she can buy enough merchandise for two or three months.  She is very grateful because her quality of life has improved with her profits, and this was one of her goals.  She invests her profits in the household expenses and on her grandson's education, among other things.\r\n\r\nShe and the group in general are very grateful for the loan granted because it will be very helpful to invest in their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7150,"image":{"id":1103270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy canned goods, milk, bread, eggs, soda, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Pedro El Alto","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":7150,"lender_count":197,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonardo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ces\u00e1rea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":7150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2681.25,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":37614.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419059,"comment":null},{"amount":2681.25,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":37614.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568634,"comment":null},{"amount":1787.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25076.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399923,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-08T20:28:57Z","paid_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":430975,"name":"Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santos es un joven con muchos deseos de superaci\u00f3n , es agricultor, muy  trabajador y vive en una comunidad  situada en  la zona Sur de Costa Rica, ubicada en Concepci\u00f3n de Pilas, Puntarenas, llamada La Danta.

He couldn\u2019t get credit from financial institutions because of his poverty and lack of business experience. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d due to their low-income status. With the received credit, Yuri will purchase a cow. Rita will produce cheese, and Yuri\u2019s mother will sell it on the local open market. The income of the family will double, and Yuri will be able to provide better living conditions for his little daughter.

Irakli stopped working 6 months ago, as he didn\u2019t have money to purchase the wooden materials for production. He couldn\u2019t get credit from local finance institutions, because of the family\u2019s low income. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Irakli will purchase materials for the workshop. He will re-start production of chairs and sell them through networks that he already knows; mainly in furniture stores in nearby towns. The income of the family will increase by approximately 110% and they will be able to improve their living conditions. Irakli also plans to reinvest part of the profit in the workshop, so he can diversify the products he makes.

In the photo she is seen in the box at the upper left. She works in the woven handicraft sector and has run her business for seven years. She works Mondays to Friday. She is the one who sometimes goes to visit her customers' homes.\r\n\r\nShe buys the merchandise she needs in the city of Concepci\u00f3n, and other times in the city of Puerto Montt. With the loan she will buy wool. Her business goals are to have her own shop for better serving her clientele.\r\n\r\nKatty lives with her husband and her four children, and one of her dreams is to fulfill herself as a woman and to give her children a very good education.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has offered her, as it has allowed her to invest in her business. As well, she feels very comfortable in the company of the other entrepreneurs in the communal bank group, as they share various activities and interests. It has also served as an enjoyable activity for her. With the training provided in the meetings she has learned to run her business better.\r\n\r\nChiguayante is a commune located in the south of Chile, near the city of Concepci\u00f3n, in Biob\u00edo region. Its name comes from mapudungun (mapuche language) and means \u201csun through mist\". Due to its mountainous surroundings it has a temperate maritime climate. Its economic activity is mainly commercial.\r\n\r\nChiguayante had been created as a commune in 1925, but for various reasons it later joined with Concepci\u00f3n. Its existence in that period lasted less than two years. In 1996 it was again created as a commune, and remains so to the present day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6725,"image":{"id":1104232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Concepci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":6725,"lender_count":219,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Honoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":3406814,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":394187},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":406353},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":414109},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":422011},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":430067},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":438278},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":446644},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":455165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":802.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":817.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":848.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":865.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":881.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":898.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3230.74,"local_amount":1636660,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1638309.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430185,"comment":null},{"amount":1714.1,"local_amount":868345,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":869220.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332959,"comment":null},{"amount":1780.16,"local_amount":901809,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":902717.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301878980,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-04T07:38:34Z","paid_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":432747,"name":"Romeo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Romeo lives in the village of Lapankuri, Kakheti Region. He is fifty-seven years old, single, and lives alone. Romeo works as a watchman in a local private dairy farm. His monthly salary is 100 Laris. Romeo owns 0.6 hectares of land, where he grows maize. In the spring and summer months he works hard on his cornfield during daytime and in the evening he goes to the farm, where he stays till morning. According the Credo estimations he belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nRomeo needs money to purchase fertilizers for the cornfield. He tilled the land in April and sowed maize. If he doesn\u2019t use fertilizers, he will get a low quality harvest and will have to sell it for cheap price, which won\u2019t bring any profit. Romeo will also use some part of the credit to purchase piglets to set-up a small pig farm. He wasn\u2019t able to receive the requested loan from local financial institutions, because his income was too small to qualify for regular loan products. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Romeo will purchase fertilizers and use them in the cornfield. He will work hard on the plot during the summer to get good harvest. After selling the harvest, Romeo will get profit. Also his piglets will grow and in 7-8 months he will already have 2 pigs, which will give him approximately 18 piglets per year for sale. Romeo will have his own business and his monthly income will significantly improve. The Kiva start-up loan will allow him to improve his living conditions.

He couldn\u2019t get regular agricultural credit from local financial institutions as the income of the family is too small. Tamaz\u2019s loan request was approved because of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received loan, Tamaz will purchase fertilizers, till the land, fertilize it and sow maize. He will work hard on the plot during the summer to get a good harvest. After selling the harvest, he will get profit. With part of the credit, Tamaz will also purchase a pig for setting up a pig farm. He will be able to sell piglets after four months. Through the above mentioned investment Tamaz\u2019s income will increase and he will be able to improve the living conditions of the family.

He learned this trade from his mother, who is also a merchant.  He has a business selling cold cuts and also selling low cost novelty items, including flashlights, cell phone cases, cellular phones, etc.  He buys his cold cuts in the municipality of Galapa, where he lives with his wife and their two children aged 4 and 2 months.  He acquires his merchandise in the city of Barranquilla, located 20 minutes from his city.  Most of his customers are found in the municipalities of Sabanalarga, Las Pe\u00f1as, Aguada, San Pablo, and also in Galapa.  He sells on credit, and his customers pay over a period of between 15-30 days.  With the income that comes from his sales, he supports his household.  For this reason, he wants to grow his business so that he can provide his family with greater comfort, and can strengthen his family's future.  For the future, his goal is to have his own house, where he could locate his expanded business.  His main challenge is having enough working capital to buy and take advantage of special pricing.  This is why he is applying for a Kiva loan.  He will use this loan to buy cold cuts and novelty products.

Now that he owns his own business, he has started attending evening classes so that he can get his high school diploma and set a good example for his son.\r\n\r\nHe has lived in the town of Kalabo all his life. He says he is happy to finally be able to offer his hometown a way of sending and receiving money that is easy, safe and affordable. When asked what challenges he faces in his business, he points to the fact that he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers. He goes on to explain that this is especially a challenge for him because his hometown of Kalabo has no banking services, and so when he runs out of cash, he has no choice but to electronically send all his working capital to a nearby town called Mongu, and have someone send some cash to him via a speed boat. This can take about two hours and he is charged a fee of K 50,000 (about $10). This is money that is meant to be his profit. He fears that should it happen that a boat capsizes, he would lose all his working capital.\r\n\r\nMuyoyeta is hopeful that once he gets his Kiva loan, he will be able to serve more customers without the risk of losing all his money and earn more profits to help him finish his education and give a better life to his young family.\r\n\r\nIn the video, Muyoyeta is being interviewed by a

They live in a small and very peaceful area where the people earn their living growing corn. The group's members tell the story that they chose the name because they got it from the Bible. They are not entirely sure what it means, but they like it. It has to do with an evangelical name and the members believe it was a person who organized musicians. They tell us that the place where they live, San Agust\u00edn Mextepec, celebrates the day the evangelist came to the place. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Agustina, who is one of the group's representatives, says that she is 54 years old and has been married for forty years to Juan who works in the countryside although he is also a merchant. Do\u00f1a Agustina earns a living selling household products and mentions that she began by selling from neighborhood to neighborhood, carrying the products in her arms, but now her situation has changed since she has some very well-established stands. Do\u00f1a Agustina has requested the loan in order to purchase more merchandise such as blender jars, knives, scissors, clotheslines, gloves, buckets, brushes, etc. \r\n\r\nAgustina comments that the difficulty that presents itself is when the delegates, or leaders of the plaza, don't allow her to sell as she wishes since if one doesn't sell for two or three days they may take one's spot away. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Agustina would like her two daughters, although they are still in school, to practice the profession they like the most. For example, her daughter Diana would like to be a nurse or doctor, and her other daughter, Esmeralda, would like to be a teacher in order to instruct children. Agustina says that she will help them as much as she can. She also would like for the kitchen she hired someone to build to be finished soon so she may try it out for the first time. \r\n\r\nThe group's other members are: Raquel who will invest in blender jars, Maria Angelica who will invest in blender jars and bases, Felisa who will purchase canvas of various sizes and colors, Emma who will invest in sewing supplies and Norma in blender jars and sewing supplies. \r\n\r\nThey are all very grateful and happy to have received the loan. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":1105761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase blender jars, cutlery, clotheslines, cleaning clothes, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T02:30:03Z","loan_amount":4600,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":64000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1725,"local_amount":24000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":24087.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419066,"comment":null},{"amount":1150,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":16058.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568640,"comment":null},{"amount":1150,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16058.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399930,"comment":null},{"amount":575,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8029.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407597,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-17T23:34:00Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":431056,"name":"Raul Gerardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Raul de 39 a\u00f1os de edad esposo y padre, vive en casa propia y se esfuerza d\u00eda a d\u00eda para mantener a su peque\u00f1a y unida familia, mantener su hogar y mas que nada mantener la felicidad al lado de su familia, se dedica a la venta  de art\u00edculos varios de segunda mano tales como son televisores hornos de microondas, l\u00e1mparas, electrodom\u00e9sticos en general entre otros.

Therefore, he became a carpenter and opened a woodworking shop in his home a little more than seven years ago.  He believes that he earns more as a result of being his own boss.  Gregorio is pleased with what has transpired over the years and that his work attracts customers.  He produces all types of products made of wood (beds, chairs, wardrobes, doors, drawers, tables, windows, and armchairs).  Some people rave about his beautiful work.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan.
