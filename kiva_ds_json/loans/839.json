their lives and give their children a better future.  The members of this group are from a town called Agua de Ca\u00f1a.  Just before arriving at Agua de Ca\u00f1a there is a river that belongs to Pinotepa called R\u00edo de Arena that\u2019s closer to the community of Agua de Ca\u00f1a than it is to Pinotepa.  The town of Agua de Ca\u00f1a is very small but it\u2019s quite beautiful because there are many green trees, much water and very large trees called \u201cparotas;\u201d  it\u2019s very cool and there are many animals like pigs, dogs and little goats.  One of Agua de Ca\u00f1a\u2019s traditions is the \u201cMayordom\u00edas\u201d [series of religious festivities] and the town\u2019s festival that take place each May 3rd.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Porfiria, a very kind and cheerful, 49-year-old woman.  Porfiria has been selling perfume for five years and she tells us that what she likes best about her business is going out to sell house to house and chatting with her customers because while she\u2019s chatting away with one and another, they buy perfume.\r\n\r\nWhat she doesn\u2019t like about her business is that some of her customers take their time to pay her and this makes her sad because she can\u2019t earn her profits.  One of her challenges is that sometimes she does not have money to invest in the purchase of more merchandise that she sometimes runs out of quickly.\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to have a perfume shop in her community so that when her customers come by to buy they will feel comfortable and will be able to choose their perfumes.\r\n\r\nPorfiria is a widow and has five children who are married and are called: Daniel, Nayeli, Andrea, Yomara and Andr\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nPorfiria requested the loan to buy more perfumes to sell at retail.  She thanks the Fundaci\u00f3n for the opportunities it\u2019s given to improve their lives and have their own businesses. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nInocencia- sells shoes\r\nAlicia- sells chickens\r\nYolanda- sells traditional Mexican fast-food snacks\r\nTeresa- sells traditional Mexican fast-food snacks\r\nAndrea- sells fruit and vegetables\r\nMargarita- catalogue

life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6975,"image":{"id":1069743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

This way they will be able to give their children a better future. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are from Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca, land of progress and growth.  The traditions of Pinotepa are the patron saints and the \u201cFiesta Quinto Viernes\u201d better known as Holy Week.  The games come, and many foreigners come to sell their handicrafts.  There are many small businesses in the community, and they reflect their work.

Xochitl, as she is better known by her communal bank colleagues and friends, sells groceries like cookies, soft drinks, coffee, sugar, bread, beans, rice, oil, and chilies.  Xochitl tells us that she has a small place where she sells her merchandise and tends to her customers kindly and affectionately.  She always tries to have her store stocked so that her customers will find what they are looking for.\r\n\r\nXochitl tells us that what she likes the most about her business is having a store full of merchandise and waiting on her customers well.  What she does not like about her business is when she does not have enough money to buy more merchandise and her store is empty.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she is very happy because, thanks to God, she has been able to continue her business, and, therefore, she has been able to improve her quality of life.

What he likes best about farming corn is that most seasons he gets good harvests and this makes him feel successful because he can have more profits and more corn.\r\n\r\nBecause Don Ignacio is diversified in his businesses, this time he asked for the loan to use in his taxi service.  He will buy spare parts for the taxi.  However, the loan will have an impact on both businesses because he will use profits from his taxi to plant corn.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that he\u2019s very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for having opened doors to a new path to continue with his business and improve his and his community\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nJulia- sells meat\r\nLeticia- sells food\r\nGloria- pottery\r\nTomasa Dominga \u2013 sells cheese\r\n\r\nThey thank the Fundaci\u00f3n for giving them the opportunity to stay in business to thus improve their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1069760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy spare parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san juan bautista lo de soto,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-24T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-24T17:20:04Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Letcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacio German","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8225.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8549.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9001.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":9387.72},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9836.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":626.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":685.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":714.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":748.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":626.06,"local_amount":8225.63,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8272.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317536,"comment":null},{"amount":650.69,"local_amount":8549.25,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8597.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418921,"comment":null},{"amount":685.1,"local_amount":9001.19,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9052.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568497,"comment":null},{"amount":714.51,"local_amount":9387.72,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-27T08:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9441.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399807,"comment":null},{"amount":748.64,"local_amount":9836.21,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9892.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407540,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-24T17:13:59Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":415567,"name":"Las Rebeldes Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo Las Rebeldes esta formado por 12 mujeres alegres, amabres y trabajadoras, cada una de ellas tiene una actividad economica: Teresa venta de antojitos, Petra cria de cerdos, Irene venta de calzado, Guadalupe venta de antojitos, Olivia venta de carne, Maria Isabel reposteria, Araceli frutas y legumbres, Clara Maria reposteria, Teresa venta de ropa, Filomena venta de antojitos, Laura venta de antojitos, Maria Leonor joyeria.\nEste grupo esta ubicado en una zona ca\u00f1era y la mayoria de sus habitantes se dedica a la siembra y cultivo de ca\u00f1a.\n\nDo\u00f1a Petra tiene la edad de 38 a\u00f1os, solo estudio la secundaria y esta casada con don clemente con el cual tiene dos hijos, Ella platica que siempre le ha gustado trabajar ya que desde muy chica sus padres le ense\u00f1aron a  trabajar para salir adelante, Do\u00f1a Petra dice que hace mas de 19 a\u00f1os inicio a criar cerdos para su posterior venta con la intencion de ganar un poco de dinero extra y ayudar con los gastos del hogar.\n\nElla compra los cerdos desde que son peque\u00f1os y los alimenta hasta que son adultos y estan listos para ser vendidos.

Among them are sales of used and new clothes, grocery sales, leather crafts, food preparation, among others.  They all are from the Padre de las Casas Commune.\r\n\r\nJessica is communal bank group president and in the photo is seated in the second row, third from right to left.  She\u2019s wearing a short-sleeve pink shirt; her hair is short and its color is black.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been doing crafts for ten years.  Specifically, she knits with sheep\u2019s wool yarn.  Among her products are socks, caps and vests.  She comments that she learned the occupation from a course the local municipality taught.  She comments that some days of the week she sets herself up in a crafts fair and the rest of the days she sells in a more personalized way to acquaintances nearby.\r\n\r\nShe buys her materials directly from people who work shearing sheep in the countryside.  She will use the loan to buy sheep\u2019s wool yarn.  One of her business goals is to get ahead so that she can open a stand-alone store.\r\n\r\nJessica lives with her husband and one of her two daughters who attends school.  One of her dreams is to teach the occupation to determined people who might want to venture into it.  She\u2019s very happy and grateful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza is giving her because it will allow her to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nShe comments that her job as a communal bank group leader has been a very enriching experience for her personal development; her group has facilitated her tenure in office by being united and committed.\r\n\r\nPadre Las Casas is a commune in south Chile near the city of Temuco in the Araucan\u00eda region.  It was named in honor of the Spanish priest Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas who was a defender of Indian rights during the conquest of America.  This commune is noted for having a significant Mapuche population.  Its economy is based on agroindustry and commercial services.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7650,"image":{"id":1072317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy

She has already received and successfully repaid six loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buys wood and timbers. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Ram Keshari plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn Nepal, furniture is still made the old-fashioned way. Using little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans form raw lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture. With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets. With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of their lumber purchases or hire additional labor. This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability.

They are all from the city of Temuco.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Irma can be found in the first row, second spot from the right, wearing a beige short-sleeved shirt.  Her hair is short and copper-colored.  She makes a living in the confectionery field, specifically in the production of cakes and pastries of different flavors and sizes.  She has worked in this field for 12 years, and says she took a course in a group which included her at that time.  She says that she has equipped a small place in her house so that she can prepare her products; nevertheless, she still cannot use it to sell directly to her clients because she still needs to obtain the health permit, which she will receive this year.  For now she only sells by asking door to door.  She buys her ingredients in wholesale supermarkets every three months.  With the loan she will buy ingredients to prepare her confectionery products.  One of her goals is to formalize her location and business in order to sell directly to her clients.\r\n\r\nIrma lives with her husband who is retired, and also with her 20 year old son who studies psychology.  One of her dreams in her personal life is to travel or spend a few days of relaxation in some thermal baths (baths of hot mineral water).  She is very happy and grateful for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza since it will allow her to invest in her business.  Furthermore, she feels very comfortable participating with the other entrepreneurs since it is a good, united, and committed group.  With regard to the training, she says it has bettered her business through accounting strategies and organization.  \r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region.  The city is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile).  In its surrounding areas there are a series of lake resorts (Puc\u00f3n, Villarrica) and very colorful native flora and fauna concentrated in nearby nature parks.  It's worth pointing out that 50% of the Mapuches, an indigenous people that live in our country, live in this

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNenita hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups who meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

He is a farmer. She has a daughter, Haylline, who is 6 years old and in first grade of primary school.\r\n\r\nShe sells clothing, and tells us that she will invest her loan in stocking her business, as she needs to buy clothing to update all her items to the latest styles. For example, she needs to buy more party dresses, casual pants, stylish blouses, as well as ladies' and men's underwear. This way, both Patricia and the customers will benefit.

is Marissa, 46, a resident of Taguig City, Philippines. She is married to Moises, an employee. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMarissa maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer\u2019s order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 3,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarissa hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having her own house. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1075673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acuden a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 art\u00edculos de consumo que se venden en las tiendas, como v\u00edveres, carnes, abarrotes y materias primas en mayor volumen para elaborar nuevos productos de panader\u00eda, porque aun cuenta con su horno, vitrinas cilindradoras y produce panes y postres, los que reparte en su vitrina rodante . ","en":"Karina is 32 and lives in the city of Cartagena with her partner and their two children, ages 5 and 7. She has a bakery there, where she produces bread and baked treats. With the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she sells these to people in Macroproyecto Ciudad Bicentenario, the place where she lives.\r\n\r\nShe had started her bakery in another neighborhood with her partner, but the rainy season floods eroded their dwelling and they lost their property. This was how she and her family were relocated to this large housing complex.\r\n\r\nKarina and her family are very persevering people, as before launching their store, they had been displaced from their land in Bol\u00edvar department, and subsequently, when they were working their hardest, they survived the rainy season flooding. But they are not letting themselves be defeated by adversity, and that's why they have launched their own bakery in Ciudad Bicentenario. \r\n\r\nBenefitting from their previous experience, they have in mind a store where they also sell snacks, food supplies, and basic household items. This is their business: Karina's husband prepares the bread and baked treats and she very creatively goes out to sell with her display case on wheels, selling all over the large neighborhood where she now lives.\r\n\r\nThey have many dreams of prosperity, such as fitting up a stand-alone store for the proper functioning of their small business.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why they are approaching their credikiva for their first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. By this means she will buy food items that are sold in stores, such as food supplies, meats, groceries, and ingredients in greater volume for making new bakery products. This is because she still has her oven and rolling display case, and produces breads and baked treats that she distributes in her rolling display case.

These sales will help her to support her family, as she is a widow and has eight children.\r\n  \r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the health center.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, you can also see a woman in a yellow top with the group, she is the daughter of Ms. Porfiria."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1073222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Venta de coca","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-04-25T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-25T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Severina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Porfiria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12121.2,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":591.67,"local_amount":4040.4,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4058.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243446,"comment":null},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":2020.2,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516314,"comment":null},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":2020.2,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441249,"comment":null},{"amount":295.84,"local_amount":2020.2,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495187,"comment":null},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":2020.2,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260734,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T10:19:57Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":417462,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a 38-year-old married man living in Kamwenge, Uganda.

Kalipa's husband was an accountant at the local collective farm, the family had livestock and land, on which they cultivated vegetables and grains, using their profits to purchase additional farm animals. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Kalipa's husband passed away as the result of an illness. Her children and grandchildren helped Kalipa overcome her grief. Presently, she is supported by her youngest son, who has become the main helper in her business. Thanks to Kalipa's persistence and hard work, her herd currently has 3 horned animals and 1 horse.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her expand and continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to add to her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElvira hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to afford to give her child a good and high quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1075692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-25T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-25T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":178.12,"local_amount":7499.97,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":7602.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095686,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":3333.03,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3378.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359295,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3379.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303110,"comment":null},{"amount":98.95,"local_amount":4166,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4223.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355855,"comment":null},{"amount":39.59,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1689.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308113998,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-23T21:42:15Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":417470,"name":"Rizaldo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rizaldo is 43 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Mariam is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has two children, one of whom is currently in school. For the past three years, Mariam has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells fresh food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mariam has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more food for resale, and will help Mariam to generate greater profits and pay for the children's medical expenses. In the future, Mariam hopes that she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house on it. \r\n\r\nMariam is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Mariam's future prospects by helping her to learn how to budget for her family.

Molly is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past three years, Molly has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells fresh food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Molly has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food for resale and will help Molly to generate greater profits and take care of her family. Molly hopes that in the future she will be able to start a supermarket of her own. \r\n\r\nMolly is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Molly's future prospects by helping her to manage to take care of her family.

Martin owns a shop in his neighborhood (\"Pak\" means something like \"father\" and is used to identify a person respectfully.). His shop is located on a strategic corner in the neighborhood, and is painted pink. His neighbors call his shop the pinky Shop. \n\nIn this shop, he sells various everyday items and provides extraordinary services. The items he sells include food, drinks, mineral water, rice, instant noodles, stationery, and lamps and other electrical devices. Also--last but not least--he provides tire repair services. \n\nPak Martin runs this business along with his wife. However, he will be the one who interacts more with the customers and makes sure they are happy with the services he provides. Pak Martin has three sons. The oldest is 24, the second one is 23, and the youngest one is 18 years old. \n\nFor quite some time, Pak Martin has been very interested in becoming a Loket Ruma agent. The ones who encouraged him the most are actually all of his neighbors. The reason is that with a Loket Ruma business, he can actually provide more value-added services for his customers and generate more income for his family. His customers, who are mostly his neighbors, would come to his Warung Pinki and pay their bills. He hopes that most of the payments will be for electricity bills. This loan will serve as a damage deposit for the electronic data capture (EDC) device that as an agent, Pak Martin will use to enter payments and print receipts for customers.

This business will help her to support herself, since she is single.\r\n  \r\nWhen asked what she likes most about Pro Mujer, she replies that she likes the health center because it's free and has quick service."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1074051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy potatoes and rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-04-25T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-25T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ines Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deysi Mirna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faviola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":9494.94,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1899.07},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1899.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1899.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1899.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1898.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":560.02,"local_amount":3798.14,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3841.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243457,"comment":null},{"amount":280.02,"local_amount":1899.07,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1920.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516325,"comment":null},{"amount":280.01,"local_amount":1899.07,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1920.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441260,"comment":null},{"amount":279.95,"local_amount":1898.66,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1920.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495198,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-03T19:49:35Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":416612,"name":"Carmen Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Carmen Rosa naci\u00f3 en el distrito de Huayllabamba, provincia de Urubamba en el departamento del Cusco - Per\u00fa, casada, con 56 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 6 hijos, 3 de los cuales dependen directamente de ella y de su trabajo. \nSu actividad principal es la compra y venta de granos de ma\u00edz para semilla, adem\u00e1s comercia productos tales como zapallo, el cual adquiere en grandes cantidades y posteriormente lo vende en el mercado de Juliaca en el departamento de Puno - Per\u00fa, y es precisamente para comprar zapallo que la se\u00f1ora Carmen Rosa necesita de un pr\u00e9stamo, el cual le permita concretar su negocio, realizar la transacci\u00f3n y mejorar sus ingresos para invertirlo nuevamente en su actividad, darle crecimiento sostenible para el desarrollo de su familia.\n\n","en":"Carmen Rosa was born in Huayllabamba District, Urubamba Province in Cusco Department, Per\u00fa.

","en":"Mukaddas is 35 years old, married to Golibjon and raising three children.  She is a teacher at a general education school.  She is very well loved and respected at the school.  She also has a second profession - she is a good seamstress and has many students and regular clients.  In search of a source of income for her family, Mukaddas started her own business.  She used her first loan to purchase a sewing machine.  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, she was able to develop her business.

However, his sewing machine is not ideal for working with leather; sometimes the needle cannot enter the material because it is too thick.

She generates her own income by selling products through specialized product guides and also food products and sweets, among other things.\r\nShe started her business approximately 2 years ago when a multinational came to her town with a promotions campaign, offering her the chance to become a promoter of their products through specialized guides; she heard about this experience through friends who had done it and so she became part of it, too, and obtained clients through her family, neighbors and friends, who, little by little, referred her to more clients.  \r\nShe credits her sales 1 month in advance according to the amount her client buys. She buys product every 21 days, like you do when you have this type of job, and pays her bills in the same amount of time.\r\nAs a mother, head of the household, her biggest challenge is to provide and meet the needs of her children until she achieves her dream of seeing them become successful people; they are the impetus for her to continually work. Lately, she added new cosmetics to her offerings and also offers domestic services to a family, in order to generate more income to support the household expenses that she shares with her mother and sisters, with whom she lives.\r\nHer joy and dynamism help her succeed in her business, but she needs to increase her business capital to achieve her goal of generating more income. This is why she is requesting her 1st Kiva loan with Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy varied merchandise like cosmetics. She needs disposable income to stock up on more products and to offer her clients more products.

is a 52-year-old widow and a mother of three daughters and two sons who are still dependent on her.

She farms on a 1.5 hectare farmland once per year, and she has been in this business for almost 14 years. She supplements her income by feeding chickens to sell once every three months. \r\n\r\nLiving in a village of the Prey Chhor district, she has been facing several challenges in earning to support her family, such as fruitless rice farming and low earned income to support her five children.

It is a tourist spot and frequented by families on weekends and during vacation seasons to enjoy the beach, breezes and sea and the delicious meals prepared with the area specialty, seafood.  Rosa, who lives with her 9 year old son in this beautiful place, has a business where she sells fish and beer, taking advantage of the market potential and her experience coming from a traditional family of fishermen.  Her three brothers are fishermen and are part of her business.  In their business they have a fishing boat with an outboard motor and two gill nets.  They fish in the Ca\u00f1o Dulce area, a resort located 30 minutes from Puerto Colombia, and they take the fish to Rosa for her to sell.  This business has been running for 20 years and they have a reputable client base.  Additionally, Rosa has a stand where she sells beer on weekends, a business independent from her brothers.  She is currently applying for a Kiva loan because the investment in the working capital of her business is a challenge.  With this first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo foundation she will buy beer directly instead of from middlemen and will be able to repair the two nets.  Her investment will be successful because she will gain the cost of the intermediary and will improve the equipment that will make the fishing more effective. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1074131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to repair 2 fishing nets and purchase beer directly.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-04-25T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-25T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":61775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141234,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":61775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101115,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":61775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338728,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":61775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395290,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":61775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775094,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":61775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387080,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":247100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993936,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-26T17:24:26Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":416652,"name":"Virgilio  Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Virgilio tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero,  vive en la ciudad de la ceiba Atl\u00e1ntida.\nVirgilio hace dos a\u00f1os tiene un negocio de venta de comida y de frutas.
