She started to build her house last spring with the help of some hired builders. Her house is being built with bricks for stability. But suddenly, she has encountered a money shortage to purchase the rest of the building materials. Now, she wants to make the walls' insulation by foam and cement in order to have a warm house and prevent heat loss. In Mongolia, the winter temperatures are frigid, with the average temperature being -35 C minimum. Most Mongolians use coal-burning stoves to just stay warm in their homes. Tserendolgor believes she will probably not use a coal-burning furnace at her new house if she designs her home smartly.

His two daughters always get sick from the cold in their home. To improve the situation, Mr. Bayanmunkh has started building a house for his family.

He can cut the cost of his coal fuel by having electric heating. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold with snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night by families just trying to stay warm.  Also, the toxic smoke from the cars is one of main causes of Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this situation, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems, and to buy cars that run on natural gas. The loan Mr. Bayanmunkh is taking will cover the cost of a new electric heating panel for his new family house.

Lilia started out selling juice and then food from a street-side table.  Now that she has a place of business, she has learned how to build a clientele.  She hopes to purchase the space, as it is located in a good area. \r\n\r\nThis is Lilia's 12th loan with MFP, and so she expects to meet her objectives.  She also says that she feels good about her communal bank.  She has permanent support from the other members and from her adviser.  \r\n\r\nWith the sum that she has requested of 1000 nuevos soles, ($400 USD), Lilia will invest in the purchase of tables and chairs for her customers' comfort.

lives with his life partner and their children. He grows corn and sorghum. He has worked in agriculture for years, and this has given him a lot of experience that always allows him to obtain the best harvests. The land he farms is in an area with a lot of agricultural activity and is close to his residence. He sells in all the areas near his town, and he has a lot of customers, since people know that everything he sells is of the highest quality and at low prices. Additionally, the service is unequalled, and he is always at his customers' disposal. Vicente is a very responsible, honest, and humble man. He is always awaiting new opportunities since he knows that that is the only way he will succeed. Vicente is a motivated and very hard-working man. He likes to work hard because he knows it is the secret of success. In the last planting he had a lot of losses due to the weather, so this harvest season he wants to increase his production. However, he needs capital to back the purchase of supplies, so he is asking INTEGRAL for a loan that allows him to buy corn seed, sorghum, herbicide, manure, etc. Vicente has good payment references and he promises that he will be able to pay back the debt and at the same time offer his family financial security."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1155857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy corn seed, sorghum, herbicide, and manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-08-09T22:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-08T22:30:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicente ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":305,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":305}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.75,"local_amount":49.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301330217,"comment":null},{"amount":152.95,"local_amount":143.54,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":152.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846939,"comment":null},{"amount":119.3,"local_amount":111.96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":119.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356448400,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-12T19:51:35Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:32:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":457860,"name":"Rosefel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosefel is from Sepac, Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental.

He lives with his life partner and their two children. He grows cereals such as corn, beans and sorghum. He has been working in agriculture for many years and has accumulated very valuable experience, which allows him to obtain very good crops. The plot of land where he sows is located in a highly agricultural area. He makes his sales in all the neighboring areas and he has a lot of customers. People prefer to buy from him because they're certain that everything he sells is high quality at low prices, and also the service is one of a kind, always at his customers' disposal.

She\u2019s married to Hilter, the father of her three children.\r\n\r\nHer activity is selling soft-drinks in assorted flavors and brands.  To do so she has a refrigerator she bought with her savings where she keeps her drinks cold.  She started out with an MFP loan over a year ago and she likes her business because it allows her to stay at home and take care of her little ones who she loves very much while earning income needed to pay household expenses.  On the other hand, what she does not like is when it rains often because her sales drop since she\u2019s very weather-dependent since she lives in a hot climate zone.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #4 for her.  She\u2019s comfortable in her communal bank because she considers the people to be responsible and mutually supportive.

lives with his wife and four children in a house that he has owned for 17 years.  He operates a farming business, growing beans and maize.  He has been a farmer for many years and says that he has learned what it takes to bring in good harvests.  The land that he rents is well situated for crops.  He sells in local markets and has many customers.  They seek him out because they know that he can deliver a good product at a reasonable price.  Armando is an honest, hard-working man with a strong drive to get ahead.  He's always looking for new opportunities that can lead to new successes.

Saidaly's wife, Chamilya, is a history teacher at a school.  Saidaly has been working as an assistant director at a school for gifted children for over ten years.  His salary is small.  Saidaly is a kind father and grandfather.  He and his wife are very respected in their family because both of them are teachers and very well-educated people.  Saidaly currently lives with his family in a three-bedroom apartment.  He bought a plot of land two years ago and started to build a house because he has dreamed of living in a custom-built house all his life.  He has been building his house for two years.  He built the main part, but paint work for the interior and exterior of the house, ceilings, walls and installation of doors and windows in the rooms, bathroom and sauna remain.  Saidaly wants to use this loan in the amount of $2000 to finish building his house before the winter in order to celebrate the new year with his whole family in the new

He lives with his spouse and daughter and enjoys very good references and a united family.  He lives in a community dedicated to commerce, agriculture and animal husbandry.  \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s a person who started being a great, responsible worker from a very young age whose only goal was to give his family the best.  Because of this, Santiago has been working in carpentry at home in Cayalti in north Per\u00fa.  He provides his community with a key service needed to repair objects or parts of houses that are often in poor condition as well as designing furniture for homes or businesses.  \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s because of this that Santiago is looking for a 1600 sol loan from Edpyme Alternativa with Kiva support to buy more merchandise (cedar lumber, glue, mahogany, etc.) to stock his business and sales thus meeting currently unmet customer demand.  He will expand his clientele leading to new, additional income for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1157279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy carpentry supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cayalt\u00ed -

This year he has decided to approach the institution, INTEGRAL, to apply for the requested loan so that he can invest in the fertilizer needed for crops to obtain an abundant harvest.  This allows him to continue taking food home and maintains his hope that with his work, God's help, and this institution, he will be able to achieve and improve his quality of life and that of his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1156343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

No logr\u00f3 terminar sus estudios debido a la falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos de su familia esto lo llevo a trabajar la tierra desde muy temprana edad por lo que ya cuenta con mucha experiencia en el \u00e1rea. A\u00f1o  con a\u00f1o realiza la misma actividad de preparar la tierra, sembrar los granos b\u00e1sicos, y cosechar los frutos de sus cultivos. Despu\u00e9s de sacar la cosecha la pone a la venta en los principales puntos de venta de su municipio. De esta forma lleva el sustento a su hogar y es as\u00ed como ha logrado mantener a su familia por mucho tiempo. El cultivo de ma\u00edz, frijoles y maicillo es por temporada por lo que cada ano  todo campesino como Roberto tiene que trabajar muy duro para sacar lo mejor de la cosecha y as\u00ed poder almacenar la cantidad necesaria para la subsistencia del resto del a\u00f1o. Al igual que cada temporada el se\u00f1or Roberto no quiere quedarse atr\u00e1s y se ha propuesto sacar una abundante cosecha ya que sue\u00f1a con dar a sus hijos lo mejor y quiere sacarlos adelante para que gocen de mejores condiciones a las que \u00e9l ha tenido acceso.

He did not finish his education because of his family\u2019s lack of resources; he started working the land from a very young age so he now has quite a bit of experience in this line of work.\r\n\r\nYear to year he carries out the same activity to prepare the land, plant basic grains and harvest the fruits.  Once he takes in the harvest he sells it in the municipality\u2019s main sales points.  In this way he supports his home and is how he\u2019s managed to support his family for a long time.\r\n\r\nGrowing corn, beans and sorghum is seasonal so every year Roberto, like all farmers, must work hard to get the best from his harvest and be able to store enough to subsist for the rest of the year.  Like in every season, Roberto does not want to fall behind and he\u2019s determined to produce an abundant harvest because he dreams with providing his children with the best and he wants to move them ahead so that they can enjoy better conditions than those he\u2019s been able to attain for himself.  Because of this, he\u2019s asking for help from INTEGRAL to buy farming supplies (manure, seeds, insecticide, etc.) needed to produce a good harvest and to reach his dream of giving his family the best and to attain economic stability.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1156397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and farm supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-08-10T23:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-09T23:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301330223,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-19T20:32:54Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":458327,"name":"Ebby","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ebby is a 54 year-old businesswoman.
