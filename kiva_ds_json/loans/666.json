He sells chicken with rice, fish with rice, arepas [turnovers], turnovers and fried cheese sticks that he transports daily in his bike\/car vehicle to sell them for cash to his clientele located in the industrial park near his house.  His dream is to turn his business into a food distributorship and also to acquire a house of his own.

Thus, he gets up every morning in order to feed the animals and to look after them. His knowledge and skills allow him to make his business successful and to generate a stable, considerable income for his large family.\n  \nHis wife, who is a school teacher, helps Alkhamid in looking after the sheep. Alkhamid monthly profit from sheep selling is about 350 USD.\n\nAlkhamid is planning to further develop his business by enlarging the stock and purchasing more sheep. For this purpose, he requests a 1,500 AZN loan that he will spend for the purchase of sheep and lambs and for feed for them. After fattening them up, he will be able to sell them for a more favorable price. Then, Alkhamid will be able to use the profit from his business towards the well-being of his family. \n\nHe has already demonstrated himself as a good client, having successfully completed three

is a 38-year-old young woman who is married and has three sons and five daughters. She lives in Azzon Atmeh village near Qalqilia city located in Palestine. Her husband is employed in a school with a decent salary. Iman has a grocery store, which is another source of income for the family and she wants to improve the store by purchasing groceries in bulk to sell and increase their income. But the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay for the groceries, so she needs to take a loan of $1,500 from FATEN.

Maritza has a business where she sells basic household goods for cash and sometimes on credit.  Her inventory includes snacks, provisions, soft drinks, canned goods, meats, and other products.  Her main customers are housewives looking to buy ingredients for preparing their daily meals or for cleaning products to use around the home.  Maritza started her business four years ago with some capital given to her by her husband.  Through hard work, she purchased shelving and established the store in her home.  Her business grew gradually and she later equipped her store with a cooler and some display cabinets.  She also renovated the infrastructure so that now she has a larger store.  Two years ago she began renting out her business because she separated from her husband and then went to go live with her mother.  Within the last eight months, she has reclaimed her business due to bad management by her tenant.  Through her daily work, Maritza has managed to press forward and is excited about being able to grow.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She has a store where she sells various merchandise, but she also offers products through specialty catalogs of major companies.  When she started her business, Yolbin was excited about being able to help with the household expenses and achieve greater well-being.  She began selling shoes, but later added products through catalogs.  As a result, she built up her own capital which she used to increase her sales.  Today she also has a display case on the terrace of her house and shelves where she can show off the products that she sells.  Her goal moving forward is to convert her variety shop into a large store where current and potential customers can come to buy everything they need and want.  The main products that she sells are perfumes, cosmetics, cards, miscellaneous items, and household appliances by request.  Yolbin takes into account what is lacking in her displays.  Her main suppliers are the warehouses in the central part of the city and the specialty catalogs that frequently advertise good promotional offers.  Her business is managed by her uncle since she works at a part-time job in the mornings to earn income.  In the afternoons, Yolbin takes over her business.  Competition is high, but there is much public demand to generate income for all the businesses.  Her greatest challenge is the lack of operating capital that would enable her to respond quickly to her customers.

He has a restaurant that is located along the main thoroughfare in town.  Pedro started this business after working at a family-owned restaurant.

Pedro bought cookware, eight sets of tables and chairs, a freezer, and a stove to furnish a rental location where he is able to carry out his work.

In the meantime, Pedro makes the most of his youth so that he can achieve great dreams.  He manages a contribution margin of 36% and profitability of no less than 17.26%.

She is supported in this business by her husband.\r\n\r\nRuby's business has gradually grown and now her main customers are not only housewives but also restaurants and businesses that sell special meals.  This helps her business' growth as they always refer new buyers to her.  Ruby's main challenge is having enough working capital to buy new sheds and to feed her increasing number of birds.  For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan to buy sheds in which to raise her animals.  This will help increase her income which her family depends upon.  The profit she makes in her business is not less than 34%.  We envisage her potential growth and predict a successful investment of her Kiva loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":864520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheds

Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has been repairing vehicles for more than ten years. At this time he has rented out a repair shop where he can attract many new customers and make money. His business is going well and brings profit. He repairs two or three vehicles a day and makes a good profit. His father and brother are carpenters and sometimes in his free time Kosimjon helps them. Kosimjon would like to receive a loan in the amount of $1000USD to buy spare parts to repair vehicles. He wants to thank all of you for your help and support in advance.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He always dreamed to have his own land and a lot of cattle to create his own farm. For more than seven years he has been in this business and tries to expand it. He is married and is a loving father of five children. The income which he receives from the business is spent on the needs of his family and expansion of the business.

is Emily, 40, a resident of GMA, Cavite City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmily operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmily hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":865538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"    To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business..","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-10T14:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3519.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764621,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2815.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571742,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2815.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529292,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1407.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738512,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-11T19:34:29Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333846,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter, a single man who describes himself as patient, has operated a boda boda transport service employing one staff member for the past year.

Evangelista is a single mother and her home is a simple structure that she shares with her three children. Her most difficult challenge is to begin her new cafeteria business. Evangelista says that her business efforts will make it possible to provide for her family. In the meantime, she plans to continue to enjoy attending and participating in church and doing business.\r\n\r\nEvangelista will use her portion of this group loan to invest in her butcher shop and she is planning to buy a cow to butcher and sell. She also sells boiled beans that neighborhood people buy to cook them faster at home. She began her business by selling these boiled beans and after she saved enough money she began buying meat such as chicken, beef, and pork, to start a butcher shop.

He is single and lives in his own house built from rustic wood, with a metal roof. With great care, he has managed to turn his land into a verdant place, surrounded by leafy trees and cocoa plants, coffee plants, and barbasco root.\r\n\r\nHe has been doing this for 10 years, and also has the support of laborers.  He also mentions that when he was a small child he learned to work the land, thanks to the teachings of his parents, and now works on his own land.\r\n\r\nHis most profitable product is barbasco root, because he sells it to companies that use it to make insecticides and fungicides.\r\n\r\nThanks to the income he has earned, he has managed to buy more land and a mototaxi, which he uses to transport his products.\r\n\r\nIn the months of August through October, his main activity is planting all types of seeds; for this he has sought a loan to be able to carry out the planting of more barbasco seeds.  The plan he has in mind is to continue planting and buying more land so that he can overcome poverty.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan, and he is very happy to know that he will have financial support, as this way he will feel secure in going forward with his plans.  With the 2,500 nuevos soles, he will buy more barbasco seeds.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":865711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy barbasco seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T05:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Duarte ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":177.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":177.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":178.7},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":192.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":194.68},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":201.73},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":212.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":216.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":225.68},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":231.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":242.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":248.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.03},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":143.65,"local_amount":388.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":391.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851285,"comment":null},{"amount":55.4,"local_amount":149.72,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":151.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621620,"comment":null},{"amount":69.57,"local_amount":188.02,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":189.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835702,"comment":null},{"amount":73.31,"local_amount":198.13,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":199.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245463,"comment":null},{"amount":151.91,"local_amount":410.58,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":414.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098597,"comment":null},{"amount":80.18,"local_amount":216.71,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":218.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712816,"comment":null},{"amount":86.22,"local_amount":233.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":235.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201930,"comment":null},{"amount":88.19,"local_amount":238.34,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":240.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097705,"comment":null},{"amount":88.61,"local_amount":239.49,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":241.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400640,"comment":null},{"amount":87.96,"local_amount":237.72,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":239.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452406,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T06:38:47Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333947,"name":"Sindy Anael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Sindy Anael  tiene 6 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a una pulper\u00eda.

She lives with her partner Julian who is 29 years old and Ezequiel, their school-aged child who is 5 years old. They live in the town of Sirenachayocc where they have their own house. What they most want is to provide their son with a comfortable environment. Sarita emphasizes that everything she obtains is through her tenacity and devotion to her cocoa, coffee and sesame crops. It is for this reason that she tries to give her crops the best possible care and under this premise many of her buyers have been satisfied by the quality of her agricultural products. Nevertheless, she strives to do her best every day and devotes a good amount of time to her crops. She does this with the help of her partner. However, at harvest time she has to hire labourers to speed up the harvesting process in their daily efforts to obtain a good income. With the requested loan, Sarita will buy more cocoa plants and hopes to graft them as they grow. Her future plan is to invest her income in other businesses such as guinea pig breeding. This will be her first loan and she is very happy to know that she will have financial support. She is willing to comply promptly with her repayment schedule. With the loan she will acquire cocoa plants to expand her crops and obtain higher revenues later.\n\n.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":865734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cocoa plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":266.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":272.45},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":284.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":292.62},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":303.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":317.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":325.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":338.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":349.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.89},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.48},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.29,"local_amount":254.44,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":254.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851287,"comment":null},{"amount":96.02,"local_amount":261.85,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":261.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666470,"comment":null},{"amount":101.45,"local_amount":276.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":276.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621623,"comment":null},{"amount":102.92,"local_amount":280.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":280.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835705,"comment":null},{"amount":107.3,"local_amount":292.62,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":292.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245466,"comment":null},{"amount":111.17,"local_amount":303.21,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":303.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385514,"comment":null},{"amount":246.58,"local_amount":672.5,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":672.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712819,"comment":null},{"amount":114.92,"local_amount":313.43,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":313.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201933,"comment":null},{"amount":126.35,"local_amount":344.56,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":344.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097708,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T21:11:53Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333959,"name":"Philippe","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Philippe est un homme \u00e2g\u00e9 de 32 ans.

She is a cheerful and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her husband, 30-year-old Josu\u00e9, and the couple's two children who were born as a result of their love and who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe hard work that Mery carries out on her farm together with her husband means that their crops are very well cared for and when sale time comes around their produce sells quickly.  Mery's main source of income is selling cacao, coffee and bananas.  She owns a total of 3 'cuadras' of land (one 'cuadra' = approx. 0.75 hectares).  She sells the fruit from her plants in the town of San Francisco and at harvest time she hires laborers so that she can pick her fruit more quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat Mery most enjoys about her work is harvesting her land as this is when she feels that her work is paying off.  She has been in this business for five years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be protecting her crops from the pests that can mercilessly attack the first shoots of each plantation.  Over time, she would like to acquire more land so that she can grow more crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Mery's third loan from MFP.  She has been very punctual in making her previous repayments and works without causing problems for the MFI.  She hopes that on this occasion she will be able to count on your help so that she can continue doing well.  She will use the 2,000 soles that she has requested to buy fertilizers in order to improve her production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":865813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":135.53},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":142.65},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":145.6},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":152.74},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":162.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":170.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":174.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":181.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":186.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":194.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":198.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.82,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":138.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851289,"comment":null},{"amount":53.5,"local_amount":142.65,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666473,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":145.6,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":148.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835707,"comment":null},{"amount":57.28,"local_amount":152.74,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:46Z","rounded_local_amount":156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245469,"comment":null},{"amount":58.65,"local_amount":156.4,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098602,"comment":null},{"amount":190.01,"local_amount":506.69,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":518.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201936,"comment":null},{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":181.3,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":185.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400643,"comment":null},{"amount":20.51,"local_amount":54.7,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-20T08:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":55.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123143,"comment":null},{"amount":196.64,"local_amount":524.39,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":536.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869165,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-14T14:46:21Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:34:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333986,"name":"Martha Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Martha es comerciante, se dedica a la compra y venta de cerdos, compra cerdo peque\u00f1os el cual, los compra  a menor costo engorda y destaza sacando buenas ganancias.

She sews clothing for the home, such as tablecloths and curtains. She makes a certain amount of clothing, stores them in individual bags and then travels around the area where she lives to sell what she has made. To her older clients she offers credit facilities. Her workshop is located in her own home where she has worked for the last 13 years. Margarita says that before becoming a seamstress, she was a cooking teacher at a food store. However, due to health reasons she had to change direction. However she was operated on 2 years ago and now only has to undergo treatment and checkups. She works Monday through Friday in the afternoons and spends her weekends selling her products.  \r\n\r\nShe buys her consumables in the town of Independencia as the prices are inexpensive. With the loan she will buy an overlock sewing machine and fabric with which to run her sewing business. The remainder of the loan she will use to buy paraffin as she will make the most of the winter season to sell. \r\n\r\nHer business goal is to set up her business in a permanent location to offer and sell her sewing products. This would give her great peace of mind and be good for her health. Margarita lives with her son who is 28 years old and depends on others for work. Her dreams at a personal level are to rebuild her home with solid materials to keep them warm during the winter. Her house is located on a piece of land that was given to her. Another of her dreams is to help the less fortunate on a voluntary basis: she already prepares lunches at an open house for the aged. \r\n\r\nMargarita is very happy and thankful for the loans and services provided by Fondo Esperanza. Thanks to the training sessions given at the meetings of the communal bank group she has been better able to organize and administer her business.

are many Cambodians who make a living as rice cultivators. One of them is Mr. Ka, who has been working in this sector since 2005. He and his wife grow rice on their own farmland that they inherited from their grandparents. They have four children. Two of the children are married and live independently, and the other two are living with him.\r\n\r\nFrom this business, Ka earns about $3 each day. To create more output in their farming business, he and his wife would like to purchase more farmland, but lack money. He decided with his wife to request some funds through HKL, a partner with Kiva.

He has a store selling construction supplies. He wants to expand his work and purchase more construction supplies to sell because of high customer demand in the summer season. The amount of money Waseem has isn't enough to pay, so he needs to take a loan of $1,907.34 from FATEN. When Waseem takes his FATEN loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, he can purchase extra construction supplies and so expand his work and increase his income. That will reflect positively on his life so he'll have better living conditions. Waseem is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a 36-year-old young woman. She is married and has two sons and one daughter. She lives in Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza located in Palestine. Her husband is a UN employee in Gaza with a decent salary. Ibtesam wants to replace her home furniture and purchase new ones instead to have better living conditions for her family, but the amount of money Ibtesam has isn't enough to pay so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Ibtesam gets her FATEN loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase new home furniture and live with her family in better conditions. Ibtesam is a religious conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead in the FATEN branch.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

At this time, Victoria is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVictoria operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 13,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVictoria hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
