por ejemplo Juan invertir\u00e1 en su invernadero de frambuesas, Guillermo y Cecilia en una tienda de abarrotes y Virginia en un molino de nixtamal. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque Alcatraz significa abundancia. \n\nJuan es el representante del grupo, tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero, siempre ha vivido en comunidad y por el momento se encuentra viviendo con sus padres. Juan tiene un invernadero de frambuesas, platica que obtuvo su invernadero gracias un apoyo por parte del pap\u00e1 de su novia \u201cYo no sabia nada acerca de frambuesas pero recibimos una capacitaci\u00f3n donde aprend\u00ed a plantarlas y como hacer que crezcan pare obtener una buena cosecha\". Juan tiene 8 meses de experiencia en esta actividad. Lamentablemente, no cuenta con los recursos suficientes para hacer crecer su negocio, es por eso que solicita un cr\u00e9dito. Con el apoyo de VisionFund M\u00e9xico, comprar\u00e1 tubos, plantas de frambuesas y hule. Para Juan es emocionante ver la cantidad de cosecha que obtuvo en los 6 meses pasados, especialmente porque la cosecha de frambuesa es exportada a los Estados Unidos \"aunque me va muy bien con mi negocio, s\u00ed me gustar\u00eda hacerlo mas grande para poder mejorar mi calidad de vida y mi vivienda\". Juan est\u00e1 muy agradecido con la instituci\u00f3n ya que gracias al cr\u00e9dito podr\u00e1 comprar el material que le hace falta para su huerto. ","en":"\nThis is the first time the \u201cAlcatraz\u201d group is requesting a loan from the institution.  They are very committed to do well.  It\u2019s a group of four people each with a different productive activity and this is why they are requesting a loan to invest in their respective activities.  For example, Juan will invest in his raspberry nursery, Guillermo and Cecilia in a grocery store and Virginia in a nixtamal [corn for making tortillas and tamales, etc.] mill.  They chose this name because Alcatraz means abundance.\n\nJuan is the group representative, he is 28-years-old, unmarried and has always lived in the community.  For the moment, he\u2019s living with his parents and Juan has a raspberry nursery.  He got the nursery thanks to support he received from the father of his girlfriend.  Juan commented: \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about raspberries but we received some training where I learned how to plant them and how to make them grow and obtain a good harvest.\"    Juan has been doing this activity for 8 months now and the only difficulty is the lack of resources to enlarge his business.  He is requesting the loan to buy tubes, raspberry plants and the rubber.  Juan is motivated most from seeing the amount of harvest he got during the last six months because the raspberry harvests are exported to the United States.  Juan says, \"Although I do well in my business I\u2019d like to make it bigger to improve my quality of life and to make some home improvements, among others.\"  Juan is very grateful to the institution FRAC because thanks to the loan he will be able to buy what he

 is a married man. He has four children, with ages ranging from 2 years to 12 years. He describes himself as a business-minded and customer-friendly man. \r\n\r\nHe operates a restaurant where he sells food, tea, and snacks.  He has been involved in this business for two years. His business is located within a viable urban area, and his primary customers are local residents.

At 52 years old, she is on her 25th loan cycle, and she is a married mother of eight children and several grandchildren. Her husband runs a small business. Mwadji started her business with funds from her husband that amounted to the equivalent of a container of oil. She is a vendor of palm oil at the central market of Virunga and has been in this business for ten years. \r\n\r\nWith this new loan, this client would like to increase her sales by purchase 15 containers of palm oil. She also sells plastic footwear (slippers) to increase her revenues. For the future, she plans on switching her business to general commerce and building a comfortable house.  \r\n\r\nThis client salutes the initiative taken by the microfinance institution Hekima dedicated to autonomy for poor women having no access to banks. The dividends from this Hekima micro-loan are enormous for this client, she says. She remained away from her children for a long time due to the repeated wars in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thanks to Hekima loans, she had easily paid the airfare from Buyimayi to Goma for her

She reports that she started this business gradually; that is to say, she cut out patterns and experimented with them, and she began to enjoy it more and more, so she started to take various courses and made a business out of it. At the beginning it was difficult for her because she had to promote herself to build up a network of customers. It was five years ago that she started her business, and it is now going very well for her. She works every day from 9 in the morning until 1 in the afternoon, since she has another job. Since she is a single mother, she has 2 jobs, and thanks to this and to the effort she puts into her work, she has been able to make progress up to now. Heidi comments that one of her difficulties is her location, because she would like to locate her business in the outside area of her home, opening a sizable store where she can exhibit the crafts she makes. With the loan she will buy materials to make her products, such as foamboard, fabrics, thread and other items. She hopes to continue working so that she can keep supporting her son and get ahead in the profession she has chosen.

He began his business because he didn't attend school; he was only introduced to farming. When he became mature, he farmed on his own and the proceeds he got were used to trade in a used clothing business. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about Le 2,216,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000. Abu has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy 5 bales of Asian dresses @ Le 900,000. In the future, Abu plans to build a house, send his children abroad and provide a quality education for them, and acquire a shop. This loan will help him to accomplish some of his future plans. Some bales sometimes may contain spoiled clothing. He is a hardworking businessman.

She is married, and has 2 children aged 4 and 7 years. All are school going children. She has 2 additional dependents, who live with her though they are distant relatives, but are helped in attending school and they too are helping with domestic work. In 2000, Iye Bah established her food stuff (provisions and vegetables) business. She began her business because she dropped out of school in Form II, and the tribe that she came from does not value girl child education. They believe a woman's place is in her husband's house. She was a victim but she was lucky because her husband is a businessman who trained her and gave her a reasonable sum of money to start a business of her own instead of being a housewife.  Working 6 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 484,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. Iye Bah has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase shrimp Maggie - 6 cartons @ Le 260,000, onions - 10 bags @ Le 90,000, Oil - 9 rubbers @ Le 160,000 and Le 100,000 will be used for transportation.

During the period in which the planting is begun and the crops, preferably cocoa, are maintained, she needs to have everything necessary to eventually obtain an optimum result with regard to the quality of her products, among which the essential item is the organic fertilizer, as well as planting the seedlings.\r\n\r\nIn the future she has thought of growing trees for timber on her land and working on its reforestation, inasmuch as she considers it possible to make money with responsible cutting. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan, and she already feels obligated to make her payments punctually. She feels very happy about the way she works with her fellow members of her communal bank, since they are very responsible people. With the 2000 PEN that she will obtain, she will complete the purchase of plenty of organic compost as well as seedlings for cocoa, which she is thinking of working on in the next season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1219270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to buy organic compost as well as cacao seedlings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-19T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-18T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":214.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":233.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":241.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":238.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":256.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":265.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":269.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":280.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.1,"local_amount":214.45,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":214.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053687,"comment":null},{"amount":90.48,"local_amount":233.49,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":234.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188624,"comment":null},{"amount":93.45,"local_amount":241.17,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":241.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572536,"comment":null},{"amount":92.27,"local_amount":238.11,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":238.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122196,"comment":null},{"amount":99.57,"local_amount":256.95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":257.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868022,"comment":null},{"amount":102.84,"local_amount":265.4,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":266.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576875,"comment":null},{"amount":104.44,"local_amount":269.52,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":270.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529213,"comment":null},{"amount":108.85,"local_amount":280.91,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":281.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-19T05:12:10Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":484209,"name":"Hamoud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamoud is 44 years old and a happy man who treats everyone well because of his opportunities to get ahead.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is extremely fertile for agriculture. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and a personal business.  She has 1 child and has been doing this farming work for 8 years.   \r\n\r\nJeniffer stated what is most enjoyable about farming is seeing her hens grow lay eggs and she loves seeing them lay eggs and also the income from them. Her biggest challenge is getting enough feed for her broiler hens.  She will use this loan to construct a dairy unit and buy poultry birds.\r\n\r\nJeniffer was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'From another Juhudi client.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'She has learnt more on animal husbandry.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Jennifer replied that she will be able to educate her child who is now in university, and she will also be able to feed her family.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jennifer owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

Her primary income sources are milk, crops and a job salary. She has five children and has been doing her work for 10 years.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what is most enjoyable about farming, Jepkosgei says she loves animals and she enjoys feeding them. When asked what is her biggest challenge, she says, \"Feeding the animals can be hectic sometimes.\" The animals on the farm have been given the names <i>Sambu<\/i> and <i>Kendo Goch<\/i>.\r\n\r\nJepkosgei was asked how she learned of Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"from another client\". This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. She says she learnt more about farming as a business. She will use this loan to construct a modern dairy unit for her dairy cows and buy poultry birds as well.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is business-related. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\", Jepkosgei replied that she will be able to get more income; thus, take her children to school. Also she will be able to feed her children well.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jepkosgei owns the following: cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, electricity, TV and DVD, but does not have solar power, running water or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository; thus, reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs down.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1216240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

It is composed of 17 entrepreneurs who work in different areas, among which are weaving, pedicures, greenhouse, mechanic, clothing sales, bazaar, internet , selling coveralls, and services, among others. All of them are from the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nAna, a member of this communal bank group, is standing in the first row of the photo, in the third place going from left to right. She is wearing a black jacket and a light-colored scarf. Her hair is brown, short, and loose. She has been working in handicrafts and has been crocheting (this is the art of creating through repeated interlacing of one or various fibers, using a needle with the form of a hook) for 10 years. She comments that in addition to doing crocheting, she also sells pizzas. She works from Thursday through Sunday selling pizza, and the rest of the week she works at her crocheting. She does all her work at home, and she distributes her work schedule according to her availability.\r\n\r\nSometimes she buys the merchandise and supplies that she needs in the city of Santiago and in places where they sell wool, and for preparing her pizzas, she buys in low-cost supermarkets, which are therefore economically convenient. With the loan she will buy a gas regulator, a gallon of gas, cheese, flour, olives, dough, oil, pizza boxes, and wool of different colors. \r\n\r\nOne of Ana's goals is to have a place to set up a pizzeria in parallel with her crocheting and to join up with her sister and her niece, to thus generate greater income and opt for a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nAna lives with her husband, her mother, and her three children, ages 8 and 7 (twins). Her dreams at a personal and family level are to have her own house and give a good standard of living to her children, and at a business level, to grow as a microentrepreneur.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and thankful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has offered her, since it has allowed her to invest in her business. In addition, she feels very comfortable in the company of the other entrepreneurs in her communal bank group, since they share various activities and interests. From the training offered at the meetings, she has learned to manage her business better.\r\n\r\nTalca belongs to the Maule region, located in the central part of the country. It is an administrative, economic, and cultural center of the region, being the most important city of the Chilean Central Valley. With regard to Talca, there is a curious reference in Chile, the phrase \"Talca, Paris, and London.\" Among the myths regarding the phrase, some say that it is derived from the original saying by an Englishman, \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca resembles London), because of the abundant clouds that frequently cover the city in the winter season, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":1219206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy a gas

She loves poultry and enjoys feeding them! Her biggest challenge is disease that can lead to the death of a large amount of birds. Animals on the farm have been given the names 'Tina.' She will use the loan to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nMonicah chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan after she got information from other existing clients. After Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, Monicah said she learned about how to invest in farming and increase her income.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Monica said that she will get more income which she will use to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Monica owns a cow, poultry, pump, and automobile but does not own a pig, bicycle, or motorcycle. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards that may come from a loan. This borrower has a mosquito net, electricity, running water, TV, and DVD, but does not have solar power or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile

Therefore, since 2010 Balqees is trying to help him by making candles at home. She sells her handmade candles in the market from which she gets a good amount of income to meet daily household expenses. She is interested in growing her business. She is a member of an eight-person lending group. She has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase candle-making materials like wax, wax oil, wax color and some candle-making tools so that she can work more professionally and efficiently and can easily grow her business. She dreams for her children's better future and husband's good health. She wants to live a good and simple life with her family. Salam and many thanks from her to all the staff of Kiva and BRAC Pakistan. Note: In the picture Balqees holding a passbook in her hand.

The group representative, Bernadette (who has her hand raised in the photo) is 32 years old and is married to a man named Kiki. They have four children, all in school. Bernadette and her husband live together, along with their children, and they share the task of meeting the household budget. Bernadette did not go to school. \r\nFor almost fifteen years now, she has sold corn from her home. She does this with great passion, and it allows her to meet her needs and those of her children. She buys the corn in the outlying areas of B\u00e9nin.\r\nIn order to meet consumer demand, she is requesting a first loan - together with the other members of the DJROMAHUTON 15 group. This loan will help them all to better meet their customers needs and also to increase their own

They are from Aden, Yemen and they know each other very well as they have lived in the same neighborhood for a long time. All of their projects are home-based; however, they have many clients, mostly women. All of the group members are considered hardworking people who very much want to get ahead. This group received a loan of 200,000 YER. \n\nHana is 30 years old, married, and has three children. She lives in Aden. She is an affectionate member of this group and she is very happy because her business has improved little by little (she is the woman who is sitting down on the right). She has been distributing mobile recharge cards and perfumes.

is a first-time borrower with this institution. He applied for a loan of three million shillings, but only one million five hundred thousand shillings was approved.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to put a roof on his house, which is currently under construction. He will also use part of it for his fish vending business. Moses buys fish from fish mongers who operate in the nearby bodies of water. He then sells them to markets and individuals. Moses has done this business for the last three years and has been able to purchase a plot of land on which he is constructing a house.

She has been in the business of glove making for five years. The boy shown in the photo is Sajida\u2019s son, who also assists her in this activity of glove stitching. Five years ago Kashf team members approached a family of 10 subsisting on a very low income per month. The bread winner of the family was employed as a daily wage laborer at a cloth factory that was known to be exploiting its workers. The family was suffering from major financial challenges when Sajida, who was then a housewife, decided to take her first loan. She used this money to purchase material that was required to stitch gloves.\r\n\r\nDesperate to support her children who were growing up without going to school, Sajida took her gloves to the market and sold them at a minimal price. Buyers liked her gloves and demanded more. While talking to the Kashf team recently she was delighted to share her business experience and how she has been able to financially progress because of a healthy relationship with Kashf. She said she worried because unlike many other children in her neighborhood her sons and daughters were unable to attend school. Now, as her business is growing and she is able to establish a stable clientele, her children are attending school. \r\n\r\nShe is been in association with Kashf for five years.

Thereafter, Rene attended the Houston School of Floral Design. Inspired by his grandmother, Rene decided to continue her dream and work as a florist.\r\n\r\nRene said \"I was working for other people and I was making them rich with my talent.\" He knew that there was a possibility to generate more income and increase artistic freedom if he had his own business, so he decided to open one in his hometown of Zapata, Texas. At R&R Flower Shop, 20-year-old Rene says, \"I make my own profit and I know what to charge. I love doing this, and if you love what you do, you'll do it even better. That's another thing that sets me apart.\"\r\n\r\nR&R Flower Shop was a dream-come-true for Rene as the idea of opening a flower shop continuously stayed in his mind. Rene says he doesn't take complete advantage of the wholesale price. He sells his flowers at a price slightly higher than what he pays for wholesale. \"We have the best prices in town,\" he says. \"That's how we help our customers.\" Aside from being a master florist, Rene is also a wedding planner, business administrator and event planner.\r\n\r\nBeginning in Rene\u2019s home at the start of 2012, R&R Flower Shop built clientele and blossomed into the storefront model Rene has been running for the past four months. \u201cI\u2019m seeing really good results. I love it,\u201d he said. The shop allows him to work flexible hours and employ his family. \u201cI like to help others as they help me,\u201d he said. Rene said his store is set apart from other nearby floral shops as his team is made of certified florists who focus more on creating modern, or exotic and non-traditional, arrangements, unless a traditional arrangement is what the customer wants. As store policies, Rene said: \u201cWe can make whatever you want and the customers are always right.\u201d \r\n\r\nAfter being denied for a loan at a bank, Rene continued to try to find a lender for his shop. He said he felt that other banks and lenders didn\u2019t want to help him because of his age.  \u201cThey didn\u2019t trust me,\u201d he said. \"I said, 'You don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to.' I just needed an extra push. I\u2019m young, but I have very big dreams.\u201d He later turned to Accion Texas Inc. and was approved. With his loan, Rene purchased inventory and is saving the other half for Valentine\u2019s Day. Rene needs to purchase double the inventory now to sell and generate more money until Valentine\u2019s and Mother\u2019s Day, which are the busiest days of the floral industry. The loan also helps secure his finances. He said because of the loan, \u201cIf someone comes over and needs a wedding tomorrow, I can give them what they want. Without it, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get anywhere. I feel blessed. I put in my head that I wasn\u2019t going to be approved, but I knew I had to put my faith in God, and it worked out.\u201d\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Rene was able to create two new jobs. \u201cI have a janitor and an assistant who takes orders and makes sure the bills are paid. In a year, I plan to have them on payroll,\u201d he said. Since his business is a start-up, he cannot afford to do that as of yet. He pays them when he can, and since he employs family, he says, they understand the situation. \u201cI\u2019m just starting and the business is paying my bills,\u201d he said. When his business expands, Rene plans to hire more certified florists and own a building where he can be a one-stop-shop for special occasion

career in cosmetology was always Carla\u2019s dream, but after some conflicts, she chose to do something else where she didn\u2019t have to attend school. Years later, Carla is currently in school studying psychology and business. \u201cWhat I want to do by next summer is get my license in cosmetology and learn more about professional products, and about the products I sell,\u201d she says. Her business, Elite Hair & Accessories, is based out of her hometown, Dumas, Arkansas.\r\n\r\nElite Hair & Accessories partners with barber shops in Dumas and sells supplies to them. \u201cWe also sell wigs, extensions, neck ties and jewelry,\u201d Carla says. \u201cI always wanted to own my own business,\u201d she says. \u201cThis type of business is just something I\u2019ve always been interested in. I\u2019ve always loved doing hair and make-up, and I love jewelry,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nCarla has had her business for about a year. Through the Accion Texas Inc. loan, she says, \u201cI plan to purchase inventory and save for future inventory.\u201d That inventory will consist of surplus of what she currently carries along with the purchase of a new line of items. She will obtain inventory in bulk so she doesn\u2019t have to purchase for months at a time. \u201cWe have people who purchase weekly,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use some of that profit to advertise in the paper for a couple of weeks; we\u2019re getting ready to drive in new business.\u201d Elite Hair & Accessories began in a small area of her home. As it expanded, she turned a separate dining room into a shop.\r\n\r\nThe loan should help her business grow by improving her credit history.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lhingneichong, who raised her hand in the picture, is 38 years old and lives at L.Hengjang, a small tribal village in Manipur, a state in the northeastern part of India. Villagers of L.Hengjang have practically no access to financial assistance, not even in the form of loans. Due to poverty and shortage of capital money, they are not able to take up income-generating activity.\r\n\r\nLhingneichong and her husband are a hardworking couple who have three school-going children. Though her husband works as a carpenter, his income is inadequate to meet their day-to-day household needs and the children\u2019s educational expenses.\r\n\t\r\nIn 2009 Lhingneichong learned about WSDS disbursing loans to women's groups in the neighboring locality. To avail herself of this opportunity, she, along with four other women of the village, formed Sarah group and underwent compulsory group training conducted by WSDS. On completion of the training, Lhingneichong and other members of the group received INR 5,000 each as loans. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she bought two piglets and with the remaining amount she built pig sty. Feeding her pigs involves a good amount of hard labor. She walks down to Leimakhong (market place), which is about 2 kms, to collect feed for her pigs. During day time she works in her small agricultural land where she cultivates potatoes, cabbages and many other vegetables for her household consumption and sale in the market. \r\n\r\nNow she wants to avail herself of another loan of INR 10,000 to purchase four or five piglets depending on the price. And by next year with the amount she gets from the sale of these pigs, she wishes to start a small general shop in the village. She is hopeful that with God\u2019s grace her cherished dream of having her own general store and providing proper education to her children will surely come true.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1216811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase four or five piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-10-19T14:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-18T14:30:07Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nengkholam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingkholam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-20T12:56:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":484443,"name":"Mehdad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mehdad is a 26-year-old single man who has been selling coffee and hot drinks for 10 years.

In summer, the temperature reaches 105 degrees Fahrenheit.  The main problem in the region is water for irrigation and for animals. \r\n\r\nHumbat is not able to a build a water channel for his garden alone. This is quite an expensive process which requires a labor force and special equipment.  He was extremely excited about water loans provided by AqroInvest, and applied for a 2000 AZN loan.
