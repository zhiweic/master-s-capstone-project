Her husband works as a driver.\r\n\r\nGladys runs a grocery store out of her home and sells a variety of products, such as rice, sugar, oils, detergents, legumes, sodas, water, ice cream and other essential items and bazaar products.  She works every day from 6:00 a.m. until late at night.  Her children help out when they can.  She has been in business for 11 years and is grateful to be able to grow daily, especially with the help of the loans.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to stock the store buying rice, sugar, oil, detergents, sausages and other essential items.  She has been a member of the communal bank for six years and and likes the fact that the loans have helped her business.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to continue working and seeing her children become professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1316845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy rice, sugar, oil, detergent, sausages and other essential items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Tosagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-04-01T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-01T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1158.32,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":289.58,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":293.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364526215,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":289.58,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:23:29Z","rounded_local_amount":293.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372926983,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":289.58,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":293.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381704041,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":289.58,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":293.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566465,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-01T22:17:07Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:14:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":540515,"name":"Fuerza 2008 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cFUERZA 2008\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\nLa socia es la Sra.

Elmer quickly learned the skills and techniques and became a pizzaiolo, specializing in carefully crafting pizzas.  \r\n\r\nElmer\u2019s work ethic comes from his motivation to provide for himself and his family.  As a teenager working in pizza shops, his hard work meant independence and the ability to start a new life. Today, Elmer is ready to take his experience and passion and start his own business, Coney Island Pizzeria. \r\n \r\nThe pizzeria has seen five previous owners in the last four years, but Elmer is determined to create a lasting community pizzeria. Coney Island Pizzeria reopened March 1, and Elmer is already starting to establish quality relationships with customers and new regulars.\r\n\r\nFor Elmer, making pizza is a labor of love.  His passion is creating quality pizza using the best ingredients, and his goal is to create a safe and fun community pizzeria for families.  Over the last 15 years, Elmer has developed arthritis in his hands.  Although very painful, it didn't stop him from doing what he loves to do and achieving his dreams.\r\n\r\nA loan through Kiva will enable Elmer to create a welcoming and comfortable environment for his guests.  It will also allow him to finish necessary renovations and updates to breathe new life into the pizzeria.  Elmer hopes to one day expand his pizzeria to other locations and share his commitment to building positive, fun restaurants in the community.\r\n\r\nAfter making a loan, make sure to buy a pizza from

For the past 6 years, Komiljon has been growing crops. He has a plot of land where he mainly grows wheat. In this planting season he seeded wheat, and now he needs mineral fertilizers in order to work his land. For this reason, he is seeking a loan to purchase these fertilizers.

Due to the increasing demand for her embroidery designs, she is hiring other women in her business. She has three children and is motivated to provide her family with the basic necessities of life including food, clothes and education.

She has been in association with Kashf Foundation for three years. Now she has requested a loan of Rs. 27,000, which she will use to buy one more buffalo, to increase her sales. Kalsoom hopes to get an increase in the production capacity of milk, which ultimately will help her to generate more cash.

Murad is a mother of six children and is motivated to provide for her family.\r\n\r\nAs she wants to grow her business, she requested a loan of Rs 30,000. She will use it to buy a stock of rice, of various kinds, from the market at lower rates. With this inventory, she will be able to meet the increasing demand, consistently. She is in her fifth loan cycle and has shown excellent repayment behavior. She wishes to use part of her increased revenues to deal with personal expenses, and part to increase her business capital.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":232.95,"image":{"id":1316010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a stock of rice, of various kinds, from the market at lower rates.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-04-01T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-01T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Murad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2123},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2185},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2249},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2315},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2383},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2452},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2524},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2598},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2674},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2752},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2832},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2913}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":2123,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2256.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364557378,"comment":null},{"amount":23.67,"local_amount":2185,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2322.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372955874,"comment":null},{"amount":24.36,"local_amount":2249,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2390.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381735596,"comment":null},{"amount":25.08,"local_amount":2315,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2460.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390822759,"comment":null},{"amount":25.82,"local_amount":2383,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2532.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399843082,"comment":null},{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":2452,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2606.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410117901,"comment":null},{"amount":27.35,"local_amount":2524,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2682.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419883149,"comment":null},{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":2598,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2761.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429531756,"comment":null},{"amount":28.97,"local_amount":2674,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2841.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439755576,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-04T15:44:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":539670,"name":"Nazia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Nazia is a 29-year-old married woman and mother of three children.

is 32 years old and lives with his long-term partner in Kompong Speu province. Together, they have one child who will be enrolled in school soon. Pao is in the business of farming rice just for an income, which hardly seems to fulfill his family's daily necessities. Additionally, he works to provide construction services with his team around the province. Due to the lack of a motorcycle for daily travelling and commuting, Pao decided to borrow a loan through HKL, one of Kiva partners, to purchase a motorbike for personal use.

","en":"Zarina is a health professional.  She works as a senior nurse in a hospital and helps sick people recover their health.  She is a kind professional who supports and treats her patients not only with medications, but with her words of encouragement.  She also always helps all her neighbors, friends and relatives.  \r\n\r\nHowever, a few years ago, Zarina's husband asked for a divorce, and she was left alone with two young children.  Gathering her strength, she learned to accept her situation and decided to move forward.  As a loving mother who always worries about her children, she works hard so that her family has enough and does not lack anything.\r\n\r\nLike any woman, Zarina would like to own some nice things, such as jewelry.  However, her income does not allow her to spend any money on things other than the basic necessities.  Having learned about the possibility of credit, she decided to use this opportunity to buy some jewelry before the holidays.  She hopes that MDO Arvand will help to make the dream of a simple and hardworking woman come true."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1313481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

He knows all the subtleties of agriculture, which allows him to sell his crop production at a good price.  \r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of his best efforts, Bibisho has not been able to improve his living conditions for many years.  For example, he has not been able to buy a computer for his grandchildren or an air conditioning unit for his wife, who suffers from the heat in the summer.\r\n\r\nBibisho has a large project, which he would like to realize this year, but for the realization of all his plans, he needs to get a bigger harvest.  This is the reason why he is applying for a loan, which will help him to buy mineral fertilizers for his land, as well as seeds to sow.  \r\n\r\nBibisho is relying on your kindness.

began selling car care products out of his home in Visalia, California in 2010. He established a route selling to car dealerships, used car lots, and other auto-related businesses in the area. In 2012 Joseluis started his own product line \"Prime Car Care Products\" which he now sells alongside his other products. He\u2019s excited to be distributing his own product and now he\u2019s even more passionate about making the sales. \r\n\r\nJoseluis gets the finished product directly from the manufacturing company, he loads it onto his truck and conducts sales. His wife, Adelina keeps the books and helps with the administration of the business. There are no other employees, but they plan to hire another sales rep as they grow.\r\n\r\nThis $5,000 loan will allow Joseluis to purchase a broader set of inventory from his manufacturer (which he has to pay for up-front). He had been turned down by several banks prior to applying with Fresno CDFI due to fact that he's just now getting his new product onto the market. This loan will help Joseluis build business credit and eventually access loans from more traditional sources.

He is 39 years old and he is married with four children at home.  With the goal of providing for his family's needs, he started his business growing crops and raising livestock.  He has much experience in this line of work and he is increasing his business.  He grows wheat, barley and other crops.  Kodir's wife helps him run his business.  He sells his crops to the local residents directly for a lower price than in the bazaar.  To supplement his income, he works as a teacher in the village school.  He has many pupils who are very accomplished and who work in various sectors of society.  Kodir wants to increase his business and use the income to increase his standard of living.  At the same time, he has no money to buy seeds for his new crops or to buy livestock.  He awaits this loan of 5,000 Somoni with great hope to buy seeds and livestock.  He promises to repay the loan on time.  He is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1323771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

","en":" Shuhrat is a 46 years old and he lives in a village with his wife and four children.  Neither Shuhrat or his wife have a higher education and they both are involved in raising their children.  In his free time, Shuhrat helps his wife with their crops: apricots, wheat and corn.  From a very young age, Shuhrat helped his family grow various crops.  A short time later, he rented a plot of land on which he could sow crops.  At first it was very difficult since he didn't have anyone to help him but his wife.  Shuhrat found from some acquaintances that Arvand give loans.  He turned to Arvand and received his first loan in 2011.  Shuhrat has a good credit history.  This year, he plans to take out a loan to buy mineral fertilizer to use in his wheat and apricot fields.  He is very grateful to Arvand for their support of poor people and he wishes every success for this organization."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":681.36,"image":{"id":1322527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Zuhriddin is the sole bread winner in the family. His parents are old and ill and are not able to help Zuhriddin. He has been cultivating crops and doing animal husbandry for more than five years. This year he did not collect a good harvest and that's why he was not able to save money for a new sowing. He needs to make a new sowing as soon as possible, but does not have money to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer. He also plans to buy cattle to expand his business.

She is 35 years old and married, and from this relationship she has three children who are 11, 9, and 3 years old. The two oldest children study in school. Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nLidia has a small button factory. With the help of previous loans, she bought what was necessary to be able to begin her business, and currently she has two machines that create these products. Every week, she turns over her buttons to merchants that then sell them to exporters in the city of Manta, who then bring these buttons to other countries to finish. She works from Monday through Saturday with the help of a sister to whom she pays a monthly salary. She has worked in this business for four years, and it is going very well for her.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan again to continue enlarging her business.

He has requested a loan of UGX  2,000,000  to put into the business to be able to meet his clients' demands. \r\n\r\nHis neighbors commend that Godfrey is a very hardworking, determined business man and a servant of God.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":581.25,"image":{"id":1311880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more cloth\/materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rubaga Road","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-04-02T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-02T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":169398.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993920,"comment":null},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":166666,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":169397.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040623,"comment":null},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":166667.01,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":169398.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831251,"comment":null},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":166667.99,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":169399.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689460,"comment":null},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":166665,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":169396.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480599,"comment":null},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":166667.02,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":169398.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879764,"comment":null},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":166666.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":169398.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983437,"comment":null},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":166666.36,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":169397.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635577,"comment":null},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":169398.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863057,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T00:02:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":542774,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles lives in Katyaza  with his wife and family of 3 children.

She works alone every day, although when she needs to go somewhere, her sister helps her at the store; however, this is only occasionally.  She has had this business for more than ten years, and this helps her to get ahead since her husband does not make a lot of money and they have a lot of expenses.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to stock her store with more items; she is going to buy supplies and items for the bazaar.  This is her first cycle with the communal bank, and she likes it because the loans are quick and do not have a lot of requirements.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue growing her business.\r\n\r\nThe small inserted photo is of a member that could not be present when the group photo was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6425,"image":{"id":1320425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy supplies and bazaar items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-04-02T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-02T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":6425,"lender_count":152,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liliana Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Gissela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Vicky Michelle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kathia Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Howard Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Angie Katherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Valeria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zunilda De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yelitza Antonella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lissette Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kenia Dayana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena Ateneida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6416.23,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":6425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":641.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":641.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":641.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":641.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":641.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":641.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":641.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":641.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":641.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1284.99,"local_amount":1283.24,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364526239,"comment":null},{"amount":1285,"local_amount":1283.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1285,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927007,"comment":null},{"amount":1284.99,"local_amount":1283.24,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381704065,"comment":null},{"amount":1927.49,"local_amount":1924.86,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1927.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566489,"comment":null},{"amount":642.53,"local_amount":641.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":642.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815521,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-10T17:22:46Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:31:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":542729,"name":"Uvumilivu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Upendo is in her early 40s and is married with a boy and three girls, all of whom are in school.

There have not been any huge changes since then, but thanks to that loan, she was able to buy a new shipment of clothing and to help her daughter, who is a student. Oksana says that last year was a difficult one in retail because the purchasing power of the local citizens was lower than it had been, and as a result, her income decreased. However, she is not discouraged, and has hope for the future. Oksana is seeking a loan of 21,000 Ukrainian Hryvnya to buy artificial flowers and wreaths.

","en":"Matluba is 40 years old, she is married and has 3 children.  Matluba's husband worked as an electrician, Matluba also worked but circumstances were such that they both lost their jobs.  Her husband decided to raise livestock as this brings in at least a small income.  Back then the children were small and there was enough money, now when the children grew up expenditures also increased and they try to work as hard as they can.  Raising livestock is the only source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nThey also dream of building their own house, because they live with their parents and it is very crowded.  Matluba does not want to sell the livestock because they can use the profits from the livestock to slowly start building their house.  She plans to buy more livestock for this purpose, so that her husband can resell it for a higher price after some time.  Matluba and her husband are hoping for loan help from Arvand to buy livestock.

She left home at the age of 18 to pursue her musical aspirations and to study clarinet and music education at UCLA.  She taught music classes in Compton, California, for three years while in school.  She noticed the large gap in music education programs available to students of color; they did not have any programs outside the UCLA students.\nTanitra\u2019s four year old son is a strong motivator behind her passion to create musical opportunities for the community. When her son started to play an instrument, she could not find a suitable program without driving through LA traffic.  In 2011, she started the Southern California Fine Music Center (SCFMC) to provide quality music education through on-campus music programs in the Inglewood Unified School District.  Tanitra also provides education through parks and recreation programs, summer music camps, and private lessons throughout Southern California. She has assisted over 80 low-income children in the city of Inglewood. \nNow, because she has more students, she needs to move her music school from her house to a studio in Inglewood.  Tanitra will offer regular community music classes that introduce families to the possibilities of a music education.  Because her business is a start-up, she couldn't get a bank loan, so she approached PACE for a Kiva loan.  She will use the $9950 loan to buy musical instruments and lease the studio. \nThe academy will offer classes for all levels of experience and ages, infants through seniors. SCFMC will operate two instrumental music camps during the 2013 summer in the Inglewood \/ Ladera Heights area, saving parents the long drive to other cities to enhance their child\u2019s education through music.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2016.25,"image":{"id":1325449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","use":"to

The youngest members work in the city, but their common goal is to help their families move forward and improve their economic stability.  These members have also maintained the culture and traditions of their people.  The women live in the canton of Sigsig, a place that is surrounded by lush vegetation.  Despite the rugged terrain, the beautiful scenery makes it a pleasure to travel through this place.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of this group is Sra. Elvia.  This is the first time she is participating in a loan alongside her friends and fellow group members of the \u201cSe\u00f1oras de Taguan\u201d Communal Bank.

The next two children are in high school and the youngest attends an elementary school in town.  Her husband works every day as a farm laborer.  They own the house in which they live.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Elvia stays at home and takes care of the household chores, but she also has a space set aside for raising chickens, guinea pigs, pigs, and cattle.  She also has tracts of land for farming, so whatever she produces is set aside for household consumption.  If there is a surplus, then she sells anything that is left over.  In the evenings and in her spare time, Elvia makes woven straw hats.  Her loan will be invested in the purchase of chickens and feed for her animals.  Her goal is to have a larger chicken coop so that she can raise more animals.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe smaller photo is that of a member who was not present at the time the group photo was taken.
