She lives in a common-law marriage.  Over the course of several years, she has made a living giving manicures and pedicures, an activity that she learned through a training course.  This work has allowed her to generate resources to move herself ahead.  \r\n\r\nPresently, she works offering these nail services at home.  She does not have an established schedule since her work depends on the demand of her customers, and working at home allows her to keep an eye on her son.  She would like to have a regular, fixed job in her home.  \r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is requesting a loan.  She will buy a chair for her manicures and pedicures, and a massage chair for feet and hands. She will organize the space where she offers her services and buy supplies wholesale (cuticle cutters, nail clippers, files, nail polish, nail decorations, and others).  This will allow her to continue working productively, but in better working conditions.

Her kids are her principal motivation for fighting relentlessly.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy stock items wholesale (chocolates, cookies, home products, sweets, Christmas goods).  This will allow her to stock up while reducing costs.  This will ultimately be reflected in an increased profit margin on each sale she makes, thereby improving her overall income.  Additionally, Sandra views this support as an opportunity to build customer loyalty and to therefore be able to sell a greater quantity of goods.

This is because her family was poor and everyone had to work so that they could eat. Her job was to sell candy on different bus routes around the city. She grew up in a commercial enviroment and thanks to this she has managed to set up a small stall that she holds on one of the streets downtown where she sells knitted woollen clothing and other items. She has been running the stall for 10 years and is well-known in the area. She has the advantage of being able to decide her own hours and can manage her resources. Her main challenges are the dangers she faces on the streets and the dramatic changes of temperature. Moreover, she does not receive any social security. Nevertheless, she carrys on working hard and, in this way, generates enough income to be able to provide for her family's basic needs. Her drive, determination and tenacity have led to to look for other ways to carry on improving and this is why she is requesting a loan to buy products at wholesale (jackets, balaclavas, scarves, gloves, and other knitted clothing). This will allow her to have a wider variety of items to sell and meet customer demand which increases during the winter months, and therefore increase her income. Sonia will continue to work hard to achieve her goal of selling her goods in a store where she will be more comfortable and will not be exposed to as many risks as she is on the street. She will also be able to improve her sales and give herself financial stability which will guarantee a better quality of life for her and her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy items at wholesale (jackets, balaclavas, scarves, gloves, and other wool products).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107094},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110058},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113105},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116235},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119453},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122759},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126157},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129649},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133238},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136926},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140716},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144610}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T21:40:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640623,"name":"Itagia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Itagia  is 43-years-old and married with seven children.

From a young age, she discovered that she had a passion for art, painting and crafts. For this reason, she took a course and started selling different decorative items for the home, such as figurines made of plaster and bedspreads to family members, neighbors and friends. Through this, she has managed to generate income to support her husband with the household expenses. She is a very creative and organized person who is dedicated to her family and her work. This has led her to request the support of a loan to buy supplies and tools (paintbrushes, fabric, thread, paints, plaster and ceramic figurines,etc). If she has these supplies, she will be able to create her handicrafts and satisfy the demand that increases during the holiday season, which means that she will increase her income and be able to carry on contributing towards the household expenses and be able to invest in her business. Margarita dreams of taking her business a step further by transferring her workshop to commercial premises where she would also be able to sell her products. This would improve sales and allow her to reach more customers, and  as a consequence would mean that she could improve the quality of hers and her family's life so that they can live more comfortably."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":32.67,"image":{"id":1480853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy materials and tools (paintbrushes, fabric, thread, paints, plaster  and ceramic figurines)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Amag\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T04:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T04:10:07Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65415},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67226},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69087},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70999},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72964},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74984},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77059},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79192},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81384},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83637},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85952},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88331},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90776},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93289},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95871},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98525},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101252},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104057}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.67,"local_amount":61264,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":63016.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440010069,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T08:31:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640507,"name":"Ruzanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruzanna lives in Norapat village of Armavir region.

He works in his own business, a vegetable store that he started several months ago as an alternative to earn his own income. The idea came to him when he was let go from a supermarket where he had worked for several years. He had various duties there, and among them was tending to the area of fruits and vegetables. That was where he got experience and it was one more motivation to start his own business. The business is located next to the supermarket where he used to work, and because of this he has the advantage of being recognized in the neighborhood, which gets a lot of traffic. He works there on his own every day and in this way he earns the income to provide the basic necessities for his family. He is currently requesting a loan to invest it in the purchase of shelves, a refrigerator, and to make some improvements to the store (paint it). This way he will give the business a better image and attract new customers so that he can increase his sales and the income he receives.

He worked there as a builder but with every year, it became harder and harder to feed his family. Several years ago, he and his family decided to move to Ukraine to the village of Vodyanoye. Here he began studying agriculture and learned from his relatives how to grow vegetables. Every year, his business grows and now he has several greenhouses already.   \r\n\r\nLast year, Lyova used a Kiva loan to install a heating system. That being said, he understood that for his quantity of greenhouses he would need a more powerful heater. Lyova is requesting a loan in the amount of 30,000 hryvnia to buy a more powerful boiler heater for his greenhouses.

His crops are of an especially high quality and he takes pride in them.  \r\n \r\nHowever, this year, Igor has been unlucky. In Autumn of last year, he installed heating in all of his greenhouses. He made a big investment in this. In the Spring, when everything has been planted, it became apparent that he had bought poor-quality tubing. As a result, the first four clusters of tomatoes had been lost, and with them, his main source of profit. This is why Igor is for the first time applying for a loan. With the received loan, he plans to buy new tubes from a reputable manufacturer as well as buy a plastic cover and seeds. \"I am grateful for the opportunity to receive assistance for my business.\" Igor hopes to fix the heating system and receive a wonderful harvest this season.

Yoreldis has had a business making and selling lunches for over ten years.  The business provides an income for the household.  Yoreldis learned this trade from her mother.  She also had a business like this but closed it due to family circumstances.\r\n\r\nTwo months after closing the business, Yoreldis and her sister asked around the neighbours to see if there was a need to reopen it.  Their response, and the responses of their first customers, were very positive.  The sisters have now been selling lunches and simple and special meals for four years.  They make the food to order.  Their customers are workers, who have jobs with carpenters, contractors, and in the neighbourhood.  Yoreldis and her sister buy the goods they need in the city market.  There they find the prices they need, which are very competitive. They buy in cash every day, working from 5am until 2pm.  Yoreldis' goal is to have their restaurant on premises separate from their home, so that the house will be more peaceful, and so that they can earn a lot more and pay for her children to study at university.  Yoreldis' biggest challenge is that she does not have enough working capital to achieve her dreams quickly.  Nevertheless, with a lot of effort and the will to to do well, she is gradually reaching her goals.  \r\n\r\nYoreldis is currently applying for her first Kiva loan through the Mario Santo Domingo foundation.  She will use this loan to buy six sets of tables and chairs, and an awning in order to protect her customers from the rains and the Caribbean sun.  With this investment, Yoreldis can improve her business' image and provide her customers a comfortable place to eat during this season when sales and demand increase, making her Kiva loan a success.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy six sets of tables and chairs, and an awning.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T14:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T14:50:06Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yorledis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1170000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":38269},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":51117},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":52651},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54230},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55857},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":57533},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":59259},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61036},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62868},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64754},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":66696},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":68697},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":70758},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":72881},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75067},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77319},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79639},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101369}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-01T18:50:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639817,"name":"Erasmo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Erasmo, tiene 73 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero por viudez, vive en el municipio de Choloma, Cortes.

She is the single mother of 3 children and a head of household. During her productive life she has worked as an independent merchant. She started by selling different products as a street vendor in the city streets. She learned that activity from a friend who also did that kind of work. Fourteen years ago, the opportunity came up to have a locale in a hallway full of retailers in the city center. It is very well known for the sale of a wide variety of books of all types. She has been selling this type product since then. She only works Monday through Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and in this way she generates enough resources to fulfill her family's needs, since all of the financial responsibility is on her. In her works she finds that there is an advantage in not having to be accountable to other people  and that she can manage her own time. However, she faces the disadvantage that she doesn't have the benefits of social services. Right now, she is asking for the loan to invest in buying merchandise wholesale (textbooks, literature, novels and more) to stock up enough to fill the end of the year demand and the next school year. This is when her sales increase, generating more profits and income. Mar\u00eda says that her main interest is being able to make her dream come true of having her business in a better locale, because right now she is on the second floor. Sometimes that is inconvenient for selling books. Nonetheless, she keeps fighting tirelessly because she aspires to seeing her children graduate from college and become honest and successful people.

She was not able to continue in school because of a lack of money, as her parents did not have enough money for her to continue to study.  Also, she had to move to another town.  Her father died when she was 8 years old.  Upon his death, it fell to her to take over responsibility for her younger siblings.  In order to support them, she used to travel to other towns to sell vegetables and to buy them food.  After some years she found a partner, and now she has 4 children, all of whom are involved in agricultural activities for every harvest.  Her oldest child is 17 years old.  He only finished 6th grade because he didn't like to study, and so it was best for him to work the land with his father.  They also have a 16 year-old daughter who also left school after 6th grade.  She works on the domestic household chores.  Their third child is 14 years old.  Like their oldest, he did not enjoy school and so left after 5th grade to work in the fields.  Their youngest child is 10 years old and is attending a local school.  He is in the third grade.  \r\n\r\nJesus de Navidad has 1 manzana (about 1.5 acres) of land which she and her partner obtained through a lot of hard work, as they both also work on other farms.  Everyone in the family gets involved during the time that they harvest the coffee.

This was very difficult to live through, but his son remained with him and was a excellent source of support.  Sergei is an excellent father and his son tries to emulate him in everything, and is in the very same business.  Together, they decided to develop their farming business.\r\n\r\nThis year Sergei and his son raised an excellent crop of tomatoes.  The tomatoes were very large and were notable for their quality.  Now, Sergei has decided to install a heating system in the greenhouses so they will be able to plant their seedlings earlier in the year.  For this reason he has applied for a loan.  With a loan of 25,000 hryvni (UAH), next year Sergei will be able to reap the harvest earlier and to sell it for a higher price."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1482862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase and install a heating system for his greenhouses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergei","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T17:09:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640710,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is 28 years old and married.

Znamenka. She and her husband have been running the business together for many years. They are very open, sociable people. They are respected and well know throughout the region, since they provide agricultural equipment parts to drivers from other towns. With their extensive experience, they know what part to send, so that the buyers will have everything they need. Recently Galina noticed that fewer agricultural parts were being bought, and car parts were in higher demand. In order to not lose customers, they decided to expand their inventory of car parts, using a loan of 21,000 hryvnia. The loan will really help Galina develop her business.

The land that she, her husband, and her children work is their own, and is located 10 minutes from her house, which she can get to and from easily on foot.  \r\n\r\nHer goals and hopes are that, through this financing, she will be able to buy the supplies necessary for attending to her crops, which are her means of generating income that she can reinvest and use to go on building up her children's inheritance so that some day they will have land where they can work, build up a life for themselves, and feed their children.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1481461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies to support her cultivation of staple crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-19T17:37:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639896,"name":"Guillermina Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Guillermina tiene  53 a\u00f1os y es madre de 2 hijos a los cuales quiere mucho y por quienes se esfuerza cada d\u00eda en su labor como agricultora ya que con ello puede tener ingresos para salir adelante.\n\nGuillermina esta agradecida con los prestamistas kiva ya que gracias a su ayuda podr\u00e1 comprar abono, fertilizantes, semillas, entre otros para poder mejorar su cultivo y sembrar nuevos productos, de esta manera tendr\u00e1 una buena cosecha y seguir\u00e1 esforz\u00e1ndose por hacer realidad su gran sue\u00f1o:\u201d Darle una profesi\u00f3n a sus hijos\u201d.\n","en":"Guillermina, 53, has 2 children.

She is 25, married, and the mother of 2 children. She completed school through the 3rd grade because she couldn't go on studying due to lack of financial support from her parents, who had scant resources. She is a young woman with many hopes of making something of herself. She is a clothes maker and, along with her husband who is a plant manager at a factory, she has a small micro-business using fabric to produce shirts, baby clothes, pants, overalls, vests, boxers, etc for all ages.    \r\n\r\nShe has been making clothes for more than 5 years, but has only been in business as a micro-business owner for 4 years. The idea started with a friend who helped her get 2 machines to make clothes and suggested that she make baby clothes for sale. Over the course of months, she saw the demand she was generating with the quality of her products and decided to launch her own business. She gives thanks to God for the results she has seen so far, seeing as today she doesn't just have 2 machines, but a whole variety with which she makes merchandise for sale at the local market to students, other stores, schools, and the general public.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to make her micro-business into a major business that is competitive at the national and international level, that is known for the quality, durability, and technique with which her products are made. As a mother, she also dreams of supporting her children and giving them the opportunity she never had to get an education, as today a university education is a requirement for social acceptance, getting a good job, gaining new knowledge and learning methods for growing a business, and in order to be competitive.   \r\n\r\nThis is why today she is taking out this loan to buy primary materials (fabric, variety thread set, needles, etc) for making merchandise in advance of the Christmas season, which she hopes will be a success.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1481394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to

She completed all but one year of elementary school.  She attended school through the third grade but was not able to complete her primary school education because her parents did not have the financial resources.  She is married and along with her husband she grows coffee, as well as chayotes, oranges, plantains and bananas.  She has a large family made up of four children; a girl and three boys.  The children attend school.  Etelinda  has a lot of experience with agriculture since she was interested in learning about it from a very early age. With patience and care, her parents taught her the proper techniques for planting and the maintenance required to keep the plants healthy and clean.   As a producer, the only things she has to worry about is that her crops could be lost due to a freeze (weather factors), infestation, or sicknesses.  Competition is not a problem for the sale of her products because she has customers that have supported her for many years.  Her crops are located on the same property where her house is located, so she can care for and maintain her crops personally. Her plan for the future is to cultivate a better variety of coffee which would allow her to compete in the national and international market. Her dream for her business and her family is to increase production, as mentioned before, and for her children to complete their educations so they can become professionals with college degrees and have better opportunities in their lives. The loan she is requesting today is for the purchase of agricultural supplies that she will use to take care of her crops.  This will provide her with a good crop and better income to support her family and her home. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1482076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase agricultural supplies for her coffee plants.

Edith vende en los cantones aleda\u00f1os a su residencia, sale a las 4 de la ma\u00f1ana a comprar, ya que a esa hora se encuentran frutas y verduras fresca y c\u00f3modas, aparte de eso le ayuda al padre a trabajar en la agricultura, pues el padre siembra ma\u00edz y maicillo ella tiene hora de entrada pero no tiene hora de salida.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando, es para comprar frutas y verduras, con el objetivo de mejorar sus ingresos; ya que podr\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00edas y aunque trabajara mas, pero est\u00e1 segura de que obtendr\u00e1 mejores ingresos econ\u00f3micos.\n\nEn un futuro se ve con un puesto fijo en el mercado, para no andar en la calle vendiendo y espera que su hija no sufra las necesidades que ella sufri\u00f3, ya que por medio de los prestamos podr\u00e1 lograr ese impulso que ella necesita.\n\n","en":"Edith is 21 years old.  She attended school through the ninth grade but due to her family's financial situation she cold not continue.  She is in a relationship and her partner works as a driver at a business.  Her daughter is two years old, and does not yet attend school due to her age. \r\n\r\nShe sells fruit and vegetables on foot, with a guacal (gourd bowl) on her head.  She has done this type of work for 11 years and learned it from her mother, who also does the same work.  Edith sells in the cantons near her home.  She leaves at 4am to buy produce, as this is the hour when the fruit and vegetables are freshest.  She also helps her father who works in agriculture.  He plants corn and maize.  She has a time she starts work, but she doesn't have a fixed time when she finishes. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to purchase fruit and vegetables, with the goal of increasing her income.  This will allow her to purchase more merchandise.  Even though she will have to work more, she is sure she will obtain better income. \r\n\r\nIn the future she sees herself with a fixed stall in the market, so she doesn't have to walk through the streets selling.  She hopes that her daughter does not suffer the way she did.  With the loans she can achieve the momentum that she needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":27.51,"image":{"id":1482115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase fruit and vegetables.

She had always been a stay-at-home mom and depended on her husband economically, but once her children were grown and working themselves, she took the initiative to find an activity to earn her own income. In this way she began selling merchandise such as clothing, shoes, lotions and perfumes. The first products she sold were given to her by her oldest son who lives abroad, and bit-by-bit she invested her earnings from those products into more inventory for the business. Her clientele also grew: in addition to selling to her family members and neighbors, she also had clients in the businesses where her other children work. In this manner she generated sufficient income to cover her personal expenses and to help with household expenses. She ran this business for 8 years, but because she lacked working capital, her business was interrupted.\r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a loan to reactivate the business and purchase merchandise in bulk (blouses, jeans, shirts, tennis shoes and other shoes, perfumes, games, etc.) and to pay off the remaining balance of a current loan. This will allow her to have a wide variety of merchandise to satisfy the demand which grows in the month of December. Her advantage is that she sells the name brand products her clients like, which increases her level of earnings. Bernarda, with her perseverance, charisma and good energy hopes to continue working in her business and continue receiving income to spend as she likes.

She is requesting financing to the cooperative COMIXMUL, with which she will be able to buy different types of fertilizers that will help her plantation to be in good shape and protected from weeds, insects and other.\r\nHer goals are to be one of the best coffee producers of the area, attracting customers to her business, growing in variety and quality and, continue expanding the coffee plantation through the purchase of more land to start a new plantation.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1482246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy different types of fertilizer to maintain her coffee plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T05:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T05:10:13Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-26T01:23:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640786,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 48 years old and married with five children.
