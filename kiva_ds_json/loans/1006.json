Landy was not able to study at the university level, but she would have really liked to study the law.  In her free time, she likes to go walking with her children through the warm and narrow streets of her city, and sometimes she cooks a dish of delicious Tacacho (chopped and roasted plantains) with cold chicken, which is a favorite meal in her family.\r\n\r\nBy her own initiative, and with a great deal of effort and dedication, Landy works at a small business that sells fish, every day she starts work very early in the morning, and she works on foot.  She works up to about 6 hours each day, and she thinks it is going well because of the kind attention that she gives to her customers.\r\n\r\nLandy is very thankful for the lenders at Kiva, since it is thanks to their help that she will be able to cover the costs of renting a small market stall in one of the marketplaces in her city.  In this way, Landy hopes to improve her business and increase her sales.  Therefore, she will be able to continue working and striving to meet her goals and achieve her dream of having a house of her own."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1231925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to cover the costs of renting a storefront.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:13:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:13:08Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Landy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":158.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":167.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":174.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":130.38,"local_amount":325.96,"processed_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":340.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089401,"comment":null},{"amount":69.62,"local_amount":174.04,"processed_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":181.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478934,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-01T09:38:21Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:20:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":493480,"name":"Raquel  Marlene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Raquel vive en la ciudad de Quevedo de la provincia de Los R\u00edos, tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad es divorciada tiene 4 hijos que asisten a una escuela p\u00fablica del sector.

Three of her children are currently in school while the other one is too young to attend school. To provide a decent life for her family, Et has been farming rice and raising pigs tirelessly, earning around 18,000KHR per day and saving approximately 8,000KHR after offsetting her daily cost of living. Et, a second-cycle client with VisionFund, is leading a group member who is just a first-cycle client with VisionFund to take out a loan in the amount of 400,000KHR and 100,000KHR respectively. Et comments that the previous loan that she obtained and successfully paid back has enabled her to meet her family's needs and buy some household supplies.

Rem is now in need of money to support her rice field. Thus, she is leading a loan group of two female members, who both have been with VisionFund for a loan cycle already, to apply for a loan in the amount of 450,000 KHR in total. The past loan that Rem successfully paid back has allowed her to make the family's lifestyle so much better, which makes her so satisfied. Now with her new requested loan portion in this loan, which is 300,000 KHR, Rem will utilize it even more efficiently than the previous one. She will purchase fertilizer to help keep her rice field in good shape. Rem has high hopes that she can boost her income with the help of her loan portion and use the income generated by the rice-growing business, to send her beloved sons to school in the future.

Chanthorn and her husband earn their living by farming rice and selling grocery items, together earning around 23,000KHR per day. Chanthorn, a second-time borrower with VisonFund, is leading a group member who is just a first-time borrower with VisionFund to request a loan in the amount of 700,000KHR in total. With the previous loan, Chanthorn succeeded in increasing her crop yields as well as boosting her income. Now hoping to earn more income for the family, she will use her new requested loan portion, which is 500,000KHR, to purchase fertilizer to apply to her rice field.

She has been involved in this business for 6 years. \r\n\r\nSeanghai's past loan was the original loan with VisionFund (Kiva's partner). That past loan, which has better supported her business as well as her household, has been completely paid back with success. Now, she is requesting another loan for 2,700,000 KHR. She will use this loan to buy fertilizer and pig feed. She hopes that she can make more income from her current business.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pearson group is comprised of five members belonging to a tribal community from Churachanpur, Manipur, which is in the northeastern part of India. In 2011, the group was formed and functions as a joint liability group to help one another.\n\nMuonkim, with her hand raised, is the group leader. She is a widow and a mother of four sons. All her children go to an orphanage school nearby.  The eldest son, 12 years of age, is under the foster care of her parents. Muonkim lives with her other three sons and her mother-in-law. Being the sole earner of the family, her main source of income used to be a small shop where she sold cigarettes, paan and the like. \n\nWith her first loan of INR 5000 and help from her parents and friends, she started a clothing business because she believed she was able to make more profits to provide for her family. Initially, she sold clothes door to door, but now with her second loan of INR 10,000 and with some of her savings, she was able to construct a small store where she sells clothes now. She named her store \u201cFlying Business\u201d and employs one of her nieces to run the store while she is engaged in bringing in clothes to sell. She deals in mostly ladies garments such as warm pants, sweaters, tops, T-Shirts and half-pants for kids. To be precise, she sells clothes according to the season  \n \nShe usually goes to Dimapur in Nagaland, a neighbouring state, to buy clothes for her store. She also visits Moreh town (Bordering Myanmar- 180 km away) for the same purpose according to the demands and convenience.\n\nWith great hopes, she plans to save as much as possible until her children come of age where money will be a deciding factor if she will be able to support their higher education. She said, \u201cI dream that one day my sons will protect and feed me. It is my responsibility to give them a good education so that they may get employment opportunities when their time comes. This thought and hope wants me to live another day.\u201d\n\nShe requested another loan to increase her stock of winter clothing such as sweaters, warm pants, tops and warm stockings for ladies as well as for kids. She plans to invest the whole loan amount on these items. \n\nThe other group members are also working very hard and conducting group meetings twice a month to share and guide each other to do better with their respective business. They all needed another loan in order to stock their inventory with the Christmas celebration and Thanksgiving looming ahead. The group members' income-generating activities include a butcher shop, charcoal sales, supplying fresh and organic vegetables in the market and a clothing shop. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1234295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":" To buy winter garments such as sweaters, warm stockings, jackets and pants for kids to sell.

In his new home, he has many household expenses related to construction. Abdurasul himself works as a programmer for a mobile phone company, and does not have any other supplementary income. For this reason, he has decided to take out a loan so he can cover his roof from the rain and cold. He cannot save up enough money from his salary, so he has come to Arvand in the hopes of receiving a loan that will allow him to do a lot of work on his new house. Abdurasul plans to use the loan to buy building materials to cover the roof.

Por que necesita obtener ganancias, para mantener a su hijo de seis meses y a su esposa. Actualmente, posee una vivienda que no esta en buenas condiciones, porque es muy peque\u00f1a y all\u00ed mismo almacena los insumos para el cuido del ganado y su deseo es construir una casa con sus respectivas divisiones para que su familia este c\u00f3moda. \n","en":"Joaqu\u00edn is 32 years old, married, and has one child.

Pablo works exclusively in agriculture, and in his free time, he does masonry projects around his home. It is in this way that he is able to maintain it. The last harvest had climate problems (frost), and in the last few days, the crops have suffered from water scarcity and irrigation problems. The plots of potatoes and peas have been performing poorly, and this is causing big problems for the income of a family that is supported by agricultural production. Each year, he produces primarily peanuts, potatoes, onions, and corn. Pablo is a very well-liked and respected person where he lives, dedicated to agriculture as the way to move his family ahead. He is asking for this loan to expand his home, and in this way, improve his family's quality of life. This will improve his family's quality of life by giving them well-being. There are many people who live in mud homes, which brings many dangerous insects into the home. The roof is made of straw, and when it rains the roof falls in.

Every year he increases his production of broiler chickens. This year he has added a shed that is approximately 450 square metres with a capacity for 1500 chickens. \r\n\r\nBenjamin is a responsible person who is dedicated to his work. He does the marketing personally in order to have a higher income, saying that \"If I hire people, they do not work the same as oneself\". He is not a member of any association because he has a small, rustic slaughterhouse to slaughter the chickens and he has a fixed buyer. As he mentioned earlier he has increased his production. Now he does not have the money for the next phase of production, for this reason he needs the money to buy animal feed for his chickens.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1236151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy animal feed for his chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:14:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:14:32Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benjamin Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125.02,"local_amount":850.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":863.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331103957,"comment":null},{"amount":124.98,"local_amount":849.89,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":863.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355790606,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1700.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1727.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382130952,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":849.84,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":863.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399792994,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":850.28,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":863.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419832990,"comment":null},{"amount":750,"local_amount":5099.72,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5181.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429487574,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T21:31:24Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T14:22:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496286,"name":"Sabino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Sabino, tiene 56 a\u00f1os de edad, su unidad familiar est\u00e1 compuesta por de 4 miembros, es de una familia humilde de escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos por tanto cultiva superficies muy peque\u00f1as, vive en la comunidad de Sauces del municipio de Mizque del departamento de Cochabamba.

Her goal is raising her profits, which she will save until she can buy a truck to use in hauling the products she sells, which will reduce her costs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1237023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more bananas to resell in the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dam Site Anonat, Mountain Province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:14:46Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:14:46Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":208.5,"local_amount":8340,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8577.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331917802,"comment":null},{"amount":83.4,"local_amount":3336,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3430.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339444212,"comment":null},{"amount":83.4,"local_amount":3336,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3430.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346996210,"comment":null},{"amount":41.37,"local_amount":1654.65,"processed_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-22T08:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1701.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357121936,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-24T08:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3428.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365679585,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T01:43:23Z","paid_date":"2013-05-24T08:41:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496835,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Anita is a vegetable dealer in the market.

","en":"Gulnora is 46 years old and is married with two children.  She is a hard-working and responsible woman.  While searching for a source of income in 1995, Gulnora started her own business with 150 somoni selling sundries (soap, powders, shampoo).  Because of her diligence, she has expanded her business.  Gulnora's husband is repairing their house and helping her with her business.  With the proceeds from the business, they have built a small and comfortable home for their children.
