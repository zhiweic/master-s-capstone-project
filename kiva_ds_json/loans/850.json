She says that her mother-in-law has a car and three times a week they get products sent from Cuenca that they then deliver to small merchants or stores in the area. She tells us that it's going well because they are the only ones delivering these products in their community. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy sausages for resale. She's been through 5 cycles and is the president of the village bank. She likes it for the help and benefits that she receives from the bank. Her dream is to have a refrigerated car.

This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and who are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the credit he receives, Robert will be able to start a new business providing transportation service to the Khoni District population. The income of the family will increase and they will be able to improve their living conditions. Along with the above-mentioned, the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1087144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

His loan request was approved in the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and who are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Zurab will purchase wooden materials and a polyethylene cover. He will construct the greenhouse on a family-owned plot of the land and grow vegetables and greens there during whole year. Zurab will sell harvested products on Kutaisi market. This will significantly increase the income of the family. Zurab will be able to create better living conditions for his son and himself.

The town is very near the sea, 20 minutes from the city of Barranquilla. There, he has a shoe cobbling business which generates revenue to support his family and household. He has a small travelling workshop that he rolls from his house to the main square where he works, and he is recognized by all the people of Puerto Colombia. \r\n\r\nJesucristo provides repair services for all kinds of footwear - he changes soles, fixes heels, dyes the uppers of the shoes and occasionally stitches them. He learned this trade at a young age, from a gentleman in St. Nicholas square in Barranquilla. His work provides him with enough income to live in dignity. \r\n\r\nJesucristo is currently applying for this loan, with which he will purchase materials and supplies for everyday use such as soles, insoles, rubber and shoe uppers. He will purchase wholesale to benefit from bulk discounts and build up a stock, which will allow him to serve his customers in a more timely manner. \r\n\r\nIn good humor, Jesucristo considers that with his name, he has no 'Tocayo'  (a word used to refer to another person that has the same name), and between laughter and jokes he says that people lend to him with confidence because \"Jesus Christ did not hurt anyone.\"\r\n\r\nThis loan is the first loan that he has taken with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, because he has many dreams as opening his own public premises. He wants to improve the organization of his business, and this loan will begin the path to his goals.

Four of them are grown and the youngest is 14 years old, attends high school, and lives with her.  Her husband is a merchant.  \r\n<p>\r\nDolores intends to help her husband, so she will use this loan for his business.  He sells clothing of all types.  Dolores says that her husband travels to the countryside to sell his products.  He works every day from 8am to 4pm and then returns home.  Her husband sells his products for cash, but he also extends credit.  His customers are well-known and trustworthy, so he is able to collect payments every eight days.  The merchandise is purchased in Guayaquil every 15 days or as needed.  Her husband has been in business for seven years and has done very well.  As a result, their family has been able to get ahead.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more merchandise, such as trousers, blouses, T-shirts, and children's clothing.  Dolores has been with her Communal Bank from the beginning and enjoys being a member because it has given her the opportunity to move forward with her family.  Her dream is to own a shop with her husband so that he does not have to travel far in order to generate sales.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1083244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy trousers, blouses, T-shirts, and children's clothing.

The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

39-year-old Sallay from Grassfied eastern area in Freetown, Sierra Leone. She is married with 1 child ages 23 years. Sallay's child is currently in university. In 2007, Sallay established her general merchandise business. She began her business because she wanted to improve her life and be self independent. She works at the business 6 days per week and 10 hours a day.

Local foodstuff sales is the business she understands best. \n\nAbibatu runs a local foodstuff business. She sells beans, groundnuts, rice, corn, and pepper. She has been running this business for 15 years. She works at the business 7 days per week and 12 hours per day. She does not have any source of income except her business. She says that the main challenge for her business is transportation to move the goods from the province to Waterloo.\n\nAbibatu has requested a Le 6000000 loan through BRAC to buy more local foodstuff such as beans, groundnuts, rice, corn, and pepper. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her child. In the future, she plans to expand her business and build more stores. She appreciates your support.

There she has a little general store and sells a variety of merchandise retail, such as stationery supplies, articles of silver, clothing, footwear, etc.\r\n\r\nHer entrepreneurial experience dates to 25 years ago when she began selling fried pies, fried foods, and fast food in general.  It went very well for her in this and so she planned to travel to a border town where she bought various articles, such as sweaters and bedclothes, at good prices; she sold to customers who had asked her to buy for them.\r\n\r\nSome time later she got pregnant and was unable to continue to travel.  She sought the help of a partner but the business did not work out and it brought her losses.  This is why she decided to study cosmetology, and when she finished her studies, she got a job in a beauty salon where she acquired a lot of experience for 13 years.  It went very well for her, but her husband got sick and she had to abandon this work to care for him exclusively.\r\n\r\nWhen he died, she was alone and she decided to generate income by selling merchandise.  She began to travel to the city of Medell\u00edn to buy merchandise, and as it went well for her, later she acquired her display cases and she stocked them.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is very highly regarded in her neighborhood.  Her main customers are neighbors, family members, friends, and referrals, preferably school and university employees, who buy from her to pay in negotiable installments.\r\n\r\nIn her business she receives her daughter's help taking care of the daily sales in her shop, which require her to be on duty all the time because she does business in cash.  They are very close in her family and her children and grandchildren are part of it.  She shares all the household expenses with them.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Eugenia has additional income generated from two public-service taxis.  She also does hairdressing when she can for steady customers who do not change their beauty service and who have confidence in her knowledge and experience to improve their image.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will buy merchandise for the celebration of Mother's Day, a time in which her sales increase and she adapts her offerings to the needs of her women customers, who buy cosmetics, clothing, footwear, home products, and stationery.  And this is precisely the reason for the success of her investment, the product of her Kiva loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1076090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy cosmetics, clothing, footwear, home products, and stationery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T14:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T14:40:05Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":179397},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":238338},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":243899},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":249590},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":255414},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":261374},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":267473},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":273714},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":280100},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":286636},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":293324},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":370741}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":422459,"name":"Proscovia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Proscovia is 37 years old and is widowed with six children, five of whom are currently in school.

She is the mother of three children who are 16, 24 and 30 years old.  Nidian has a general store where she sells a variety of merchandise.  She also spends part of her mornings preparing and selling lunches.  These businesses both make her income which has helped her to improve the well-being of her household.\r\n\r\nNidian's life as a saleswoman began six years ago when she started selling products through specialized catalogs.  Her business has slowly grown and she has bought display cabinets where she can display her products nicely.  In addition, she also sells sweet treats and cell phone minutes which makes her additional income.  She makes the most of the fact that she has 'captive' customers who visit her each day.  Nidian makes her sales for cash and on credit, after carefully weighing up her customers.  She acquires her confectionery products and the supplies she needs to prepare her lunches in Barranquilla city center for cash.  She buys the merchandise that she sells through her catalogs on credit.  \r\n\r\nNidian's goal for the future is to have larger premises which are dedicated to her business.  However, her biggest challenge is having enough cash funds to expand her business, respond to her customers and ensure she always has a well-stocked store.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use it to buy catalog cosmetics, confectionery and a larger volume of supplies so that she can produce even more food.

She received her severance pay and started her own business adventure, investing five hundred thousand pesos COP in the purchase of women's shoes.  She took advantage of the fact that she had friends who were going to a popular festival and needed shoes for that occasion, and that's how she started her business.

Her greatest challenge right now is that she doesn't have sufficient capital to respond to market demand.  For this reason she has come to credikiva.

She prepares and sells food in a location north of the city.  She came up with the idea for her business 6 years ago when she started selling snacks and breakfasts to a clinic located in front of her business.

Little by little she purchased more chairs, and improved her building space to accommodate more customers.  With the help of her sisters, today she is able to meet demand.

She makes lunches, cakes, and dishes with rice or wheat breads and vegetables, meats, chicken, and\/or pork wrapped and cooked in bijao leaves. She also has income from selling cosmetics. Her business follows a family tradition, since her mother supported her family by selling delicious cakes. Seeing the profit generated by this business, Marly decided to keep it going and has added the other items mentioned to maximize her business and offer the best selection to her customers. \r\n\r\nOn weekends she also sells stews or soups with potatoes and three kinds of meat. She sells these products to a business that pays her monthly. Her goal is to increase sales and continue to grow, but she has insufficient working capital to do so, and this is a continuous challenge. This is the reason she came to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for her first loan.

Liria makes income selling food products, snacks, meat, soft drinks, tubers and other basic household products that she buys daily, weekly or monthly, in agreement with each supplier.  She makes her sales retail and mainly sells for cash.  She has been running her business from her home for more than 10 years and it allows her to cover her expenses.

Her goal for the future is to separate her personal space from her business space and she works constantly in order to make the income she needs to achieve this.  Her biggest challenge in achieving her goal is that she does not have enough working capital to structure things in the way she wishes.  For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) in order to gain new working capital to use in her business.

Her business is selling products that she promotes through specialist guides or catalogs.  She started this business in 1995 when she stopped working for a company and used her severance pay to start up her own business venture.  She bought merchandise in other cities in Colombia and started selling it on credit in Barranquilla.  Although things went very well, she soon became pregnant and, on her husband's suggestion, stopped working in her business.  However, as her son grew up she started working in the business again with renewed vigor and a lot of life experience.  She sold products through different magazines which she was offered at her door and, as a result of her sales ability, she managed to increase her customer base and also her purchasing power.  Although she sells a small amount of stock, her business does very well because she manages to sell everything she buys, especially during seasons such as the one which is approaching when people celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day.  At these times of year, she does not have enough working capital to fill her orders in a timely manner and thereby strengthen her income.  In her business, Nuris' main customers are neighbors, family members and people who she has been recommended to.  She sells on credit and collects payments every two weeks.  She also buys on credit every 21 days.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Nuris' first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy perfume, cosmetics, clothing and general accessories.  This will enable her to fill the orders of her most faithful customers and she will continue earning a little more.  Her goal for the future is to have display cabinets, in which to display her products, and well-equipped premises that offer her and her customers a comfortable environment.  In this way, she hopes to make enough income that she can offer her children the possibility of studying at university and becoming successful people."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1084140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy perfumes, cosmetics, clothing and general accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1750000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":113079},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130690},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133740},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":136860},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140054},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":143322},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146666},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":150088},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":153590},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":157174},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160841},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":183896}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":422754,"name":"Junaline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Junaline is 28 years old and married with one child.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

She owns moto-taxis and is also a nurse by trade. Her husband is a teacher in a local medical technology school. She began her business with her salary when she was working at the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) around 2006. The profits she makes from her business are put into her savings, and also used for food and clothing for her family. Meanwhile, she has just been granted her sixth loan. During this period, this customer's business has worked well, despite the crisis on the horizon. Thanks to the loans from Hekima she has bought significant household goods for the family. This new loan will be used to buy a new motorbike for her taxi business. Moreover, she would like to see her children grow up healthily. The customer is grateful to Hekima for its actions to make poor women with low incomes more autonomous. It should be noted that the customer is holding her baby in the photo.

Su idea de incursionar en esta \u00faltima actividad naci\u00f3 porque vio la oportunidad de vender este tipo de productos, debido a que  su c\u00f3nyuge es t\u00e9cnico de aparatos el\u00e9ctricos, que gradualmente van siendo reemplazado por la electr\u00f3nica.  Posteriormente en el marco de generar mayores ingresos que contribuyeran al bienestar de su hogar, incursion\u00f3 en la venta de productos cosm\u00e9ticos mediante gu\u00edas  especializadas, lo que en la actualidad le ha generado m\u00e1s de 40 clientes fijos, que gradualmente refieren a nuevos compradores, haciendo crecer los pedidos. En su negociaci\u00f3n sus clientes al hacer la solicitud del producto entregan una cuota inicial del 50% y la otra parte la pagan a cr\u00e9dito en plazos que oscilan entre 10 y 15 d\u00edas.

","en":"Liseth is 25 years old.  She lives with her husband and three children, who are between 2 and 6 years old, in the town of Malambo, twenty minutes from the city of Barranquilla.  There she carries out two business activities which make her income.  She sells cosmetics to order and also sells electrical and electronic parts.  She decided to venture into the latter business because she saw the opportunity to sell this type of products as her husband fixes electrical equipment that is gradually being replaced by electronics.  Later, in order to make more income and contribute towards the well-being of her household, she started selling cosmetics through specialized catalogs.  She has gained more than 40 regular customers for this business and they gradually refer new customers to her which increases her orders.  When her customers request a product, they hand over an initial down payment of 50%.  They pay the rest of the sum on credit, making payments every 10 to 15 days.  There are some customers who do not have the money to make the initial down payment for their order, however, and Liseth needs to have a cash fund available so that she can finance her credit portfolio and offer her customers better terms and conditions.  This has become her main challenge as she doesn't have enough working capital to achieve it.  For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) which she will use to buy cosmetics from her catalog that are available at good discounts.  She will also buy electronic parts that experience tells her have an easier turnover.  She will also make the most of discounts which will allow her to sell to her customers on a better installment plan.  This will boost her number of customers.  In the meantime, she has a profitability on sales of at least 35% and an accounts receivable turnover period of 40 days.  Based on these financial indicators, we predict her business growth and that she will start being able to have the resources she needs to make new profits so that she can improve her home and thereby increase her family's quality of

She wants to continue studying and is asking for this loan to buy g\u00fcipiles and fabric so that she can make them.  She says that this way she can earn a bit more because she only charges for labor costs and what they pay is very little and she wants to improve herself by investing in the clothes and making her own business larger.\n\nMar\u00eda Rosenda is also in it and she tells us that she\u2019s made San Juan style g\u00fcipiles and also has woven fabric for many years.  She\u2019s single and says that she wants this loan to invest in fabric because buying it at wholesale the price is better so she will buy everything she will need for a certain number of g\u00fcipiles.  She wants to hire another girl that helps her so that she will work with her but to do so needs fabric to give her to work with so she needs capital to invest because she has much demand because she sells in San Juan and they ask for various colors and styles and she can\u2019t quite deliver so in order to earn a bit more she needs this money and she trusts that she will be supported.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1066642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","use":"to weave fabric and traditional blouses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Aldea Sacsuy, San Juan Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Rosenda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":1333.36,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1345.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283315956,"comment":null},{"amount":86.19,"local_amount":656.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":662.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850873,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.68,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":672.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551712,"comment":null},{"amount":176.31,"local_amount":1343.3,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1355.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377969,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-08T23:48:41Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":414102,"name":"Angela Josefina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora es casada, tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio los 4 a\u00f1os de educacion primaria, tiene 1 hijo el cual esta estudiando, se dedica a la talabarter\u00eda a la elaboraci\u00f3n de zapatos para caballeros, inicio este trabajo como operaria y hasta el momento lleva 6 a\u00f1os de experiencia, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo quien la apoya econ\u00f3micamente.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo qeu lo utilizara para la compra de una maquina industrial y as\u00ed mejorar su producci\u00f3n, ya que en el futuro quiere tener un mejor capital.","en":"\nThe lady is married.

called \"Barrio del Ahuacate\" because the members of the group decided to name it after the residential colony where they live.  This story is about Mrs. Roxana who is the representative of the group.  She is 27 years old, married to Lauro, who is a taxi driver, and has two children, Edenia and Cesar, who are in second and third grade.  She has been making and selling food for over 3 years.\n\nShe says she decided to begin this business because she wanted a way to help her husband with the household expenses and cost of education for their children.  Also, because her mother taught her how to cook when she was 13 years old; and, because this helps her economy and provides an excellent quality of life.  The loan will be used to buy goods such as chili peppers, tomatoes, onions, corn, cheeses, meat, oil, salt, rice, beans, etc. to continue making her delicious snack foods.\n\nDo\u00f1a Roxana says her goal is to grow her business, so she wants to build a place for a restaurant and buy chairs, tables and kitchen utensils.  She also intends to improve products and customer service so she can increase her income.\n\nShe is grateful to FRAC and the Kiva lenders for giving her this opportunity, and trusting and believing in her.

","en":"Yuberlys is 21 years old. She lives in the municipality of Malambo, very close to the city of Barranquilla, with her spouse and her 2-year-old daughter. There she works making women's sandals, a traditional business which started in her home, together with her parents, 7 years ago. It took its present form 3 years ago, because she gathered together all the practical knowledge from her parents and learned how to add embellishments. Later she was trained at the National Learning Service (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, SENA), an organization supported by the national government, and there she strengthened her administrative and marketing knowledge. Currently, her business is officially registered, since she recognized the importance of being registered with the local Chamber of Commerce, so she can market to other institutions and negotiate her prices with suppliers. On average, she produces 160 dozen pairs of shoes, and she sells them to stores at wholesale prices, and these in turn pay her within 30 days. In her business, she works with people from her immediate family, generating about 15 part-time jobs, in addition to many people who work from their homes decorating the shoes. Currently, she is applying for this Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, an organization which she got to know when it arrived in her neighborhood in a mobile office with commercial advisors. Her goal is to be able to acquire machinery to strengthen her technical infrastructure and increase the volume of sales, in order to gain discounts, and this is just what she will achieve with the purchase of leather, linings, rhinestones and other supplies to make new shoe designs and to continue on her path toward prosperity as expected.

That is where she has her sewing business.  This business activity is a family tradition that her mother started seven years ago.  For health reasons, her mother transferred the business to Claudia, who has been taking the reins of this small business little by little.\r\n\r\nFour years ago she learned specialized sewing technique for women\u2019s dresses and skirts.  She sells them to Christian clothing stores.  The skirts are elegant, roomy, and long, which conforms to the education that the churches give to the diverse congregations that are in Malambo.\r\n\r\nClaudia got married a year ago.  She has continued to be in charge of her business in order to help her husband establish the family\u2019s well-being now and in the future.  She also wants to fulfill her dream of finishing her college education.  She is studying the career of public accounting.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making clothes, Claudia generates other income through the sale of products by catalog.  She promotes her sales among her neighbors, family members, and study companions, who are her principle market.\r\n\r\nClaudia is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy fabric, thread, buttons, and interfacing in greater volume in order to get discounts.  She will also buy a machine to use to improve her productive times.  \r\n\r\nHer goals are to organize her shop and to even generate jobs, to complete her university education, and to have her own house.  While she works hard to fulfill her dreams, she manages a  30-day accounts receivable turnover rate while her inventories rotate every 5 days.  Her profit margin is no less than 16%. Using these financial indicators we project growth for her business.

married and has five children.  She has been involved in animal husbandry for 30 years, having started this business with a sum of 10,000 som.  Thanks to Zaryl's hard work, today her business contains two cows, two horses, ten sheep and ten goats.  The profit from sales of milk and milk products amounts to about 5,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Zaryl requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy colts.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued increase of domestic livestock quantities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1088838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase colts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Baetovo village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaryl","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":344},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":344},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":344,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16149.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285594,"comment":null},{"amount":344,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-17T09:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":16149.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938584,"comment":null},{"amount":387,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":18167.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012294,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-16T17:46:12Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:59:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":422797,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 45 years old and married with 5 children.

She has a sewing workshop in her home, which is her main business, and she also earns money through selling cold cuts, with which she adds to her family income.  She started her business three years ago with the purchase of a sewing machine, which she purchase with the severance that she obtained from working in the French Zone in Barranquilla city.  This is where she gained her most valued experience which she later turned into her current independent business.\r\n\r\nHer main products that she makes are sheets and bed linens, and she also makes a line of women's clothing.  On the weekends, she works selling cold cuts, which she purchases in order to sell to her neighbors.  This has gone very well for her. \r\n\r\nShe is currently preparing to receive a Kiva loan, which will be her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to purchase raw materials and supplies for sewing, and also will invest it in her other business of cold cuts to position herself with her customers and earn additional income which will help her household even more.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to have infrastructure for her workshop and operators, and to be able to reach a better marketplace.  This would allow her to achieve her dream for her son, which is for him to be able to undertake professional studies.  Her major challenge is that the space in her house is not sufficient to allow for growth and a more comfortable working environment.  With only her own working capital, she cannot achieve her goals for the future, which is why she has come for a Kiva loan.  The lender anticipates a successful investment as Crindy is an expert in the technical side of sewing and in the marketplace in which she operates."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1084193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase raw materials and supplies for sewing. and cold cuts to bolster her other business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Crindy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70062},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74807},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76553},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78339},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80167},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82038},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83952},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85911},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87915},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89967},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92066},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98223}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.29,"local_amount":70062,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":70741.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141269,"comment":null},{"amount":43.01,"local_amount":74807,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":75532.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101140,"comment":null},{"amount":44.02,"local_amount":76553,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":77295.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338754,"comment":null},{"amount":45.04,"local_amount":78339,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":79098.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395310,"comment":null},{"amount":46.1,"local_amount":80167,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":80944.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775116,"comment":null},{"amount":47.17,"local_amount":82038,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82833.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387100,"comment":null},{"amount":97.67,"local_amount":169863,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":171510.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130318,"comment":null},{"amount":50.55,"local_amount":87915,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88767.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519201,"comment":null},{"amount":161.15,"local_amount":280256,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":282974.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071042,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

According to the local government the family belongs to the subsistence poor category and they receive social assistance. Total average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris, including pension and social assistance. \r\n\r\nMirian requested credit for the start-up of a small dairy farm. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with easy conditions for country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Mirian will start up a dairy farm. He will purchase a milk cow and place it in an old cattle-shed, located in his yard. Mirian and his mother will start production of cheese and sell it on the local market to dairy products retailers. The monthly income of the family will increase by 200 Laris, which will mean 80%.

He has been working as a farmer since he was 24 years old and since then has been working hard without the need for a loan. Now he needs a loan for working capital because he invested the money he had saved into a cucumber crop. He has his wife's and his father-in-law's support in his business. He would like to have his products sold in supermarkets because they pay the best prices.\r\n\r\nHe requested this loan to purchase inputs and to pay for labor to plant a half manzana (~0.84 acres) of tomatoes. He believes that this loan will help him to cover 70% of the production costs. His plans for the future are to purchase two more manzanas of land and to increase his production. His goal for the near future is to generate a high yield from the tomatoes he's planting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1089291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase inputs and to pay for labor to plant his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T22:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T22:00:12Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gamaliel De Jesus  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":511,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":511}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":511,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308448952,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T04:23:29Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":423380,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase chemical fertilizer and pay labour costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T22:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T22:00:12Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1020,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-03T08:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":608940,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301327616,"comment":null},{"amount":680,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":405960,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308084853,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T04:16:01Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:43:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":422821,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva is from Guingona, Ozamis City.

She has a \u201cmiscellanea\u201d (a small store that carries a wide variety of goods) where she sells paper goods, cosmetics, perfume, shoes, and household products.  She started her business as a way to contribute to the household income.  She was selling clothes, and she gradually came to sell shoes.  With her profits she bought display cases, and now she sells a little of everything according to the needs, likes, and interests of her clientele.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is that she does not have enough working capital to respond to the demand in a growing market.  This is especially true during times like the approaching Mother\u2019s Day where there is a greater volume of sales.  Digna needs to be prepared for these times by having inventory in her display cases to impact her market and to have good sales.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the reason that she turns to her Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Digna will use her loan to buy merchandise, especially household items, to stock her business.  She will do this so that her customers will make purchases for this special day, and so that they will buy paper to wrap the presents.\r\n\r\nThe success of this investment stems from the fact that it will be used in the small business during a season of great demand for the products that will be offered in her miscellanea.  Digna will buy the merchandise in greater volume than she usually does, and she will qualify for special discounts.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1084211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise, especially household items, to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Digna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":42249},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45957},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":47029},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":48127},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49250},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50399},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":51575},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":52778},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":54010},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":58626}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.35,"local_amount":42249,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":44513.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101141,"comment":null},{"amount":27.57,"local_amount":45957,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":48420.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338755,"comment":null},{"amount":28.22,"local_amount":47029,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":49549.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395311,"comment":null},{"amount":28.88,"local_amount":48127,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50706.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775117,"comment":null},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":49250,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":51889.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387101,"comment":null},{"amount":30.24,"local_amount":50399,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":53100.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993955,"comment":null},{"amount":30.94,"local_amount":51575,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":54339.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130319,"comment":null},{"amount":99.25,"local_amount":165414,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":174280.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519202,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T06:17:16Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":422421,"name":"Erdenchimeg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erdenchimeg is 27 years old and lives with her husband and two children in a ger (Mongolian yurt) in Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia.
