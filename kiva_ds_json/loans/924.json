She has three children who are now adults and who she has helped to get ahead with the support of her husband by teaching them that with work and sacrifice, anything is possible.  Juana's home is located in the city of Caman\u00e1, a city known for agriculture, especially growing rice, lima beans, corn, and other crops.  There is also fishing and, above all else, there is great diversity in typical cuisine such as the delicious \"Chupe de Camarones\" (Shrimp Chowder).

Because of her parents' lack of resources, Juana only studied in primary school - though she would have liked very much to study at the university.\r\n\r\nDay by day, Juana works in her business selling bread rolls, cookies, sodas, and other items.  She works about eight hours per day as with the income from her work she can help her husband with the household expenses.  She thinks that her business is going well because she works with pleasure and above all else because of her desire to succeed.\r\n\r\nJuana is very thankful to the people who loan to Kiva; thanks to their help she will be able to make improvements on her home, especially with the plumbing as the pipes have leaked into the walls of the house, making the walls damp.

He overcomes the family's financial burden via working on rice farming and producing handmade flat bamboo baskets. Both businesses earn him about 23,000 KHR per day. For this cycle, Pum and his co-member are sixth time borrowers with Kiva's partner, VisionFund.

Her secret is to sell her crops in the nation\u2019s capital where she already has steady customers.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cPueblo Nuevo\u201d (New Town) communal bank and this is her 10th MFP loan.  She feels good working in her communal bank because she gets good advice there on how to improve her crops because they are all farmers like her.  On this occasion, Claudia will invest in the purchase of 7 sacks of pea seeds and 65 sacks of natural fertilizer for her next potato and pea crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1159540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and farm supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1525,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4004.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373528956,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-18T22:16:46Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:18:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":458551,"name":"La Nueva Esperanza 4 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rudelania is the coordinator of her group, La Nueva Esperanza (The new hope) 4, which is composed of five micro-entrepreneurs and located in the city of San Pedro de Macoris.

She has long been dreaming of getting involved in some type of business, but had neither means nor support before.  She loved looking after livestock since her childhood.  Zurafo has experience because she helped her parents look after livestock in her father's home.

She is the person who cares for their four children (two boys, 10 and 3, and two girls, 9 and 7 years old respectively) and also takes in laundry for her neighbors for which she\u2019s paid $2.00 per dozen.  His home is humble.  It\u2019s 35 square meters with metal sheeting walls and roof.  Currently only three of his children attend school.\r\n\r\nSince he was a teen-ager, Miguel has worked in agriculture growing corn in fields of up to 7,000 square meters.  He continues doing this kind of work with the objective of continuing to provide his family with food.\r\n\r\nSince February 2, 2007 he\u2019s been working in a private residential area in the city as a security guard.  He works a 24-hour shift and is off for 24 hours too.  This job allows him to generate constant income for his family which made it possible for him to buy the lot where he lives.  The distance between his house and his place of employment is about 20 kilometers that he covers by bicycle.  He does this considering that he saves $1.50 per day which translates to a monthly saving of $22.50.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s requesting from the Fundaci\u00f3n is to buy metal and cement to build the roof supports that will be the base of his house.  The ones he has now are wood and are greatly deteriorated.  With this investment he will improve his house because by building the roof supports out of cement the house will be more resistant to adversity and have greater durability allowing him in the future to build brick or concrete block walls.\r\n\r\nMiguel aims to build his house little by little.  He states that he always lived in a humble abode with his parents but he wants his children to live in a safer, longer-lasting house.  He thinks that in time and with the financial help he\u2019ll get he will be able to build his dream.  With respect to his family, he states that he will strive so that his children will study through high school with the objective that they will be able to get jobs above day laborers in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1159403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Its location makes it a link between the various Ecuadorian highways coming from important cities such as Quito, Cuenca, and Esmeraldas. Therefore, it is an important Ecuadorian commercial center; it is home to most of the country's livestock markets.  Here we find a substantial production of cocoa and other agricultural products.  This city has a humid and temperate climate; the temperature varies between 18 and 28 degrees Centigrade. Santo Domingo is home to the Tsachilas, an ethnic group that maintains traditions, such as in clothing and language, that date back prior to the colonial era.  \r\n\r\nJoffre is 42 years old and lives with his wife and their three minor children.  He started a business selling seafood 6 years ago.  He learned this business from some friends, and since he started he has been working several hours per day to make progress with the business.  In spite of his efforts, the income has not been sufficient to provide his family with a decent life.  Therefore, he is requesting a Kiva loan so that he can buy more seafood and reduce the unit costs of his products; this way he can generate better profits.

It\u2019s a city where one can disconnect from the noise of the city and appreciate the beauty of nature since its scenery is very beautiful. Tila lives with her young son aged 5: she loves him very much, and she would do anything she could to grant him a dignified life, regardless of the difficulties she has to face being a single mother and having to act as mother and father for her son. When Tila has some free time, she likes going for a walk with her son, and at times she also likes eating one of her favorite dishes, the delicious \u201cPicante\u201d. As she is not very rich, she has been able to complete the fourth grade of secondary school only; however, she would have liked studying Computing and Informatics.\r\n\r\nTila works every day as a cleaner in the municipality of her district. She works 8 hours approximately, and she gets up very early to leave everything in order in her house before going to work. She thinks her job is going well because she is a very responsible and above all very honest person.\r\n\r\nTila feels deeply grateful to Kiva Lenders, as thanks to their help she will buy corrugated roofing, nails and other materials to repair the roof of her house.

She will them be able to keep on working with great determination to make her biggest dream come true: \u201cTo open a clothes shop\u201d.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1159779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

The city is known for its beautiful beaches that are visited a lot during all times of the year by national and foreign tourists. In this place the majority of the people make a living fishing and in other sea related trades. \r\n\r\nHere Nacisa lives, whom is 49 years old. She is married and from this relationship she has three children who are already of older and independent. Her husband is a fisherman. \r\n\r\nSeveral years ago she learned the dress making trade in a local academy. She now has a small sewing shop in her house. She makes all types of clothing but what she likes to make the most is women and girls' clothing. During the back to school season she also makes uniforms. Everything that she makes is by orders that her customers make to her and sometimes certain shops in Manta request that she make garments, especially children's clothing, so that they can sell them in their shops. She has had her shop for ten years and she is almost never lacking work. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting another loan since the other was very useful for her because she urgently needed money to buy materials to make school uniforms. With this she also obtained good earnings that served her well since her husband had been sick and she could use these earnings for the doctor and medicine. Now he is better and if it had not been for her earnings she would not have covered these expenses. This new loan is to be used to buy fabrics, thread, buttons and other sewing materials. She has been with the communal bank since its beginning and she likes everything about the bank. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be in very good health.

She is a cattle breeder and breeds cows and cattle for milk and meat purposes. She has 15 years of experience in this field, which makes her an experienced farmer with a deep knowledge of the market and her customers' needs.\r\n\r\nBahar makes homemade yoghurt and sells it, as well as fresh milk, to her neighbors and local vendors. She also raises cattle for meat purpose and sells to the butchers in the settlement. Beef is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes like pilau and dolma. Her monthly income is 150 AZN. Her husband is also working; however his income as a workman is too low to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nTo increase her income and improve her financial situation she applied for loan of 1500 AZN. She is going to buy two cattle and one milking cow. This will be her third loan and she has a good client history.

Latacunga is a city located in the Central Sierra of Ecuador on the flanks of Cotopaxi, the tallest active volcano in the world, which has already destroyed the city three times since its founding. Latacunga has a temperate climate and the average temperature is 12\u00baC [53.6% Fahrenheit].

Due to financial difficulties Darwin was never able to finish his studies, however thanks to his entrepreneurial spirit he has been able to get ahead and earn a living. He works several hours a day building blocks. Unfortunately he has no way to protect all the material from the rain, which often damages the product. Consequently, he is requesting a loan from Kiva in order to build a small shelter addition and thus protect his materials from the rain and other elements that could damage them. In this way Darwin is planning to increase his production in order to earn more income so that he can save up and buy his own home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1158821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","use":"to

At 55 years old she lives alone, as her children are older and she is divorced. She began the business because she wanted to have a means of earning money, but without leaving her house. So it was that the idea came to her and became reality with the help of her children. After some years, and thanks to another loan, she has been able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nShe works in her store every day from 6 in the morning until 9 at night. Because she lives right there, she doesn\u2019t have any problem with the schedule. In her store, she sells essentials such as rice, sugar, grains, canned goods, cleaning products, snacks, etc. The business also helps with the rent, since she has a space without having to lease. Her greatest fear is becoming ill, because she cannot work when this happens. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to obtain a loan in order to be able to purchase goods \u2013 most of all, sweets and dairy products. She would like to be able to increase her sales and for her business to grow, so that in the future, she can remodel her house. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1161822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase rice, sugar, grains, canned goods, cleaning products, and snacks.

Today, Chincha has an incredible mixture of cultures, including a high Afro-Peruvian population, due to the remnants of its indigenous past and the influences of the Spanish empire. The city, along with others nearby on the Pacific coast, was damaged by strong earthquakes in 2001 and 2007, but it has endured, as it has for much of its history. As good Peruvians, the people really like their food, and one of the most popular dishes is the delicious Carapulcra, a traditional stew. Because of a lack of resources, Vidal was only able to study through his junior year of high school, but he would have liked to have studied to be a teacher.

For these reasons, Evodia Achick joined GHAPE and plans to use her loan to purchase wood for fuel, palm oil, rice, beans, sugar, flour, baking powder and other spices.  \n\nThru her business, Evodia Achick helps the community by providing fast food services for the busy, working urban dwellers. Because of the location of her business, her customers do not need to travel so far for food. She thinks this business will succeed because of its location, the high demand from the growing urban population and her experience in the business. With the business profit this loan will allow for, she will be able to provide for better clothing, health, education and a greater standard of living for her family.

is happily married and the family is blessed with six lovely children, four of them below the age of 15 years. She and the entire family are living in a two-room apartment house. They are living at New Lay Out, Nkwen, Bamenda, Northwest region of Cameroon.\n\nLots of challenges have been encountered by this lady such as the lack of adequate finances to start up a business and low income within the family, making it difficult to even take care of some basic needs such as education and health bills. Again, she lost her sister who was lending her a helping hand. She also had a motorbike accident and the disappearance of her brother to date. But her situation changed when she joined GHAPE.\n\nShe intends to use this loan in preparing her poultry farm, buying feed for the fowls, buying crates of day-old chicks, feeding trays, fowl vaccines, and drinkers (waterers). \n\nHer loan activity will help the community because it will improve on their nutritional needs, as protein will be on their tables at low and affordable prices. The fowl droppings will be use by women as manure for their farms. \n\nThe venture will be successful because of the high demand for fowl products, that is, chicken and fowl droppings. The profits will be used to cater to her children\u2019s education fees and hospital bills. She also will use the profits to acquire a parcel of land and to plough back into her business.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1164592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

He would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Rashid has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans and now requires a new loan in order to buy bracelets, necklaces, diamond earrings and gold plated bracelets.

Then he bought more chickens to increase production. \r\n\r\nHe sells the chickens in various parts of the town, but mainly in El Guasmo as that's where he lives. He knows the area well so he can reduce the risk of attacks from which he might lose his chickens. \r\n\r\nHe is happily married and his wife looks after the home. With the loan Milton plans to buy more chickens, quality feed, and material for repairs. In the future he hopes to open a large warehouse and sell chickens wholesale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1161929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy

In that regard, she just completed four cycles in this micro-loan program. \r\n\r\nThe major challenge of her business is low capital. This new loan must serve to supply her with 20 hair extensions. In the future, she wishes to buy a plot of land and cover her children's school fees. So she thanks Hekima for thinking about small entrepreneur.

Located in front of the local hospital, Jorge manages to get a constant flow of customers, including the employees of this institution, and the relatives and visitors of hospital patients.  \r\n\r\nJorge's main goal is to open up a new commercial location so that he can support his wife in her studies to become a medical professional.   Also, they are preparing their children for a promising and successful future.  At this time, Jorge is applying for a Kiva loan so that he can add new products to his business, including fast food, hot dogs, sandwiches and other products made from wheat flour.  To do this, he needs a hot dog cart.  With this investment, Jorge can take advantage of the fact that the hospital has potential customers who work there at all hours of the night and day who need food, and he will have the nearest food business.  This is precisely the reason why this Kiva loan will be successful. This is the first loan that Jorge will take from the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, and with this organization he plans to grow his business even more.

de 19 a\u00f1os de edad, desde hace menos de dos a\u00f1os es la propietaria de un caf\u00e9 internet, donde ofrece acceso a las redes, servicio de fotocopiaje, escaneo y llamadas a celulares; su negocio ubicado en el municipio de Galapa, poblaci\u00f3n \u00e1rea metropolitana de la ciudad de  Barranquilla. Billy quiere mejorar la oferta de servicios a sus clientes, pero  aunque cuenta con m\u00f3dulos disponibles, no tiene  computadores para ubicarlos en ese espacio y su clientela muchas veces se va, porque no logra la soluci\u00f3n a sus necesidades de comunicaci\u00f3n en el ciberespacio. Para Billy el insuficiente capital de trabajo para hacer esta inversi\u00f3n es su mayor desaf\u00edo, esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 un nuevo computador  y con ello empezar\u00e1 poco a poco  a responder a las necesidades de su clientela. Billy es muy trabajadora, ella da apertura a su negocio desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 10 de la noche; sus compras las realiza de contado y a cr\u00e9dito en las papeler\u00eda de la ciudad de Barranquilla y sus ventas son de estricto contado y dependen del tiempo en el cual utilice su cliente su equipamiento y acceda al internet. Billy sue\u00f1a con tener un local mucho m\u00e1s amplio y bien acondicionado, para ofrecer m\u00e1s confort a su clientela, que bien se lo merece y eso es justamente a lo que ella quiere llegar.  ","en":"Billy, 19, has owned an Internet Caf\u00e9 for less than two years.  He offers network access, photocopying services, scanning and mobile phone calls.  His business is located in the municipality of Galapa, a town in the Barranquilla metropolitan area.  \r\n\r\nBilly wants to improve the services he offers customers.  Even though he has available modules, he lacks the computers to put into them and customers often leave because they can\u2019t satisfy their need to connect to cyberspace.  \r\n\r\nFor Billy, insufficient working capital is his greatest challenge and the reason why he\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, his first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy a new computer and start to better respond to customer demand.\r\n\r\nBilly is very hardworking.  The business is open from 8 in the morning until 10 at night.  Purchases are cash and credit in a stationery shop in Barranquilla and sales are strictly cash and depend on how long the customer uses the equipment to access the Internet.  Billy dreams with having a more spacious, well-equipped locale to offer more comfort to customers; it\u2019s something that\u2019s more than deserved and precisely the goal to reach.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1163413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a new computer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Galapa-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-16T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-15T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Billy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74501},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82229},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":84147},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86111},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88120},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90176},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":92280},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94433},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96637},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":98892},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101199},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":111275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.33,"local_amount":74501,"processed_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":75665.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775396,"comment":null},{"amount":582.67,"local_amount":1025499,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1041522.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497490,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-18T07:38:32Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:37:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":459202,"name":"Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia es la Sra.

Now she is requesting a loan with VisionFund of US$1,000. With this loan, she is going to purchase a motorcycle for her children to use to commute to their workplace. She hopes this loan will enable her children to save some time in traveling back and forth to work so they can help with the family\u2019s business and housework.
