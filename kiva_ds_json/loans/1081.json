It was her parents who showed her at a young age how to sow and cultivate coffee, which she continues to this day as it is another means of earning an income for her family to cover needs such as the basic grocery basket, clothing, medicine and so on. Orbelina also makes her living in sales, setting up a small grocery store which she saw as necessary given that the demand in the field is low in the area in which she lives. Thanks to the effort put in by her husband and herself, they were able to purchase a plot of land at 1.5 km for their home which they get to on foot. Her coffee product is bought by neighbors, middlemen who come to the area where she lives to purchase it.\r\n\r\nOrbelina is currently seeking help to buy fertilizers, manure and irrigation pumps for her coffee plantations as it is through this mean that she will be able to better care for her product and keep it free from infestations and illnesses such as rust which damages this crop.\r\nOrbelina's dream is that her crops are the most productive and best sold as it is in this way that she will generate an income for her family and give her children a better education so that

They have two children who are still studying. Rosa currently lives with her husband and children in the Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n parish in Santo Domingo, the main city of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province, an area which has very strong commerce as it has become a terrestrial port for trade between the mountains and the coast in Ecuador. In addition, domestic and foreign tourists have strengthened the activities of the entrepreneurs who set up their business around the city several years ago. This city is the third most populated in the region and it also contributes to activities such as agriculture, cattle rearing, fishery and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nFor the last four years, Rosa has been making her living in agriculture. She learnt this honorable trade from her parents who were also farmers. She spends a lot of her time in the mornings and the afternoons alternating between the household chores. She is always caring for her crops, watering, cleaning, harvesting and sowing in order to offer the goods to her customers at good prices.\r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacle that Rosa has faced is the difficulty in authenticating the land in which she works. However, she has continued to work hard to support the household and support her children's education. Rosa has been a customer of the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for four years and she has had a lot of openings with the 3 loans she has taken out. Rosa is very satisfied with the agility and support given to micro-entrepreneurs in the rural sector, as it is only in this manner that she has been able to keep the farm and her crops in such good condition.\r\n\r\nRosa now needs a loan which she will use to repair the internal and external infrastructure of her home and also buy fertilizers for the upkeep of her crops. Rosa thanks everyone who has been financing her growth on a personal and work front via Kiva.

However, the land on which she grows the crops does not belong to her so she must share the profits she makes with the land owner.  The maintenance and technical support required by the crops is the responsibility of her family and Carlota works together with her children who help her to cut, prune, spread manure and fertilize.  The produce is then sold in the local market.  It is bought by local consumers.  However, some is also sold to third parties who re-sell it.  \r\n\r\nCarlota currently needs help so that she can buy certified plants and seeds to grow.

He lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, with his wife, his retired mother and a daughter. Gocha requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGocha and his wife and daughter are all sellers at the big local market and they get small monthly salaries. Gocha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Gocha will purchase men's shoes at wholesale prices to resell them afterward with a price markup.

For the past two years, Justine has been working hard to manage her bar business, which sells local brew. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Justine has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more millet and sorghum for making the brew, and it will help Justine to generate greater profits and own more local bars around the center. Justine hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nJustine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Getrude is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kaliro in Uganda. For the past three years, Getrude has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells rice, sugar and biscuits. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Getrude has requested a loan of 450,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more commodities such as sugar and rice to sell, and it will help Getrude to generate greater profits and start a poultry farm. Getrude hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nGetrude is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

fiscal, su motivaci\u00f3n de cada d\u00eda es mantener y darles sus estudios para que un d\u00eda se conviertan en profesionales y obtengan el t\u00edtulo que ella nunca pudo tener debido a que los reducidos recursos econ\u00f3micos de sus  padres solo alcanzaron para que ella termine la primaria. \nMartha reside exactamente en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde un lugar hist\u00f3rico de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. \nAprovechando que Santo Domingo es el puerto que une a las Regiones Costa y Sierra del Ecuador, varias personas han establecido negocios de todo tipo para conseguir los ingresos que sirven mantener los gastos del hogar. \u00c9ste es el caso de Martha que en busca de cubrir las necesidades de su hogar decidi\u00f3 emprender con la venta ambulante de ropa casual desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, actividad que la aprendi\u00f3 en anteriores trabajos; invierte al menos 4 horas al d\u00eda, pues tambi\u00e9n debe estar pendiente de alimentar y ayudar en las tareas a sus 3 hijos.

She is a single mother of three children that go to a state-run school. Her main motivation is to give them a good education so that they can become professionals and receive a degree, something she could not do herself because her parents lacked the resources to support her studies after primary school.\r\n\r\nMartha lives in Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, a historical site in Santo Domingo, which is the capital city of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province, in Ecuador. This province has grown steadily during the last few years. Its capital city is well-known for its fruits and cuisine. It also has important commercial activities and has become an important hub for commercial exchange between the mountain and coastal areas of the country. It also has numerous touristic sites that together with its warm climate attract local and foreign tourists.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of Santo Domingo\u2019s location between the mountains and the coast, people has started all kinds of businesses in order to make a living and support their families. This is Martha\u2019s case, who, with the intention to cover her home\u2019s expenses, decided to start selling clothes as a street vendor two years ago. She learned this activity from her previous jobs and works at least four hours per day, since she also has to cook for her three children and help them with their homework.\r\n\r\nMartha has to walk her city\u2019s long streets, taking and delivering orders, collecting the money and offering the clothes she has in stock. This is why she decided to improve her working tools and buy a motorcycle with the first loan she receives from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa. With a motorcycle, Martha will be able to shorten her travelling time and reach more customers. This will result in an increase in her income and a better support for her children. Martha wants to thank each and every person that, wherever in the world they might be, decided to join her through Kiva in this quest for growth."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1160.84,"image":{"id":1317495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy a motorcycle to deliver her merchandise to her customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-21T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-20T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1584.6,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":122.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":123.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":127.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":128.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":131.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":134.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":136.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":139.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":142.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":144.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":148.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.81},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.3,"local_amount":105.28,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":106.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524934,"comment":null},{"amount":123.6,"local_amount":122.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":123.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133238,"comment":null},{"amount":125.09,"local_amount":123.88,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313777,"comment":null},{"amount":128.34,"local_amount":127.11,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":128.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565382,"comment":null},{"amount":130.08,"local_amount":128.83,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":130.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814421,"comment":null},{"amount":132.65,"local_amount":131.37,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":132.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320594,"comment":null},{"amount":135.81,"local_amount":134.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":135.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856284,"comment":null},{"amount":137.95,"local_amount":136.62,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":137.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059860,"comment":null},{"amount":141.02,"local_amount":139.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:46Z","rounded_local_amount":141.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995206,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-21T19:18:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":540468,"name":"Yudith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

This municipality was selected to participate in a pilot program to improve local training with respect to sanitation issues in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nShe is 27 years old, and she is a state worker earning low income as a teacher.  She teaches in an area known as Pacayita, which is where Margarita travels every day.  Her family is comprised of her husband and her minor daughter.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying to participate in a water and sanitation project, which includes obtaining a loan for the installation of an affordable sanitation system. This includes the installation of a conventional toilet with the construction of the Bio-San 1 system.  This consists of the utilization of a 600 Its Biodigestor tank.  This will provide better treatment of the waste water, and it will have an absorption well where the sanitized water will go.  This will contribute greatly to the environment.\r\n\r\nThis setup is required because the place where she lives does not have access to sewer lines. For this reason, her family has been using a latrine. Her family is one of thousands who do not have access to improved sanitation. This project will benefit several municipalities across Nicaragua.  It will allow them to have a better quality of life and to also contribute to the environment. \r\n\r\nWithout the opportunity of this loan, it would be impossible for Margarita to have access to a toilet because they are very expensive.  With her low salary it is impossible to manage to install one.  These programs come to help families living in the poorest conditions.  The latrines cause illnesses and contaminate the environment.  That is why the idea was born to create solutions intended for the poorest

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How to acquire agricultural asset like dairy cow from an MFI to boost production.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Selly replied: 'Acquire a high-yielding animal to boost production.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Selly owns the following: 'cow, poultry,' but does not own: 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards, based on this loan. This borrower does not have in the household: 'mosquito net, electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD.'\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":265.93,"image":{"id":1316456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy and insure a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-03-21T17:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-20T17:20:16Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2752.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2824.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2899.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2976.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3054.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3135.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3218.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3303.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3390.32},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3480.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3572.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3763.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3863.32},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3965.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4070.32},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4177.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4287.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.47,"local_amount":9856.9,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10149.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820051,"comment":null},{"amount":67.57,"local_amount":5622.22,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5788.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417167,"comment":null},{"amount":27.16,"local_amount":2259.72,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980698,"comment":null},{"amount":21.87,"local_amount":1819.46,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1873.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880670,"comment":null},{"amount":30.86,"local_amount":2567.55,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2643.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529312,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-21T19:19:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":540492,"name":"Salustiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

is a 36-year-old man from Taiz, Yemen. He is married and has two children. He is someone who dreams for his children to have a comfortable life. He has been operating a small grocery store. He spends all his time working in his business.

This town is located in the Western Highlands, about 45 minutes from Guatemala\u2019s second largest city, Quetzaltenango. Most of the population is involved in some form of commercial venture.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank has 18 members and is in their third loan cycle. Their average age is 38 years with three of the members being single and the rest being married. The married women have an average of four children each. The income that these ladies earn enables them to provide a better standard of living, health and education for their children.\r\n\r\nAna, 35 years of age, is the treasurer of the trust bank. She is married and has three children who range in age from five to fourteen and each of them attends school. Ana is in her 2nd loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and her business consists of weaving textiles, either colorful \u201chuipiles\u201d, the rectangular shirts that the indigenous women wear, or \u201ccortes\u201d, which are their skirts. Ana needs to secure a loan to buy two looms so that she can increase production. She has sixteen employees (8 women and 8 men) who are excellent workers, especially at this time of the year. In Guatemala, Easter is a big and very popular holiday and as such, families like to purchase new clothes. Ana is well aware of this increased demand and has increased production. The increased earnings will be well used. In addition, Ana owns a stall at the lively market in Totonicapan, a large community that is near her village, where people sell textiles.\r\n\r\nThe 18 women of the trust bank, \u201cGavitas de Chuisuc\u201d, are amazed, pleased and grateful, that they have received financial support in the form of loans from people that they don\u2019t know.\r\nThese ladies have a desire to overcome obstacles and move forward. With their loans, they can transform their own lives, as well as elevate the standard of living for their families and communities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4620.57,"image":{"id":1315601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy two looms for her weaving business.

lives in the Likoni area of Coast Province, Kenya. He is married and has five children. He owns a crop farm business where he sells cereals. He has been operating this for twenty years. He began from a small-sized farm, mainly dealing in subsistence farming. This has now grown into commercial farming including fruit and horticultural farming. \r\n\r\nNelson learnt about Milango through friends, who invited him to the group. He joined with the aim of accessing credit in order to improve his business operations. The main challenge has been the harsh climatic conditions, and lack of funds, a problem he sees as being partly solved by this loan. \r\n\r\nNelson is applying for a loan of 67,900 Kenya Shillings to buy farm inputs like seeds and fertilizers, and to pay for ploughing and planting labour costs. He would also like to invest into bee keeping. His extra income from the loan will be added to his savings in order to expand the business. His dream is to see his business grow by increasing the size of his acreage, and to be able to sell more to contribute to food security in the area.

She lives with her parents-in-law. Neyda has been working in a variety of jobs for a long time, but for a while now she has been selling furniture. She buys furniture wholesale at different carpentry workshops, transports them to her house where her shop is located and distributes the furniture on credit which she then collects each week or fortnight depending on her clients' circumstances. She has been working in this way for more than 3 years and she has the support and assistance of her husband as they began this business together as an opportunity for a better quality of life. What she likes about her job is that she finds it fun to work with her husband, and she is also able to use her free time to look after her children. Her business is going well because she sells high-quality products and she is now in demand with her clients. This is why she wants to strengthen her business and begin to create her own carpentry workshop where she can make furniture with the help of her husband and others. This is her fifth loan with Kiva, and that is why she is grateful for this financial support which allows her to continue with her work. She is committed to making her repayments punctually. With the requested amount of 1500 soles, she will buy some carpentry tools such as chisels and manual polishers. She will also buy wood in order to start making the furniture which she will later sell.

","en":"Sonia, 34, lives with her husband and her two children, ages 10 and 16.  Three years ago, to support the well-being of her household, she decided to generate income with a business in which she sells a variety of merchandise, using catalogues to promote the articles she sells.  She sells on credit to a group of customers she has organized who buy from her all the time now.\r\n\r\nHer niece is the leader of the brand of products she sells.  She introduced her to the business and little by little she has managed to get a foothold.  She makes her purchases every 21 days, when she pays her bills for the previous month.\r\n\r\nCurrently she needs to have available cash to increase the volume of purchases of articles with special discounts that she needs to have in stock to be more competitive.  This is why she's asking for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nWith her loan she'll buy costume jewelry, perfume, and cosmetics as well as clothing and footwear.  With the investment from Kiva she'll be able to increase her capital and have cash to respond effectively to her customers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1008.95,"image":{"id":1315708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy costume jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, clothing, and footwear","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-03-21T20:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-20T20:20:01Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":177098},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":187064},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":191429},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":195895},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200466},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":205144},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":209931},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":214829},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":219842},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":224971},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":230221},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":243110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.17,"local_amount":177098,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:58:30Z","rounded_local_amount":179433.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527939,"comment":null},{"amount":104.76,"local_amount":187064,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":189531.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928684,"comment":null},{"amount":107.2,"local_amount":191429,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":193953.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705832,"comment":null},{"amount":109.7,"local_amount":195895,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":198478.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968121,"comment":null},{"amount":112.26,"local_amount":200466,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":203110.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817314,"comment":null},{"amount":114.88,"local_amount":205144,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-26T08:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":207849.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323587,"comment":null},{"amount":117.57,"local_amount":209931,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":212699.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082821,"comment":null},{"amount":120.3,"local_amount":214829,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":217662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062188,"comment":null},{"amount":123.11,"local_amount":219842,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":222741.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731884,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-26T14:27:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":540003,"name":"Rodelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodelia is 39 years old, married, and blessed with one child.

One of them is in kindergarten, the other is a newborn. Ludim had to stop going to school after 4th grade as her parents could not afford to continue sending her to school. They showed her how to farm when she was very young; planting and cultivating coffee was her family's only source of income, and allowed them to pay for basic needs - such as food, clothing, medicine. Her parents inherited the land that she works with her husband; the land provides for them. It is located 4 kilometers from her house but she and her husband walk there and back every day. At this time, she is asking for a loan to purchase fertilizer, herbicide and compost to protect the coffee from blight and diseases that spoil the crops; if the coffee is not treated on time, the whole crop is lost. Her dream is that her children will be able to get an education so that they can have a better life and future, and so they can take advantage of opportunities in the future that may arise. She also hopes to keep increasing her output so she can have a better income since her family relies on this work alone to survive and get ahead."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1317722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer, herbicide and compost to cultivate coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-03-21T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-20T22:10:06Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ludim Sarai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-21T23:44:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":539589,"name":"Chantha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A married woman living in a rural village located in the Kror Kor district of Pursat province, Chantha is 28 years old and has three children; two are in school, while the remaining one is still too young for school.

Marlith mostly works on her own, though for some of her catering needs, her mother and children will assist her with washing dishes, prepping food and receiving payments from customers. Marlith has been selling her food dishes and products at a stand on the sidewalk outside her home for the past eight years, and she always works hard to provide high quality food for her customers.\r\n\r\nThe aspects that Marlith likes best about her job are the conversations she gets to have each day with her clients, as those interactions help make long work days seem much shorter. In the future, she hopes to build her own store for selling food dishes and offering improved services to her clients. This is her third Kiva loan, and she is very grateful for the financial support she has received to help make her business and dreams a reality.

This group has participated in various loan cycles at the institution. The group's name was chosen by one of the group's members, Adriana, who called it \"Haana\" because that is the name of one of her daughters. Adriana was one of the founding members of the group.  \n\nGroup member Vero is 33 years old and has been married to Victor Manuel for 12 years. Together they have formed a family in which they have two children, one of which is studying. Vero has had a taco restaurant called \"Fernanda\" for the last two years. She says, \"we started the taco restaurant because my father-in-law made a living selling head tacos, and my husband was always helping and that's how he learned to make tacos.\" \n\nVero says that they used to have a grocery store, but they had to close it because they did not earn as much income as before and it was difficult to recoup their losses.  But she also says, \"Every weekend we sold tacos outside of the grocery store and we sold a lot.\"  That was the motivation for starting the taco stand, Vero notes, \"Fortunately, we have a lot of work; in the mornings we serve breakfast, lunch, and the evening we serve dinner.\" The only difficulty is that this time of year is Lent, when red meat isn't eaten and sales drop.
