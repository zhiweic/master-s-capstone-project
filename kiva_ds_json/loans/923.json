But he no longer manages to satisfy his customers because his capital barely allows him to stock up sufficiently for satisfying the growing demand. \r\n\r\nTo alleviate this problem, he would like this loan to stock up on sufficient quantities of thinners, paints, sheet metal, and many other hardware items. This will enable him to meet the demand and especially to increase his sales and consequently his profits. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1165813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy thinners, paints, and sheet metal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-08-14T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-13T15:00:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Georges","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20968},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21701},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22434},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23167},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23900},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":24634},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25367},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26099},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26833},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27565},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28299},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29033}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.19,"local_amount":20968,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":21438.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308072093,"comment":null},{"amount":41.59,"local_amount":21701,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":22188.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306494,"comment":null},{"amount":43,"local_amount":22434,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":22937.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914833,"comment":null},{"amount":44.4,"local_amount":23167,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:20:57Z","rounded_local_amount":23687.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047072,"comment":null},{"amount":45.81,"local_amount":23900,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":24436.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436867,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":24634,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25187.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989285,"comment":null},{"amount":48.62,"local_amount":25367,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25936.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622899,"comment":null},{"amount":264.17,"local_amount":137829,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":140924.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437055,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T14:07:21Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T08:51:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":458231,"name":"Maria Concepcion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nMar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n de 42 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposo e hijo en su vivienda propia.

Now he has a plan to work in the mines in the rural areas. He lives with his wife and his parents in a house which is located in the ger district, Mongolian traditional nomadic yurts in the city. \r\n\r\nHis house was built in the early 1990\u2019s and there has not been any big repair or renovation since it\u2019s been built. His house has some problems such as heat loss and damage to its roof, inside walls, etc. so that he is planning to make repairs and insulate by using rock wool, cement and foam. Mr. Batzaya thinks his home will be warmer after the wall and roof insulation and a new smart furnace. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas. The loan Mr. Batzaya is taking will be used to buy some building materials for his home repair.

Nowadays, air pollution is the one of the biggest issues in Mongolian cities. This summer he started to build a small family house on his land plot behind his ger.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nRegina hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

The coffee Silvino produces is organic because he uses no chemical fertilizers during its entire production which gives it a higher market price.  Silvino delivers his entire production to the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d [coffee cooperative] to be processed and exported.  He needs a loan for his next crop because he will plant more coffee plants so that in two years his production will increase.

in a rural area located in the Sangke district where crop farming is a common way to make a living, Phally, 51, is a married mother of three children who have their own employment.

She and her husband have been in this business for several years. The main challenge for her family\u2019s business is the lack of working capital.\r\n\r\nThis is Phally's second loan with Kiva\u2019s partner VisionFund. She successfully used the first loan to relieve her family\u2019s financial burden and increase her family\u2019s income. Now she can earn about 30,000 KHR per day and can save about 15,000 KHR each day for the future. With the need to support her business, she is requesting another loan of 1,000 USD with VisionFund. She will use this loan to buy seeds for her farmland, as well as use a portion of it for land plowing. With this loan, she hopes to increase her crop yields so as to earn more income to improve her family\u2019s lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1165412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seeds for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Sangke district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-08-14T20:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-13T20:00:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phally","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":334}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":333,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":333,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118699,"comment":null},{"amount":333,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":333,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355941000,"comment":null},{"amount":334,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":334,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046428,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T08:34:09Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:48:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":459849,"name":"Petronila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petronila, age 52, sells clothes to earn a living.

Al principio comenz\u00f3 ayudando a cortar y con el tiempo fue aprendiendo m\u00e1s cosas hasta convertirse en un productor de caf\u00e9. Actualmente Lidio trabaja su parcela que aunque es peque\u00f1a le brinda un buen rendimiento pues la tiene muy bien cuidada y el mismo se encarga de realizar la mayor\u00eda de las actividades como son resembrar, abonar, control de plagas y corte. Lidio tiene 2 hijos que ya est\u00e1n casados y ellos lo ayudan en el trabajo del campo, pues prefiere contratar a sus hijos a contratar a otras personas. Durante la \u00faltima cosecha Lidio produjo un total de 3.5 toneladas de caf\u00e9 org\u00e1nico y para seguir manteniendo este nivel Lidio necesita de un cr\u00e9dito pues debe realizar labores de limpieza y abono en su finca. Para dentro de un a\u00f1o Lidio tiene planeado adquirir un peque\u00f1o terreno para sembrar m\u00e1s caf\u00e9 y as\u00ed aumentar su producci\u00f3n, la cual calcula que unos 3 a\u00f1os sea de 5 toneladas. Entre las metas personales que Lidio tiene est\u00e1 la de hacerle mejoras a su casa pues quiere brindarle a su esposa Ignacia mayores comodidades y un mejor estilo de vida.","en":"Since he was small, Lidio went to live with his grandparents who raised him and taught him how to work in the fields and everything about coffee plants. He started out by helping harvest the coffee and little by little learned more things, until he became a coffee farmer himself. Currently Lidio works his own land, that although is small produces well because it is well taken care of. He is the one who does most of the chores to take care of the coffee, like replanting, fertilizing, applying insecticide and harvesting. Lidio has two sons, both of whom are married, and they help him with the work in the fields. He prefers to have his sons work for him, than to hire other workers. During the last harvest Lidio's land produced 3.5 tons of organic coffee. In order to maintain this level of production, Lidio needs a loan to be able to clean his land and fertilize the plants. Within a year Lidio plans to rent a small plot of land to plant more coffee and in this way increase his production, he calculates that within 3 years his land will produce 5 tons. The personal goals that Lidio has include making improvements to his home, to give to his wife, Ignacia, more comforts and a better lifestyle. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1160591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers and clean his coffee fields.

Estela habita en una urbanizaci\u00f3n caracterizada por combinar perfectamente viviendas familiares, con espacios productivos formales e informales,  con el sector financiero e infraestructuras recreativas muy importantes para su comunidad,  porque son espacios    infantiles y juveniles donde concurren en su tiempo ocioso para practicar actividades l\u00fadicas y deportivas, a rededor de uno de los escenarios deportivos mas importantes del pa\u00eds como el  Estadio Metropolitano, cuna de art\u00edfices del balompi\u00e9 nacional.  Este es el ambiente en el cual Estela y su esposo sue\u00f1an con ver crecer a su hijo de 15 a\u00f1os, como un profesional exitoso y donde ella tiene un taller de confecciones  de ropa con el cual apoya el bienestar de esta familia. Estela fabrica vestidos femeninos, que vende en los almacenes que est\u00e1n ubicados a su alrededor, ropa de jeanes y tambi\u00e9n fabrica los uniformes de varias empresas; aunque la competencia en su entorno es alta, ella se sostiene con la calidad de su producto y con la capacidad de servir, que pone a disposici\u00f3n de sus clientes. Su meta es tener un mayor espacio para su taller, pero su mayor desaf\u00edo es lograr tener un capital de trabajo suficiente, para aumentar su inversi\u00f3n, incrementar su clientela y ganar cada vez m\u00e1s dinero. Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el cual comprar\u00e1  materias primas al por mayor y de contado, debido a que las ventas se incrementan en el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o y ella necesita estar preparada para hacer una buena venta basada en productos a un buen precio y con el dise\u00f1o requerido por la clientela en esta temporada del a\u00f1o.  ","en":"Estela has a lot of experience and has worked as a seamstress since 1990.  She turned that experience into a business in 2000, turning her dreams into a basis for her independence today.  Estela lives in an urban area that combines family homes and both formal and informal work spaces perfectly.  The financial sector and recreational infrastructure are both important to the community because they are spaces where children and teenagers spend their leisure time on sports and play around one of the biggest sports stadiums in the country, the Estadio Metropolitano - the national cradle of soccer.  This is the environment where Estela and her husband dream of seeing their 15-year-old son grow up to be a successful professional and where she has her sewing workshop for making the clothing which supports the family's well-being.  Estela makes dresses that she sells in the local stores, jeans, and also uniforms for various businesses.  Although the competition in her area is steep, she maintains herself with the quality of her product and with her customer service which pleases her customers.  Her goal is to have a bigger space for her workshop but her biggest challenge is to manage to have enough working capital to increase her investment, increase her clientele, and earn more money.  This is why she turned to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo foundation, which she will use to buy basic materials at wholesale and cash prices.  Due to the sales increases in the second half of the year, she needs to be prepared to make good sales based on having products at a good price and with the designs her customers want during this season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1160594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy basic

As well it has many tourist attractions, among which are the Nazca Lines, a series of ancient hieroglyphs located in the middle of an extensive arid field. According to several studies they were used as an astronomical calendar, especially to determine when the rainy season would appear. \r\n\r\nOctavio takes advantage of his spare time to read because it takes his mind off things and occasionally he also makes use of such opportunities to eat one of his favorite dishes, the delicious \u201cArroz con pollo\u201d. Due to his scarce financial resources, Octavio only studied until the third year of secondary school but he would have liked to have finished school. \r\n\r\nThrough much effort and saving, he succeeded in starting his business selling fritters and cheese empanadas, among other items.

Quinind\u00e9 is a small town located on the Ecuadorean coast. The weather in Qinind\u00e9 is tropical and rainy and there are two seasons: dry and rainy. Initially Quinind\u00e9 was only accessible through waterways and by rivers. Recently, at the end of the 1970\u2019s, a highway was built that connected Quito and Esmeraldas, which passes through Quinind\u00e9. The town of Quinind\u00e9 is sustained principally through farming and livestock raising.\r\n\r\nKleber lives in this small place.

She used this knowledge to generate her own, independent income while still being able to keep house. She has done this with her husband's support; he also knew this business from his own experiences. He decided to open the business in their home in another neighbourhood in the city. They had good results there, and gradually progressed. Later they moved to another location where things went much better for them. They were able to save up and buy their home and two lots where they built two apartments because they wanted to keep building capital in order to live a dignified old age and give their children a quality education. Elizabeth has taken out 13 loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo over 16 years. These loans have been a support to her in expanding her working capital. Her goal is to be able to build on their two lots and generate more income in order to keep strengthening their family's position.

However, Chea does not rely totally on her children, because she also farms her plot of land. \r\n\r\nChea would like to improve her farming business and ensure an abundant harvest in the coming season. That is why she is seeking a loan from HKL and Kiva to buy bean seeds and other farm supplies she needs for her crop. She is very happy about getting this loan because it will have a positive impact on her business as well as her living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1150104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy bean seeds and other farm supplies needed to produce a good harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Takeo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301422209,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308182579,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315413856,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323019163,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331155437,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339540438,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347090610,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355834897,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364543732,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-26T08:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372942411,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T04:36:47Z","paid_date":"2013-06-26T08:56:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":460734,"name":"Roufai","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Roufai a 24 ans, il est p\u00e8re d'un jeune enfant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 03ans.

","en":"Yonnis is 38 years old and owns a store located south west of the city, where he lives with his wife and their 3 children, ages 6 through 17. He has 4 years experience in running stores but it was just in 2010 that he began his own store, investing little by little and generating more income each day. Initially, he sold products brought from a neighboring country which he distributed among many businesses and families in the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nAt present, Yonnis is beginning to sell groceries daily in quantities adjusted to what his clientele can pay, creating a good commercial opportunity. He purchases groceries and meats from the storehouses of ranches, and sells them in his store. These articles are the items most in demand in his store. He sells 80 % for cash and 20 % for credit, between the hours of 6:00 am and 10:00 pm, Monday through Sunday.  His principal customers are residents of the barrio, especially women, who daily carry home the purchases of the day, obtained from Yonnis' store, to prepare meals for their families.\r\n\r\nYonnis' goal is to increase sales, but his major challenge is to obtain sufficient working capital to achieve that. That is why he is presently applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing through the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, to purchase a larger volume of groceries, soft drinks, liquors, and meals, in order to obtain discounts and diminish transportation costs. The frequency with which, until recently, he has been forced to make purchases, made his expenses higher. With this Kiva loan, he will buy in larger volume and reduce the  frequency of purchases.

She started her business idea in 2002, because she saw a business opportunity in the need that her neighbors had to respond to their communication requests. She first started with a line of cell phones for every phone operator, and gradually her business grew. She currently has 14 computers and lines of various operators, and she sells cell phone recharges and accessories. She's currently applying for her first Kiva loan, which she'll use to purchase cell phones and accessories for selling, because they're products that sell very well and change rapidly. She'll also use her Kiva loan to purchase recharges for selling. Her goal is to exand and diversify her business by adding miscellaneous merchandise until she succeeds in having her own grocery store, where her customers can find everything they need. That way they'll save themselves the transportation money and the extra effort for not finding everything within their reach. Meanwhile, she maintains a sales profit of no less than 15%, and she plans to gradually increase it by buying in bulk and selling fast-changing products, so that she earns a bit more. That is the reason why she firmly believes that with her Kiva loan she'll successfully increase her capital and buy products that are very high-selling in her business

She is married and has two children, both married. She is a hard-working woman who wants to get ahead in life. Mary Helma is really thankful to God because since joining the program of ASKI, she has been able to improve the quality of her sewn dresses which has made her business grow. Now she has a lot of customers. She had started to borrow additional capital in 2005. Her profits were used to buy a single motorcycle, which is useful in the delivery of her finished products. Mary Helma maintains her good track record to date and is asking for another loan amount of 20,000 PHP.

is 30 years old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala South region of Uganda. She is married and has 2 children with 1 of them currently in school. For the past 3 years, Nadia has been working hard to manage her salon, where she cuts and styles hair. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Nadia has requested a loan of 3000000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more cosmetics to sell, and will help Nadia to generate greater profits and pay school fees. Nadia hopes that in the future she will be able to open up another salon. \r\n\r\nNadia is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Nadia who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

is 33 years old and lives with her mother and daughter in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her family lives in a small house, in the outer ger housing districts of the city. Odgerel\u2019s mother is retired and stays at home, while Odgerel's daughter attends secondary school. \r\n\r\nOdgerel supports her family by operating a clothing retail stall at the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. In 2006, when she first began her business, she sold only leather belts and traditional Mongolian fabric belts. In the beginning stages of her business, she rented a stall at the present market from another person who had a rental contract with the market. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time. At the time her stall had 1 million MNT in working capital.

She is a married woman who is 36 years of age. She has a small family comprising four members, including one daughter and one baby son. \n\nIn December 2008, Chitra, along with three other members named Jamuna,Rukmani and Sakuntala of her village, formed a joint liability group (JLG) named Jay Maa Santoshi and took the first loan from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing business. The same group also availed the 2nd term loan from Mahashakti Foundation. During third term loan Chitra was dropped from the group due to her personal problem and a new member named Baidehi joined with other existing three members. In the present term Chitra again rejoined the group and took the leadership. This is the third loan of Chitra from Mahashakti Foundation. Initially, her husband was running a mobile garment shop at the time she took the first loan, used to attend weekly markets of nearby villages to sell clothes. Out of their small income, they are maintaining their family at a low profile. To improve her living condition and to earn some extra income, she took out a second loan and constructed a cabin in her house and started selling ready-made garments. Now she is very much confident in running her business and has developed her clothing shop significantly.\n\nThe other four members of the group are Rukmani, Jamuna and Sakuntala with 4th term loan and  Baidehi with 2nd term loan. They are also running similar types of businesses. Rukmani and Jamuna have their mobile cloth vending unit, Baidehi has a cloth weaving unit, and Sakuntala has a tailoring and dress materials cloth shop. At present, Sakuntala employs three youths to help in her business. \n\nAll members of the group are successfully running their businesses and have been able to repay their previous  loans from Mahashakti Foundation completely and in due time. Due to the successful running of their businesses, the members have been able to increase their income levels, thereby increasing the volume of their business. This enhancement in income level has also helped the group members to possess different household assets for their families. Now they are sufficient enough to educate their children in the school of their locality. \n\nAs per the  estimation and appraisal, the  loan requirement of the group is 156,000 INR."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1153243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to pay for  purchasing of  ready-made garments for sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TUKLA,KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T11:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T11:00:03Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baidehi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sakuntala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":156000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":156000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-08-17T03:41:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":458072,"name":"Jhoanna Briggith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jhoanna es una joven de 20 a\u00f1os, es soltera, vive en la ciudad de Ica, en el distrito de Pueblo con su peque\u00f1o hermano, lastimosamente perdi\u00f3 a sus padres, desde entonces ella se ha hecho cargo de su peque\u00f1o hermano y dedica todos sus esfuerzos por salir adelante junto con \u00e9l, ella es una persona muy amable, trabajadora y entusiasta; lamentablemente por la necesidad de trabajar y solventar sus gastos no podido cursar estudios superiores, pero sue\u00f1a con poder hacerlo.\nCon mucho empe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n, d\u00eda a d\u00eda Jhoanna trabaja en su peque\u00f1o negocio de venta de ropa, desde tempranas horas de la ma\u00f1ana ella asistente al mercado central de su distrito para poder realizar sus ventas, Jhoanna se siente a gusto realizando su labor y cree que le va bien por su buena atenci\u00f3n.\nJhoanna se encuentra muy agradecida con los prestatarios Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada podr\u00e1 realizar la compra de mercader\u00eda, tales como: polos, camisas, chompas, pantalones, blusas, entre otras prendas; de esta manera Jhoanna tendr\u00e1 su negocio mejor abastecido, as\u00ed espera poder aumentar sus ventas e incrementar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos, los cuales desea utilizar para poder asegurar la educaci\u00f3n y bienestar de su peque\u00f1o hermano. \n","en":"Jhoanna is a young woman of 20 years of age.

Since then she has been working hard to support her children. She started the business of selling fresh fish and dry fish.

Dried fish is used in different delicacies as fresh fish is and is very popular in the region. \n\nShe buys fish directly from the local fishermen and sells some of them fresh and dries some of them to sell as dried fish.

There is a huge demand for dried fish during the monsoon season as not much stock is available in the market. So, she can get a better price as well. This loan will help her increase the working capital to run her business, increasing her revenues by almost 50% giving 5000 to 6000 INR per month. \n\nShe wants to save enough to give her three children a good quality of life and send them to school.

That is why Zelsa started to work 15 years ago.  She looked for a stand at the market in the area, and she started to sell chicken.\r\n\r\nLittle by little she was getting customers until she managed to have customers that go to her stand almost every day to buy chicken.  She strives to give them good service and to sell them fresh products.

The lady standing at the extreme left raising her hand in the photo is Gouri.\r\nShe is 28 years old, living with her husband, her son aged 8, and her daughter aged 6. She belongs to a Below Poverty Line family (BPL), a segment living on less than a dollar a day. Her husband does multiple jobs--from being a tractor driver to a daily wage labor in the paddy fields. His was the only source of income for their family until Gouri decided to step up and share the burden with her husband. \r\n\r\nGouri started her leaf plate business in 2004 on a small scale under these compelling circumstances and has been working hard to grow her business. She makes plates woven out of dry leaves at her house and local traders in the village come and collect them every week. She makes 1000-1500 plates each week. These plates are biodegradable, disposable, hygienic, and an inexpensive alternative to modern paper or plastic utensils. These are widely used by local food stalls and hotels to serve food.\r\n\r\nShe gets her supply of leaves and bamboo twigs used for stitching from local sellers in the market and sun-dries them for two days to make them ready to be stitched. Presently, the stock she buys from the local sellers is enough for her to make plates for one day and sell the next day. She wants to have enough stock to support her business during the monsoon as well when she cannot get dry leaves.

Also, she wants it to be in a location close to her house and accessible to her customers, enabling her to divide her time conveniently between household work and running the shop. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Sabita, Gouri, and Janaki and are  running a food stall, a betel nut shop, etc. Since the inception of Sri Jagannath group, Ranjita has been heading the group with dedication and sincerity.
