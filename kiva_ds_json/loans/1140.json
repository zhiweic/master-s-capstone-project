age 50, deals in the business of hand-embroidery. She has expertise in this area and has been using her skills to provide for her family for over 8 years now.  She makes beautiful patterns for the people of her community. Her designs are much in demand and she has managed to consolidate a clientele that allows her to contribute to the expenses of her home.

She works six days a week from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and enjoys her business because she likes having contact with her customers. She started this business with money given to her by mother. She is requesting a loan to buy more rice, oil and vita to sell to her customers. Her goal for the future is to build a house for her children.

St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia, which is known for fresh fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Freeport.

She has three children between the ages of 14 and 9. Her three children are in school, and they all live at home.\r\n \r\nLoretta owns her own sales table, and she has sold cooking ingredients, like pepper, oil, and okra, for the past four years.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase similar goods.  On average, she works 10 hours per day at her business.  She started her business with money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by taxi.  She cites rainy seasons as her biggest business challenge.  Her favorite part of her business is the profit.

Her children live at home and go to school. Her spouse works as driver.\r\n \r\nJulia has a sales table, where she sells bread, sugar, oil, rice and other foods.

Kumba was unable to attend school, and today works in St. Paul, which is the oldest market in Liberia and known for fish because of its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb just outside Monrovia. It is one of the poorer areas of the country and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. Kumba works at a table where she has sold charcoal for the last 15 years. Her greatest challenge in life is the small income she earns. She is applying for this loan to buy more charcoal to sell to her customers. Her goal is to one day own a house.

is 39 years old and lives in the Liberian town of St. Paul, a suburb located outside of Monrovia.  It has one of the oldest markets in the country and is known for fresh fish because it is located by the ocean.  However, it is also one of the poorer areas of the country, and housing quality is often very low. Finda is married and the mother of four children who range in age from 23 to 15 years old. Her spouse works as teacher. Two of her children live at home and still attend school. Finda works at a table in the local market where she sells bread and soft drinks.  She has been in business for five years and works 12 hours a day. She is requesting this loan to buy more items to sell to her customers. One of the greatest challenges she faces in life is her low income. She transports her goods to market by taxi and started her business with money from her mother.  She is proud of her work because it allows her to earn an income. Her goal is to someday build a house. She would like to extend her thanks to Kiva lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Freeport.  It is one of the poorer areas, and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing.\r\n\r\nChristina has a sales table, and she has been selling charcoal there, for the past three years.  She works ten hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is low income. She intends to use the loan to buy charcoal to resell at her table. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business, because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.

is a 44-year-old business woman from Liberia.  She is married and has three children, between 28 and 16 years old. Two of her children are currently attending school and live at home. She has completed grade 12 before starting her business.  She describes herself as working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in St. Paul.  St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past Freeport.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing.\r\n \r\nLouise has had a shop business, which sells lappa (Traditional cloths), for the past 13 years.  She works ten hours at her business a day.  Her greatest challenge in business is the small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

lives and works in St. Paul. St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past Freeport. It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nMusu is 50 years old, married with four children. Only the 17-year-old child is in school and lives at home. For the past four years she has been operating a small shop where she sells soap, tissue, oil, etc. She says sometimes the buying is slow. Musu says she started this business by selling around in the communities with the little goods she could afford.  She learned this way of selling from her friends. She is requesting a loan to purchase more goods for her business. Her plan is to expand her business even

lives and works in St. Paul. St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past Freeport. It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nYatta is 28 years old, married with four children between 10 to 3 years old.  They are in school and live at home. For the past six years she has been operating a small shop where she sells rice, pepper, oil, etc. The rainy season is the problem that she faces. Yatta says she started this business by selling for her mother and learned this way of selling from her friends. She is requesting a loan to purchase more goods for her business. Her plan is to expand her business even

is single with five children between the ages of 2 and 19 years old. They live in Nimba County in Liberia. Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore. The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea. As a result, many people on business pass through the area, bringing lots of trade. It is also the second most populous area in Liberia.\r\n\r\nAnnie has had a business for the past three years selling palm oil, starting this business with funds from her mother. She works at her business daily for around eight hours. She transports the goods to her business by pickup. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is a shortage of goods in her shop.\r\n\r\nAnnie has requested a loan to purchase more palm oil for her business. She describes herself as a hardworking woman. In the future, she hopes to own a house. She is proud of her business because she earns money every day to cover her expenses.\r\n\r\nAnnie wants to thank all of the lenders who support BRAC

He is originally from Le\u00f3n, a place in the west of the country. He can be characterized as responsible, hardworking, and wanting to overcome problems. In his spare time, he enjoys himself playing games like baseball with his kids. Unfortunately, because he didn't have the economic resources, he was not able to study for a degree and he had to work from a very early age.\r\nThanks to his spirit of excellence and his desire to succeed, he has a business selling merchandise such as men's and women's clothes: trousers, blouses, t-shirts, skirts, shorts, dresses, underwear, towels, nightwear. He works about 9 hours a day and he sells door to door, carrying a 30kg package of clothes. The goal of this loan is to supply his business by buying merchandise so that, in the not too distant future, he can get a better income. Miguel Ger\u00f3nimo is grateful for the help that the Kiva lenders offer to people who have scare resources and to poor countries such as Nicaragua so they can have dignified work. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":191.45,"image":{"id":885197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to have business capital to buy and sell merchandise such as men's and women's clothes: trousers, blouses, t-shirts, skirts, shorts, dresses, underwear, towels, nightwear.

meet Dorothy from Liberia.

Her husband is a security guard. She has two children between the ages of 20 and 10, one of whom is in school. They all live at home.\r\n\r\nOn average, she works 10 hours a day at her business. She started her business with money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by bus. She cites high price of gasoline as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is that she makes more profits. In the future, she would like to own a house.\r\n\r\nDorothy has owned her shop selling cold water and soft drinks for the past 20 years.

is Ernesa. Her previous loan was a big help in her business. She was able to buy more products and ingredients for her food stall. The loan also helped in the education of her children. She has been in her business for seven years already. She and her husband are continuously working to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nErnesa would like to apply for a 16,000 Philippine peso loan to purchase raw ingredients and supplies needed in her business. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to meet her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nErnesa dreams of expanding her business and hopes to have a good life for her family.

in Kampong Cham province, Mom is married and blessed with four children.  Nowadays, three of her kids are still under her dependency. She manages two hectares of rice growing as the main source of income while her husband works for others for a fee. The 20 years involvement in the current business, she is able to earn around 22,000 KHR per day. This is the third time that Mom has been with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). Her past loan, which she has repaid with success, has supported her business on time and has returned her a decent profit to sustain her living as well as to keep her kids in school.

is Susan, 47, a resident of Cabrera, Pasay, Philippines. She has three children and they help one another in managing their household while operating the business. At this time, Susan is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nSusan operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during the evening when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Susan also has a direct selling business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, as well as frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSusan hopes to expand her business and dreams of giving her children a good life and a good education.

Her mother has retired from work and gets a state pension. The apartment they live in has been deteriorating over the years and it needs some serious repair including installing vacuum insulated windows and hardwood floors, and insulating walls with fiberglass and foam.

It has also had a bad effect on the immediate environment due to soil deterioration from gray water and chemicals. <p>\r\n\r\nKhishigsuren is therefore requesting a loan of 3000000 MNT to cover the cost of connecting her second bakery shop to the main sewerage line. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":930.2,"image":{"id":1367296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to cover the cost of connecting her bakery shop to the main sewerage system","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2013-06-09T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-09T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":54.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khishigsuren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":216800},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":225224.69},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":229058.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":241466.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":243917.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250470.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":258580.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":261833.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":273970.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":279926.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":286512.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":232238.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":151.76,"local_amount":216800,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":216939.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390553425,"comment":null},{"amount":145.66,"local_amount":225224.69,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":225369.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12,"payment_id":399802432,"comment":null},{"amount":152.38,"local_amount":229058.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":229206.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.96,"payment_id":410078461,"comment":null},{"amount":154.76,"local_amount":241466.57,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":241621.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.27,"payment_id":419844899,"comment":null},{"amount":160.77,"local_amount":243917.18,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":244074.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.97,"payment_id":429493811,"comment":null},{"amount":164.87,"local_amount":250470.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":250631.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.46,"payment_id":439717946,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-10T14:45:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":569565,"name":"Musarat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Musarat, 38, is a hardworking, diligent woman.

The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her children\u2019s education and cover their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRosario hopes to have her own store and dreams that her children will finish their studies.  She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

 is 48 years old. She is a mother of five children. Gulebeste is an IDP (internally displaced person) who lives with her husband and children in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. She is a Jabrayili refugee. She is a farmer.\r\n\r\nGulebeste has been doing this work for ten years, and she has been doing it by herself since she started. She really enjoys her work because she feels free and independent. At the same time, it\u2019s going very well for her, and this helps her to feel calmer. \r\n\r\nHer plans are to expand her cropland, care for it, and integrate more technology so she can obtain an excellent harvest.

is a 39-year-old housewife. She lives with her husband and four children in Punjab, Pakistan. Since 2000, her husband has been running a general store, which is the only source of income for the family. Yasmeen also helps her husband in his business; he needs additional capital for the growth of his business. For that she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. With the loan money, her husband can buy a variety of products, like flour, sugar, eggs, and rice for his general store. This will help him to satisfy his clients more professionally, as well as increase his savings for the better future of his children. With the profits expected from this loan, Yasmeen intends to expand her husband's business so that she can purchase a sewing machine for her personal use. Yasmeen and her husband are very hopeful that the loan will be a lucky and productive one for their

She lives together with her husband Miguel and their two children in the home of her in-laws.  At this time she is facing an economic crisis.  She rented some land where she planted alfalfa, but the owners of the land sold it while the crop was still green.  This caused her to lose her entire investment, but she is not defeated.  She learned from this experience and now she is a little more careful, thus she will plant alfalfa on her own agricultural land, which is small, and she also plans to buy grown alfalfa from third parties.  Her main source of income focuses on selling bundles of alfalfa, which she sends daily to another city.  This is her third credit with Kiva and she feels happy for the financial support that she receives in order to continue her business.

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTeodora operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them individually. She also sells fish. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 17,000 PHP loan to help her to continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nTeodora hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams of having a better life. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and it is there where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

He lives in the city of Ica, in the district of Parcona with his young daughter. He loves her and she is main priority in life. She is very friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic. He puts all his efforts towards bringing up his child, as Fidel has always been father and mother to her. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to lack of financial resources and the need to work from a very young age to help his parents, Fidel could not study for a professional career in Civil Engineering, but he wanted to. In his free time he likes to play soccer with his friends and sometimes cook the delicious Chicharrones de Cerdo (pork cracklings) to share with his family.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, with a lot of effort and dedication, Fidel works in his small grocery and stationery store.

is a 42-year-old housewife. She lives with her husband and five children in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Since 2010, her husband has been running a general store, and he works very hard to meet his family\u2019s needs. Due to the large family size and their low monthly income, they are facing many problems. Her husband needs additional capital for the growth of his business. She has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can invest in her husband\u2019s shop. With the loan, her husband would expand the general store. He would add some more space to it by building one more room. He would also buy a variety of goods, such as rice, sugar, soap, cereals, milk and utility items, for his store, to satisfy his clients more professionally and to increase his savings to better the future of his children. The profits would be used to expand the business and pay household expenses. Azra and her husband are very hopeful that the loan will be a lucky and productive one for their family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":213.48,"image":{"id":1367325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is Crisales, aged 32, who lives in Silang, Cavite in the Philippines. She is married to Sonny, who is a driver, and they have children together. By the grace of God, she has managed to support their children's schooling. At the moment, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCrisales oversees the operations of their jeepney business (small bus - see footnote). She has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which earns  boundary (rent) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippines Pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy spare parts, and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She is planning to expand her business and therefore expects an increase in her business income.  \r\n\r\nCrisales dreams of having a better life. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work. At the meetings, she can also draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\nFootnote: Interestingly, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

She says that she began working a short time ago as a health promoter for the state, looking for malnourished children in her area.  She earns extra money.\r\n\r\nShe also raises livestock such as pigs, donkeys, and rams, which she later sells in the central market in town.  Betty would like to plant in greater quantity in the future so she can become independent.  She also plans to open a grocery store to help generate more financial resources.  She is a member of the \u201cSanta Cruz de Tapo\u201d communal bank and this will be her fourth Kiva loan, where she has shown to be responsible and pays on time.  Betty will use the money to buy compost to feed her crops.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375.53,"image":{"id":1366273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-09T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-09T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":122.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":126.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":134.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":138.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":146.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":151.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":159.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":166.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":173.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":180.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.11,"local_amount":122.9,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":128.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975820,"comment":null},{"amount":48.43,"local_amount":126.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":132.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997088,"comment":null},{"amount":51.41,"local_amount":134.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":140.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864558,"comment":null},{"amount":53.07,"local_amount":138.44,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":144.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352926,"comment":null},{"amount":56.1,"local_amount":146.37,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":152.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904693,"comment":null},{"amount":58.16,"local_amount":151.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":158.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090701,"comment":null},{"amount":61.25,"local_amount":159.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":166.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777367,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-10T01:21:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568983,"name":"Zenon","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Zen\u00f3n  tiene 51 a\u00f1os,  tiene tres  hijos, el se dedica a la construcci\u00f3n de muebles,  tiene su carpinter\u00eda que se encuentra ubicado en la zona de Tembladerani de la ciudad de la Paz  se dedica a esta actividad desde hace ya 20 a\u00f1os,  esta actividad lo aprendi\u00f3 de su padre quien tambi\u00e9n era carpintero,  este pr\u00e9stamo es su primera secuencia dentro de la instituci\u00f3n, el Sr. Zen\u00f3n  utilizara  este pr\u00e9stamo  para  la compra de madera para la construcci\u00f3n de muebles , su raz\u00f3n para solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo es la falta de capital para la compra de este material de trabajo, ya que sin esto no podr\u00eda realizar sus muebles,  el Sr. Sr. Zen\u00f3n  enfrenta retos en su negocio que son salir de la pobreza  va a utilizar los beneficios para mejorar su calidad de vida, ya que esta es su \u00fanica actividad que le permite mantenerse y mantener a su familia, por este motivo se siente feliz ya agradecido a la instituci\u00f3n por el apoyo brindado.","en":"Zen\u00f3n is 51 years old.

For the past two years, Mary has been working hard to manage her salon, where she does hair dressing. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mary has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more hair care products for the salon, and will help Mary to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young sister. Mary hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand the salon into a unisex salon. \r\n\r\nMary is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She has worked hard to gain popularity and recognition within her town. With the increase in the price of vegetables and lentils, she was barely able to produce enough to make a good sale. Two years ago, Kousar borrowed funds for her business from Kashf Foundation, hoping to revive it. Today, she has been successful in consistently making sales and earning a healthy revenue from the business. In order to increase her sales, she needs to purchase packs of flour, oil, salt and spices. For this reason, she applied for a loan of Rs 40,000 from Kashf Foundation. She is in her third loan cycle with a good repayment history. She wishes to spend part of her revenue on expansion of her business.

Lom Group\u201d.  She is the featured borrower. She is on the extreme left with her hand raised in the picture. \n\nThe group members reside in a village which is about 40 kms away from the capital city of Manipur, in the northeastern side of India. With younger siblings to take care of and a weary mother, life was not easy for Martha. Her friends motivated her to join the group, and she availed the loan and started her own retail shop.\n\nShe runs a variety shop at the local market, which is about a three-minute walk from home. She started her business by selling mobile recharge vouchers and gradually refilled her recharge voucher shop with daily essential items like detergent soap, detergent powder, shampoo sachets, etc. for sale.  The shop is also refilled with candies, chocolates, sweets and other cosmetic items. \n\nShe is making a fine profit and also started saving. She gets the stock from the main city market and also from people who trade items through the Army Canteen. She says it is profitable to purchase stock from the Army Canteen. The profit is high because the goods are purchased at a low cost price and can be sold at a market price. \n\nShe wanted to use the savings that she manages for refilling her shop with different items. She says the amount is small; therefore she was still waiting for another few months. God still favors her because when she was really in need for a capital amount, Kiva came into the limelight.\n\nWith the assistance of a Kiva loan, and together with her small savings, she is planning to purchase women\u2019s wraparound skirts exported from the neighbouring states like Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya. She says the main costume for women in the state is wraparound skirts, which she believes is a good trade for earning. It will not be a difficult business because the market is large in respect to women\u2019s wraparound skirts. \n\nMartha says, \u201cIt is a wonderful experience for me that people from far-flung countries help us in our needs. Thanks to Kiva and may God bless.\u201d\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1367302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase exported women's wraparound skirts from the neighbouring states, sell them, and make more savings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-06-10T07:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-10T07:30:17Z","loan_amount":4225,"lender_count":129,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaiting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengpichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahneichin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneivah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengvei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhinghoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinkhoneng ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veineichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":240000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":240000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T13:38:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":569099,"name":"Jomar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jomar peacefully lives with his wife and two children in Sto.

The couple have two children who they care for in their own home which they bought 28 years ago.  Every day, Rosa walks long stretches to arrive at her farmland where she sows alfalfa, beans, corn, carrots and potatoes.  She has 18 years experience in this line of work and, every harvest time, she sells her crops in a nearby city where wholesale buyers from a well-known market come and buy the food produced on the land that Rosa cares for.

She does this in her free time as it allows her to keep an eye on her crops too and not neglect them. She also raises animals such as guinea pigs and donkeys.
