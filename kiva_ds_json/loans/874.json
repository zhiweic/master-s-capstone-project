ingresos adicionales con los que usualmente cuenta.  Para el desempe\u00f1o en su negocio tiene una m\u00e1quina de dos latas para trillar ma\u00edz y una experiencia familiar que inici\u00f3 desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, con muy poco capital, pero con la ayuda de Dios y esfuerzos conjuntos de su familia, han logrado s\u00e1calo adelante y ser cada d\u00eda mas competitivos. Su meta principal es impulsar el crecimiento de su negocio, porque su clientela se incrementa, pero su capital de trabajo resulta insuficiente, para responderle, convirti\u00e9ndose esta situaci\u00f3n en su principal desaf\u00edo. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante la cual comprar\u00e1 materias primas (ma\u00edz), en mayor volumen, inversi\u00f3n que Yoanna considera ser\u00e1 exitosa, porque siempre tendr\u00e1 productos que ofrecer a su creciente clientela; en un futuro planea comprar una m\u00e1quina para obtener el cuchuco (un alimento que consiste en el ma\u00edz, la cebada o trigo en grano pelado y trozado o semimolido, que se usa para hacer sopas en Colombia) y por eso poco a poco se concentrar\u00e1 en fortalecer su producci\u00f3n y con ello su clientela, para finalmente lograr un sue\u00f1o compartido con su esposo, que no es otro que ver crecer a sus dos hijos, hoy  en las edades de 4 y 9 a\u00f1os, en condiciones que potencialicen su \u00e9xito profesional. ","en":"Yoanna has a business where she sells purina animal feed and grower, as well as heads of corn, threshing bran, hulled corn, cuchuco and cabecita, which are different characteristics of corn and have different uses in Colombian nutrition. Yoanna also sells sacks which give her an extra income which she counts on. In order to run her business she has a machine with two tins for threshing corn as well as family experience. She started four years ago with very little capital but with God's help and her joint family efforts they have managed to get their family ahead and become more competitive every day.\r\n\r\nHer main goal in is continue extending her business, because her client base is increasing but she does not have enough capital to respond to the demand, so this situation has become her main challenge. This is the reason why she has come to Cridkiva for her first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use this loan to buy supplies (corn) in large quantities.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJoane maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She also sells snacks for additional income. She earns a minimum of 3,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nJoane dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1111602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for merchandise and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T14:01:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T14:01:09Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":12499.98,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":12731.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359430,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":8333.02,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8487.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303245,"comment":null},{"amount":685.42,"local_amount":29167,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":29707.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484752,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T09:26:46Z","paid_date":"2013-02-16T11:33:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":434487,"name":"Ricardo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ricardo is from San Jose, Aurora, Zamboanga Del Sur.

Many years ago due to various unfortunate circumstances, Victor and his wife divorced, thereby leaving him to be both father and mother to his son.  For this reason, he continues to persevere and press forward in life.  Victor has always been a very enthusiastic and hardworking man.  He has held various jobs, one of them working as a miner in the city, which unfortunately led to him losing his vision in his left eye.  Four years ago, with the help of his family, Victor was able to proceed with establishing a small business selling food.  He has good clients who enjoy his delicious food, his charisma, and his friendly service.  \r\n<p>\r\nVictor is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the assistance they have provided, he will be able to buy a freezer that he needs for preserving perishable supplies, such as meat and vegetables that he uses in cooking.

is a 26-year-old single man.\r\n\r\nHe is employed, but the salary he gets isn't enough to cover his needs. For the past four years, Medhat has also been purchasing and selling used spare parts such as generators, blacksmith tools and compressors. This has been a profitable project, but he needs more support to cover the costs and purchases.\r\n\r\nMedhat is requesting a youth loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing more used spare parts to resell. This will increase sales and improve Medhat's income.\r\n\r\nMedhat is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is both family tradition and a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered wasteful to spend money on cooking gas and food for one to two persons when cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food.  Lilibeth earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales everyday.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a Php 14,000 loan to buy more quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLilibeth dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Angel has a small motorcycle and bicycle repair shop, and he tells us that he has many clients because there are very few people who currently do this kind of work. He has learned how to be a mechanic from a young age by helping his father, who taught him not only how to repair but also about the kind of treatment that he should give to his clients. A little while ago he decided to find his own path as he was starting a family and he needed to improve his income. He tells us that now he works from Monday through Sunday, from 8 in the morning until 7 at night, and he is able to work these hours because the shop is located next to his home. Angel tells us that he hopes to not face any further competition in this sector because things are going well and he is generating enough income for his family.

Most of the people here cultivate corn. They chose their group name because where they meet there are a lot of capulines [a type of cherry]. They are a small group, but they take advantage of the opportunity to do big things like making cherry atole [a corn-based drink], cherry tamales, etc. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are all very busy women with a lot of commitments - the day we visited them they had a lot on their agenda including tending to their businesses, school meetings, etc.\r\n\r\nWe interviewed the friendly Maria de los Remedios, 51, who has been married to Alfredo for 34 years. Together they have 4 children who are already grown. They still support their daughter who is a single mother - Remedios takes care of their grandchild while her daughter works in Mexico City.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she makes aprons that are typical of the region, in traditional colors like pink, green, neon yellow, red, blue, etc. She says \"I learned from very young to make Nahua skirts that are typical of the region, as shown in the picture they are very full skirts and are therefore referred to as aprons. They are put on top of the skirts.\" she has been making the aprons for 25 years, starting when her husband bought her a sewing machine. She said that before, she didn't know how to make them but her mother-in-law did and didn't want to teach her. Remedios tried to make them herself, and with practice they started to turn out well and she has no trouble selling them because customers come on their own to her house to buy them.\r\n\r\nHer difficulty is that her sewing machine is broken, but if she has leftover money from the loan she will fix it. Even though she doesn't have a sewing machine right now, in the future she wants to fix up the room where she sews and make it into a seamstress workshop.

Twelve years ago, he decided to put his knowledge to work by opening up his own shop where he could work independently.  Carpentry is a family business, because his father was the one who taught him to work with wood and make final products such as beds, dressers, living room sets, and other items.  Now it's his turn, and he is working in his shop with his children.  His wife Flor has a business selling clothing.  Jose tells us that he enjoys the work that he does and he is well known for it.  He says that he is currently having some problems with his vision, and one of the main reasons is the lint that comes out when he is brushing the wood, because he doesn't have the tools he needs for this process.  But he continues ahead in the same way, and he will use this loan to buy wood to process.  His dream is to have a bigger shop with all of the tools that he needs to make his work

He lives with his wife and son in one of the settlements that make up the rural district of M\u00f3rrope.  This zone is considered to be one of the poorest in the Lambayeque region, but at the same time is one of the most traditional.  Its people are very humble and hardworking.\r\n\r\nHe raises and sells livestock and has some pens set up behind his house where he raises small animals, like turkeys, ducks, chickens, etc.  He also raises livestock like goats and pigs.  When they have developed correctly, he offers them for sale to buyers in the zone.  He also works as a field hand, for which he receives a weekly salary.  Thanks to these activities, he is able to support the family\u2019s precarious finances.\r\n\r\nTom\u00e1s would like to acquire more animals and balanced feed to expand his livestock business so that he can increase his income and improve his quality of life.  In order to reach his objective he has found it in his interest to request a loan of 1,500 PEN through Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nHe has had a previous loan from Kiva and he is very grateful to those who supported him.

48, is a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. He is married to Agripina, a housewife, and father to his children, who are all employed. With his wife and children, he manages their household while operating a processed meat business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nThe processed meat store is where one can buy processed and frozen meat like hot dogs, ham, and the like. Felix buys processed meat at wholesale prices and sells retail by the kilo. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, he is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. He will use the loan to buy additional processed and frozen meat products to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nFelix hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he hopes to support his children's schooling up to college level.

They live in a house that she inherited from her parents.  \r\n<p>\r\nElva sells hardware goods from a store that is set up in her home, which prevents her from paying rent on a shop.  Her business is busy with activity and is stocked with various products.  She has been in this business for 10 years and her son helps with attending to the customers.  Elva enjoys her work because it generates an income that helps her partner with the household expenses and it also provides a distraction for her.  She enjoys having her own capital because it makes her feel independent.  What she dislikes is the fact that her business is located along a road that is not paved.  Therefore, the vehicles that drive by stir up dust that accumulates on her shelves, so she is left having to clean every day.  Elva is not discouraged and wants to continue and expand her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with the MFP organization.  She is pleased to have financial support for advancing her business.  For this reason, she promises to be punctual with her payments, just as she was with her previous loans.  Elva feels comfortable with her group because she considers them to be responsible and supportive people.  The loan amount of 2,500 PEN that she requested will be used to buy hardware goods in bulk.  She will also buy motorcycle parts.  Elva looks for the most affordable price, so she buys in volume in order to generate more profit.

He hopes these improvements will give his family a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1111001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"to complete improvements and repairs to his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.79},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.1},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.27},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.31},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.42},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":434562,"name":"Tawah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tawah is 42 years old and lives in compound #3.

Her children are the motivation to work persistently every day to create conditions that will lead to a better well-being.\r\n\r\nAnne works at two activities. On the one hand she offers beauty services and on the other she makes fruit juices for sale. She learned both activities three years ago and it was in 2010 that she started to use them to earn income.\r\n\r\nHer clientele are neighbors, friends, family members and people referred by current customers. The sale of natural juice takes place nearby her place of operation and she is able to monitor both businesses. She works as a stylist whenever her clientele requires it.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to become a professional stylist and to expand her profit margin investing to attract more customers but her working capital is her greatest challenge to reach this dream. This is the reason why she\u2019s requesting her Kiva loan, her first financing from Yehu Microfinance Trust, that she\u2019ll use to buy beauty supplies and modern equipment like a hair straightening iron and a hair dryer. She will also buy fruit to continue strengthening her two income-producing businesses she plans to use to improve her family\u2019s future.

She lives near the outskirts of Cumbe Parish in Cuenca, a place that has a cold climate.  Its geographic location is very rugged and offers beautiful landscapes to enjoy nature.  The residents raise animals and farm, and still preserve the culture and traditions of their communities.\r\n\r\nRosa, 49, is married and has six children from this relationship, all adults.  Three of them are married and live on their own.  Two of her children are studying in the university in the city and one daughter stays at home helping her with the housework.  Her husband is a cabinetmaker by trade and works in his own shop.  They live in their own house.\r\n \r\nRosa spends the majority of her time at home.

We admit that Manale is a brave young woman, although her husband's support is the reason she has attained with her children what they have right now. He's an employee at the CFC, a resident company located on the other side of their town. \r\n\r\nAs Manale wants to better develop her business and improve her work as well, she decided to take a loan from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase a modern tailoring machine which can speed up her work and make it much easier. This Kiva loan will also allow her to offer a greater quality of products and thus improve her income by at least 20%. This is how she works every day to make her greatest dream a reality and have a bigger business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1111755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a modern tailoring machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":115,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T16:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T16:30:08Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manale","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T07:51:36Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287368082,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-29T08:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294519770,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-03T08:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301328541,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-24T08:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308085623,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-16T09:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322928515,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331061292,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199882,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663963,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373049320,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T02:53:20Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:57:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":434595,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael is thirty-four years old, single, and runs a second-hand clothing business.

La actividad m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es la preparaci\u00f3n de la \"espumilla\", un dulce t\u00edpico producto de batir huevos durante aproximadamente una hora y media hasta obtener una crema fina y luego mezclarla con pulpa de alguna fruta y az\u00facar, ya que tiene que prepararla a las 4 a.m. para de esta manera venderla en la puerta de ingreso de una escuelita. Trabaja un promedio de 10 horas al d\u00eda y sus hijas le ayudan en su labor. Pagar el arriendo de su local es un costo que para ella es alto, sin embargo ha sabido ser una persona cumplida y responsable. Ver\u00f3nica desea invertir en dulces para su tienda y en insumos para la elaboraci\u00f3n de comida r\u00e1pida; para ello necesita un cr\u00e9dito con el cual pueda crecer y sobre todo dar a sus hijos y esposo la posibilidad de tener una mejor calidad de vida.\n\nPara Ver\u00f3nica la familia es sumamente importante y durante su tiempo libre le gusta pasear con ellos en parques y centros comerciales. Su sue\u00f1o es crecer econ\u00f3micamente y dar a su familia todo lo necesario para llevar una vida libre de carencias.\n\n","en":"Ver\u00f3nica is a 30 year old woman, married to Pablo 33 and they have two children.  \r\n\r\nThey live in \"Chillogallo\" a parish in the city of Quito, the capital of Ecuador; It's very quaint and it's known for its commercial activities.

She lives in the city of Manta where she has her cement house with basic services. She is separated but is in charge of her two children who study in public school. Amparo tells us that the business was started by her parents, who taught her how to collect and treat her product. She explains to us that the hard and white seed, almost like ivory, is obtained from the seeds of the Phytelephas palm. The polished endosperm of the seed looks much like ivory, despite having completely distinct properties. In Ecuador, the species used for obtaining the tagua seed is phitelephas aequatorialis, which exists in the subtropical region between the Andes and the coast especially in the province of Manabi. Additionally, the tagua seeds can be processed like flour which can then be used to feed animals like cows, pigs and birds. It is estimated that in 1920, some 20% of buttons produced in the United States were made of tagua, principally from Ecuador, Colombia and Panama. Currently, it is mostly used to make buttons and decorative animal figures which are highly sought after by tourists. Her children help her to collect and sell in their spare time, and she is very grateful for their help as it can become quite heavy to transport these products. She will invest this loan in the purchase of utensils which can be used during the polishing process. In the coming years she would like to buy a vehicle to improve transportation for her

Her husband Jose is an independent fisherman. They have 2 children, one who is 9 months and one who is 9 years old and attends public school. 4 years ago Yoly started selling beauty products by catalog. She began to sell this way because her husband was not earning much money fishing and she needed to cover her family's expenses, especially those of her children. Yoly works alone, going door-to-door in the area where she lives visiting potential clients. She brings with her a suitcase full of her products with the price marked on each one. For example: perfumes for $17.95, deoderants for %7.61, creams for $22.22 and similarly for other products. The products from the catalogs already have the price printed.

Mari says that one of the most unpleasant situations she has faced in her personal life is the illness suffered by her daughter, which involves psychomotor impairment.

He is a very hardworking and enthusiastic man who wants to continue to exert himself in order to get ahead with his family.  Ever since he was very young, he needed to work to pay for his expenses.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, he was not able to enroll in a university, but he would have liked to have been able to study accounting.  In his spare time, Arturo likes to take a walk through the hot streets of the city with his family, and at times after his walk he enjoys eating the dish of \"arroz con pato\" (duck with rice). \r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, and thanks to the support of his wife, Arturo works as a driver with his own mototaxi.  He works about 10 hours a day, during which time he can serve about 45 customers.  He believes that his business is going well because of the friendly and respectful service he provides to his customers.\r\n\r\nArturo is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help they are providing he will be able to make some repairs and improvements that his mototaxi needs.  These are: replacing the canopy, steering wheel, and sprocket wheel, overhauling the engine and painting the vehicle.  In this way, Arturo will be able to rely on a mototaxi that is in good condition, and he can increase his customer base and his income.  With this income, he wants to be able to do some finishing work on his house, and in the not too far future he hopes to be able to acquire an automobile so that he can continue to work and provide a better quality of life for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1111277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"to repair and renovate his mototaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T23:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T23:50:13Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arturo Martin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":94.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":97.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":106.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":110.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.71,"local_amount":89.89,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":91.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222541,"comment":null},{"amount":35.38,"local_amount":94.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":95.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298626,"comment":null},{"amount":36.59,"local_amount":97.58,"processed_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":99.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351357,"comment":null},{"amount":38.13,"local_amount":101.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":103.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108995,"comment":null},{"amount":39.82,"local_amount":106.21,"processed_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":107.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345178,"comment":null},{"amount":41.37,"local_amount":110.31,"processed_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954391,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-08T02:09:57Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:40:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":434849,"name":"Consolacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For more than 14 years in Migpange, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental, Consolacion, a 49-year-old married mother of three children, has made a living through the operation of a general store.

Her husband works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nOur friend is getting the loan to help her husband in his job.  He works in agriculture and has rice crops.  She tells us that his production is very good and that currently they are already gathering the harvest.  This is exactly why they need the loan, to pay for labor, because if they sold the crop right now they would have to sell it very cheap, and the wholesale merchants would be the ones to get the profits.  This is why, upon getting the loan, they can wait a little and get better profits from the hard field work.  They plant every season of the year because they have water-pumping equipment.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to pay for labor.  She has been in the communal bank since the beginning and she is on the bank board.

He helped all his siblings to study through sixth grade and this is how Don Hector has acquired extensive experience in his work. To buy all agricultural materials, Hector runs half an hour's walk to the main diversion to await the bus that takes him to the city, about forty-five minutes away. Then he is back on the bus with the materials and then he pays a vehicle to take him home because the bus does not come to his house.

herself, as well as five foster children, which she took in after her sister died. As a main source of income for her family, Burulush has worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 1998. After having started this business with the purchase of two cows, Burulush, due to her hard work, currently has five cows, ten sheep and one horse at her farm. Further, Burulush cultivates 1.0 hectares of land, where she grows clover (for fodder). The monthly income from the farm is in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Burulush turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 45,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep with the goal to fatten and resell them. Burulush plans to invest the income from the loan in further growing her business through a grocery store, in order to have the possibility to give the children a good education in the
