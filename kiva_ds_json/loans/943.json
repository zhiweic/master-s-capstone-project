He learned everything from his father who also worked in the same activity.  He told us that when he was young he used to go to the ranch during harvest season to help his family harvest after school.  When Anselmo married Catalina he became financially independent because his dad gave him a piece of land to start off on his own.  They have a 20-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son.  When it's harvest season his son helps because he wants to teach him the activity so that when he becomes an adult he can work on it if he so desires.  His daughter is not involved in the production of coffee because she works for a cell phone company.  Anselmo's coffee is organic and for the next season he needs to plant part of his ranch because the plants currently on it have reached their life cycle   and this is why he needs a loan.  If he achieves planting what he has planned, he will increase his production from 8 to 12 tonnes in 3 years.  Anselmo told us that when harvest is over he plans to open a grocery store in his house to increase the income for his

Since he was a young boy, his father would take him to the coffee fields so that he could help out, and over time, he learned everything to do with coffee production. The coffee that Pablo produces is organic, as he does not use fertilizers that contain chemical products. During the last harvest, he achieved the goal he had set out for himself: to produce 10 tons. For the following harvest, Pablo needs to plant new coffee plants because some of his have completed their life cycle. He is requesting a loan for this.

Therefore, she is now in the business of raising animals.  Her dream is to have a place where she could sell the animals.  She is requesting the loan to buy guinea pigs, chickens, and feed for the animals.\r\n\r\nThe members in the inset photo group had their picture taken later as they asked permission to do so due to work.\r\n\r\nThe other members' businesses include selling food, a grocery store, taxi service, selling vegetables, and selling wine.\r\n\r\nMarcelina is thankful to those who form part of her dream through the loans, and she promises to make her payments according to the established schedule.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":1183409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy guinea pigs, chickens, and feed for the animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2012-09-11T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-11T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Elezabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maruja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2688.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2794.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2905.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3011.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1031.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1072.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1115.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1155.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1031.64,"local_amount":2688.16,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2695.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308092424,"comment":null},{"amount":1072.58,"local_amount":2794.83,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2802.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315326421,"comment":null},{"amount":1115.11,"local_amount":2905.66,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322934923,"comment":null},{"amount":1155.67,"local_amount":3011.35,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3019.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331067370,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T01:48:31Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T11:54:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":469829,"name":"Shakhraia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shakhraia is 64 years old and lives in the Gardabani district.

She used the previous one to buy products she did not have in her store which helped her increase her clientele because having more variety of products in stock led to more customers coming.  Now, she expects to get this new loan and will use it to stock the store even more.  She will buy rice, sugar, oil, detergent, canned goods, stationery supplies and household items.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in the communal bank seven cycles and likes it because of the loans the institution provides.

La esposa de Efr\u00e9n muri\u00f3 hace algunos a\u00f1os sin embargo su animo no decae y est\u00e1 muy entusiasmado con la idea de obtener un cr\u00e9dito por parte de KIVA para poder aumentar su producci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9, la cual es en su totalidad org\u00e1nica. Efr\u00e9n quiere comprar planta de caf\u00e9 para resembrar en una parte de su parcela ya que las plantas que tiene all\u00ed ya han cumplido su ciclo de vida productiva. Terminando la cosecha a Efr\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda comprar una camioneta que utilizar\u00e1 para transportar su caf\u00e9 y para salir a pasear. ","en":"Efr\u00e9n has been growing coffee for more than fifty years. Like most producers, he learned everything he knows from his father, who also grew coffee. When Efr\u00e9n married, his father gave him a plot that he could work independently to provide for his new family. Efr\u00e9n does most of the farmwork himself. Sometimes he hires people to help him with the most arduous tasks because he is now 72 years old, and at this age he finds some of the work too difficult. \r\n\r\nThough his wife died several years ago, he has not lost heart and is very enthusiastic about obtaining a Kiva loan to increase his coffee production, which is completely organic. Efr\u00e9n wants to buy coffee plants to replace the plants on part of his land that are no longer productive. After the harvest, Efr\u00e9n would like to buy a truck to transport his coffee and to just take for a drive."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1184263,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy coffee plants and renovate his farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-09-11T19:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-11T19:10:10Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Efr\u00e9n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":12328.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810673,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T00:27:29Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470062,"name":"Verna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Verna is 34 years old, married and has one child.

She only received an elementary education because of the economic difficulties in her family, but thanks to her entrepreneurial spirit, which she inherited from her mother, she set up her own fast food business five years ago where she spends six hours a day, Monday through Friday, and 12 hours on weekends.  For Nancy, the loan she received through Fundacion Alternativa, financed by Kiva, helped her acquire the products she needed to add value to her business, which have increased her income so she can

They help each other and share their problems and solve the problems among them.  They celebrate their festivals together in their village.  \r\n\r\nBasanti, leader of the group, has six goats. The lady standing second from the left-hand side, and wearing a yellow saree is Basanti. She purchases the goat kids from the market and takes care of them. She provides vaccines and fodder to them when it is required. She sells them for meat to the local butcher shops when they are full grown. It takes 8-9 months for her to have them ready to sell. \r\n\r\nBasanti goes out in the morning to leave the goats to graze in the fields and returns by noon. Then she cooks for her family.  She resumes taking care of her goats by feeding them at home. Her husband assists her in selling and maintaining these goats.

Rose is the mother of two children, both of whom attend school and are her dependents. Rose lives alone with her children and is responsible for all the household expenses. Rose has had very little formal education.\r\n\r\nFor approximately the past eighteen years Rose has been selling food (rice and corn dough) in her district.

She currently has a neighborhood store and tells us she decided to start her business several years ago on her own initiative.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is currently taking out is to increase capital by purchasing rice, oil, and flour from distributing companies so that she can later sell them at her business location. This way of working allows her to generate resources to support her family as far as possible, since she is in a common-law marriage and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says she enjoys the trainings regarding loans and health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1184346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase rice, oil, and flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-09-11T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-11T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jehnny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Jhannet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":13636.35,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2727.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2727.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2727.29},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2727.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2727.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":394.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":790.01,"local_amount":5454.58,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5498.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260889,"comment":null},{"amount":395,"local_amount":2727.29,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2749.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490599,"comment":null},{"amount":395,"local_amount":2727.29,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2749.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095458,"comment":null},{"amount":394.99,"local_amount":2727.19,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2749.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235533,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T23:12:32Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:44:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467940,"name":"Nuestra Esperanza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal nuestra esperanza esta conformado por 8 integrantes todas son mujeres comprendida en la edades de 35 a 50 anos con 20 hijos bajo su responsabilidad.

Ruth is 18 years old and lives in the town of Bulenga in the Kampala West region of Uganda. For the past 2 years, Ruth has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soda, beer and sugar. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Ruth has requested a loan of UGX800,000 from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more rice, posho (a type of porridge) and drinks to sell, and will help Ruth to generate greater profits and allow her to buy bed nets for her family. Ruth hopes that in the future she will be able to set up another shop. \r\n\r\nRuth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is a native of the city Puri, but she lives in the village Balugaon of Odisha, India. Kumudin is a housewife who is very happy and responsible. She alternates her household activities with work in her business. She has a business of growing vegetables and paddy and selling them in the market of the Khurda district of Odisha, India. She has had this business for four years and it is going very well. \r\n\r\nAt this time, Kumudin is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers, seeds and new and advanced tools for farming.

During harvest time they contract laborers to help them with the cutting because there's too much work for them to do alone, and this way they contribute financially to the families of the people they hire. In the last harvest, Alberto and his children produced 8 tons of coffee, all of which they turned over to the \"Union Regional de Huatusco\" to be processed and exported. \r\n\r\nFor the next harvest, Alberto asks for a loan because he needs to clean and plant his fields. Within a year he plans to buy another hectare of land so that he can increase his production and his estate. Another thing that Alberto would like to buy is a vehicle to transport his coffee.

One of them is Mrs. Laxmipriya, who was selected as their president. The lady standing in the middle, wearing an orange saree, is Laxmipriya.\r\n\r\nLaxmipriya  is 50 years old and is living with her husband and her two children. Her husband is a farmer who has been farming for a long time. She got the idea of growing vegetables from her husband. She gathered some other women from her neighborhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. Initially, she started with growing only a few vegetables like potatos, tomatoes and onions, but later on she grew bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumber, lady finger and<i> brinjal<\/i> (eggplant).

She wisely has used her past loans to cater for her children and better her business and her household. \r\n\r\nFor this loan cycle, she and another two clients -- one of whom is a sixth-time borrower, and the remaining one an eight-time borrower -- are borrowing as a group. As the group leader, Hean will use her loan portion to pay for harvesting. She hopes to grow her rice in a timely manner so as to sustain the good progress of her lifestyle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1190478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay for harvesting.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ek Phnom district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-12T05:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-12T05:20:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1700000},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1400000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1419600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288722,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":912600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197253,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":912600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399941999,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T07:54:18Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:53:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470178,"name":"Agdam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agdam is 32 years old, married and has one daughter.

They stay at home organizing suitcases which they use to take the clothing out to sell, and come home between midday and 1:30 to prepare the lunch for their children. Then, during the evening, they go to church. They buy the products they need for their business in a city. To get there, they need to walk for about 15 minutes, and then take a bus for 30 minutes before arriving at their destination.\r\n\r\nMiguel plans to use his loan to buy two dozen skirts, blouses, bras, women\u2019s underwear, socks, men\u2019s underwear and boxer shorts, handkerchiefs, etc. He plans to use this money to meet the need for better items, as his customers request things which they cannot supply due to a lack of money. They also go to buy items every eight days, and with the loan they will be able to buy for the whole month, so that they can buy at better prices and with more variety. Miguel and his wife do all they can to give their children a better quality of life, and their goal is to ensure that they finish university, but Miguel has not been able to do this yet due to a lack of resources.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1180820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy two dozen skirts, blouses, bras, women\u2019s underwear, socks, men\u2019s underwear and boxer shorts, handkerchiefs, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-09-12T10:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-12T10:00:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Ram\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":54.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":61.74},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.02,"local_amount":106.02,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":106.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383067,"comment":null},{"amount":55.47,"local_amount":55.47,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":55.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990148,"comment":null},{"amount":57.21,"local_amount":57.21,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":57.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331970460,"comment":null},{"amount":58.56,"local_amount":58.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":58.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517184,"comment":null},{"amount":58.21,"local_amount":58.21,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":58.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069026,"comment":null},{"amount":61.34,"local_amount":61.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":61.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356495294,"comment":null},{"amount":303.19,"local_amount":303.19,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":303.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T06:25:34Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470796,"name":"Twige Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Henriette fait partie du groupe Twige et  habite \u00e0 Cibitoke.

He is known to be a hard-working person, who has an entrepreneurial spirit and is highly dedicated to his family and their prosperity. He has worked as a farmer since his childhood, and enjoys what he does. He has a lot of experience, and harvests 30 sacks of beans per 7,000 square meters sown. His only limitation is the financial resources he lacks to expand his crop harvest.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 buys his agricultural supplies in a city which is very far from where he lives. It\u2019s difficult to travel there as there is no transportation where Jos\u00e9 lives. The most usual way is to go by horse, and this is why it is so difficult to transport the supplies.\r\n\r\nThe loan Jos\u00e9 has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will be used to buy seven sacks of fertilizers, two gallons of herbicide, and bean seeds to sow 7,000 square meters of beans.

Likewise, he will ensure that his crops have the fertilizers at the right time, so that he can have a larger harvest and greater income, which he hopes will give his family what they need in terms of health and the education of his children.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 hopes that this loan will offer an alternative to allow him to do things that aren\u2019t easy for him due to his limited resources, such as educating his children and making improvements to his home.

in the city of Pisco with her parents and her little son.  In spite of being young, she is a very kind, hard-working, and enthusiastic person who has a great desire to succeed.  Sadly, for various reasons, she separated from her life partner.  Ever since then she has been father and mother to her little one.  In her free time she likes to play sports.  Sometimes she makes the delicious duck with rice to share with her family.  Liliana was not able to study for a career in gastronomy as she so wanted to do.  However, she hopes to be able to do so very soon.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, and with support from her mother, Liliana started her small business of selling beauty products.  She devotes approximately 12 hours a day to her business.  During that time she is able to tend to a good number of customers.  Liliana believes that her business is going well because of the good products that she sells and the kind and respectful way that she treats her customers.\r\n\r\nLiliana is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.

Al principio fue muy dif\u00edcil para ellos pero con el paso del tiempo fueron aprendiendo todo lo relacionado con el caf\u00e9 y lograron remediar esta dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n. Guillermo actualmente tiene 53 a\u00f1os y cuenta con much\u00edsima experiencia en el cultivo del caf\u00e9.

Guillermo y su esposa Tere tienen una hija de 15 a\u00f1os y a ellos les gustar\u00eda poder brindarle en un futuro la oportunidad de salir a estudiar una carrera universitaria ya que la comunidad en donde viven es peque\u00f1a y no cuenta con muchas opciones educativas ni de empleo. ","en":"When Guillermo was six years old, his father died and he and his mother and brothers had to work very hard to get ahead. At first it was very hard for them, but as time went by, they learned everything about coffee and were able to remedy their difficult situation. Guillermo is now 53 years old and has much experience in the coffee growing. He personally manages his land and during the harvest he hires workers to help him, as there is too much work to do and it would be impossible for him to finish it all by himself. Guillermo's last harvest yielded 8 tons of coffee beans, which he gave to the Regional Union of Huatusco (Union Regional de Huatusco) to be processed and exported. For the next harvest he needs a loan in order to invest in cleaning his land and preparing the soil for sowing new plants, as some of the ones he has have completed their production cycle. When we spoke to Guillermo about KIVA, he was enthusiastic because he knows that after the harvest he\u2019ll have enough money to payback the loan; the difference between other jobs and working in the field is that in the field, generating income takes longer. Guillermo and his wife Tere have a 15-year-old daughter and in the future they\u2019d like to be able to offer her the opportunity to get out and go to university, as the small town they live in has very few options for education or jobs.
