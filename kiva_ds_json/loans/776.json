Since then he is also able to sell meat, mostly grilled chicken. Meat is rather expensive to buy in his city; however, fried chicken or other poultry is usually part of the typical meal. Because electricity problems make it difficult for individual households to keep meat, baked products are well sought after.\r\n\r\nFaruk took a loan from Relief International - Iraq in the amount of $2,700 to continue his store's improvement, and to be able to stock the store with the items he used to sell before the introduction of the grilling oven as well as to continue to produce the baked meat products.

","en":"The Nianghou Ndierignou group is composed of women from the same neighborhood who have formed a \"tontine\" (a revolving system whereby each member contributes periodically an agreed amount and this is passed on in rotation to the different members). They trade in groceries, notably vegetables, fish and basic food products. The sell their goods on tables that are installed in the small neighborhood market or, in some cases, in front of their houses. They are all married with several children. The leader of the group (dressed in a black \"boubou\" on the right) sells fresh, smoked and dried fish as well as vegetables. She gets her supplies of perishable food every evening from the large market in her town and sells them early the next day to her customers. She manages to generate sufficient income to help her husband provide for their family's food, clothing, and education.

He graduated from the Kapan construction vocational school and is a construction worker by trade. Garnik is married and has two children. Garnik's wife is a homemaker; his older daughter studies in the civil engineering faculty at the Kapan Polytechnical Institute; and his younger daughter finished secondary school this year.\r\n\r\nGarnik has been doing shoe repairs for 20 years. Ganik has his own machines and shoe molds, but he leases the shop where he operates his business. Once a month he purchases materials in the city of Erevan.\r\n\r\nGarnik always has many clients because he does high-quality and quick work. Garnik works late into the evening, which allows clients to stop by at the end of their work day.\r\n\r\nThanks to his own business Garnik supports his family and pays for the education of his older daughter. Garnik needs a loan of 1,000,000 dram to acquire equipment (a machine for sewing chains to boots) for his workshop, as well as to purchase materials (leather, soles,

In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.

She is married with 3 children, between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Two of her children are currently attending nursery school. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Isata established her water purifying business. She began her business because she thinks that a lot of citizens are suffering and want to drink pure water. She says that the main challenges to her business are waste of plastic and insufficient electricity power supply. She has 10 employees working for her.

raising five children.  Her family's primary business is animal husbandry and farming.  In 2005, Salkyngul decided to get involved in fattening up and reselling livestock, having invested an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock.  Today, her business contains ten sheep, one bull and one horse, and yields a monthly income of 8,000 som.  The profits from her business allow Salkyngul to pay for her oldest son's education.  In order to further develop her business, Salkyngul requested a loan in the sum of 110,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase sheep.  She plans to direct the profits from the loan to the remodeling of her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":993404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T16:50:04Z","loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salkyngul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":863.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":755.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":755.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":863.64,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40254.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070976,"comment":null},{"amount":1511.36,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":70444.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459401,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T21:08:15Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385846,"name":"Ulmas","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0423\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0418\u0441\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0430. \u0415\u0439 51 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u043a\u0438, \u043c\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430, \u044f\u0438\u0446, \u0448\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0442.","en":"Ulmas lives in the city of Isfara.

Lilian has worked for a long time to get her family ahead, and for the moment, she's the one who continues to fight to improve their living conditions. Her husband is retired and cannot keep on working due to an illness that prevents him from doing a lot of things. Lilian owns a snack bar at a local private school where she sells snacks to students. Besides, on weekends and in the afternoons she sells typical food such as nu\u00e9gados (a type of sweet), atoles (a type of drink), fried yucca, enchiladas, etc. at  her home. She succeeded in establishing and maintaining both businesses for many years with a lot of hard work. She is very well-known in her neighborhood because she is an enterprising, hardworking and charismatic woman. Her dream is to provide education for her children so that she can see them become professionals with better living conditions than she and her husband had. All of that motivates her to keep on working in order to achieve her dream one day. She has decided to request this loan from INTEGRAL in order to invest it in her business by purchasing goods (beans, beverages, snacks, buns, milk, rice, sugar, coffee, paper, etc.) that will allow her to increase her profits. That way she can continue to pursue the means necessary to put food on her family's table and therefore fulfill her life's dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":991799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase beans, beverages, snacks, buns, milk, rice, sugar, coffee, paper, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.09},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.72},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82.05,"local_amount":82.05,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":82.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241339,"comment":null},{"amount":80.64,"local_amount":80.64,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269966290,"comment":null},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276573578,"comment":null},{"amount":79.98,"local_amount":79.98,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":79.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283319155,"comment":null},{"amount":81.99,"local_amount":81.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":81.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049451,"comment":null},{"amount":85.65,"local_amount":85.65,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":85.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521094,"comment":null},{"amount":88.06,"local_amount":88.06,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329736,"comment":null},{"amount":91.24,"local_amount":91.24,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":91.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349566,"comment":null},{"amount":337.39,"local_amount":337.39,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":337.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315320936,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T22:43:07Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:15:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384902,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia Zenaida; continua con su negocio de compra y venta de artesan\u00eda,  la socia compra algunos adornos hechos en arcillas y otro grupo los hace, ella compra la por mayor y vende al por menor o en unidades, la socia amplio un poco el local para exhibir su artesania y ahora desea comprar mercaderia para vender.

moved to Miami from Peru in 1990 and since his arrival, has worked diligently to build his credit history.  Like many immigrant entrepreneurs, Ruben realized that without credit it would be difficult to secure business capital from a commercial bank. For three years, Ruben received credit counseling while working two jobs - as a full time cook at Pollo Tropical and part-time at a packaging company - all to save money for his business. In 2000, as a result of Ruben\u2019s determination and hard work, he was able to start an exporting business that initially relied heavily on his connection in Peru, a large buyer of medical hearing devices. Recently, Ruben has been approached by buyers all over Latin America and he needs capital to respond to the growing demand.  By raising capital for Ruben\u2019s loan, he will be able to purchase the inventory he needs to export medical hearing devices overseas.

started her business because of her passion for helping people. It is that same passion that has helped her grow her business from one customer a day to thirty a day. She believes that her mobile money business is vital for her community, which is just learning about the new technology of sending money using cellular phones. \r\n\r\nHer proudest moment so far when it comes to her business is getting her very first customer who she had to convince to send money using her service; she had to educate the person and will never forget the feeling she got when that one customer was able to use her service, fully understand it, and come back for more transactions. To Aness, educating people about mobile money is just as important as the transactions. \r\n\r\nAt 25, Aness is expecting her first child; she lives in a small border town with her long-time boyfriend. She faces many challenges like living in an area that is very far from where her shop is located, but the biggest one of all is that her working capital is not enough to satisfy her ever growing customer base and does not give her enough profits. As such she is forced to constantly be moving to and from the bank to convert her cash to electronic and vice versa. When Aness gets her loan she wants to increase her working capital and get some chairs for her booth so that her customers can be comfortable and she can better educate them about mobile money. \r\n\r\nIn her picture, Aness is standing by her booth which she uses to serve her customers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3064.8,"image":{"id":976009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To

is a 30 year old divorced mother of two. She runs her own store as a Champion Agent for Mobile Transactions in Solwezi providing money transfer services to her community. She started her business in July 2011 because she has always wanted to have a business of her own and when the opportunity came through Mobile Transactions, she took it. Within a month of starting her business Angela was already doing more than 1000 money transfers a month. \r\n\r\nAccess to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, 80% of the population, do not have bank accounts. As most Zambians live in rural areas, distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Mobile Transactions Zambia Limited (MTZL) is an early stage company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction service by propagating an open network using small businesses called Champion Agents. Angela is a Champion Agent. This is her story. \r\n\r\nAngela believes her community benefits from her business in a very positive way because the service she provides is faster compared to other money transfer services and more often has enough cash to pay out receiving customers. She currently has one employee and two teller windows, which she uses to serve her customers. \r\n\r\nWhen Angela receives her loan she will be able to increase her float money (electronic and cash value of her working capital) which will enable her to satisfy more customers. She also wants to use the loan money to pay for her booth which she is currently using to serve her customers. Angela is hopeful that once she has increased her float money she will be able to earn more commissions and have enough money to have her children, who are currently living with her parents in Lusaka province 12 hours away, come live with her. \r\n\r\nIn the video, a representative of MTZL interviews Angela."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":944523,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2514,"youtubeId":"T6SMGoCgKQc","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Angela from  Zambia","thumbnailImageId":944523},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for her booth and increase her electronic and cash working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Solwezi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T22:20:04Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":177,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":399.03,"local_amount":399.03,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":399.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276926971,"comment":null},{"amount":430.97,"local_amount":430.97,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":430.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283208766,"comment":null},{"amount":556.14,"local_amount":556.14,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":556.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287634820,"comment":null},{"amount":639.1,"local_amount":639.1,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":639.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294480087,"comment":null},{"amount":727.84,"local_amount":727.84,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:15:48Z","rounded_local_amount":727.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301533498,"comment":null},{"amount":547.77,"local_amount":547.77,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-30T08:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":547.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308301560,"comment":null},{"amount":776.63,"local_amount":776.63,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":776.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533399,"comment":null},{"amount":770.38,"local_amount":770.38,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":770.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323132501,"comment":null},{"amount":152.14,"local_amount":152.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":152.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281395,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

He is requesting a loan of 300,000 cfa francs to purchase sacks of hay, millet and wheat for resale. His goal is to grow the business.

He devotes himself to his business around three hours, getting up very early since he must feed the pigs and clean the area where they eat, because, Daniel tells us, they are like people in that where it's clean they eat well but if it's dirty they don't like it. He believes his business is going well because he's very dedicated to his work and because he raises the animals with respect. \r\n\r\nDaniel is very happy for the help offered by the Kiva lenders, since owing to that support he will be able to purchase commercial feed wholesale (since when one buys in small quantities it is very expensive). With this improvement he will be able to provide better nutrition to the pigs and thus the customers will be more confident in buying their meat. Above all he will have more income to be able to fulfill his great dream: \"that his son would stay in school in order to be better than him, because the only thing he can leave him as an inheritance, in case something were to happen to him, is education.\" \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":991846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase feed for pigs.

Teodora also sells soft drinks and juice made from regional fruits such as cocona, aguaje and star fruit. \r\n\r\nIn the evenings Teodora sells kebabs, which are heartily welcomed by visitors.

Donia also set up a business in the front of her house, where she sells refreshments, gelatin, and soft drinks. On weekends, she also prepares \"Patasca\" (a concentrated soup made from beef or ram giblets and corn). She has regular customers so she never lacks for customers and always sells down to the last plate.\r\n\r\nDonia considers her biggest disadvantage to be a lack of capital for expanding her planting and improving her business.

He also does home gas delivery in the mornings, works in his internet business in the afternoon, and studies for a degree in Administration in the evenings.\r\n\r\nHe is a proactive and determined young man, as he divides his time among the three activities. He tells us that you can achieve everything; all you need is to have faith and do things with enthusiasm. He thinks that it's going well with his business because he is very organized, serves customers well, and also because his sister helps him lot when he isn't in the caf\u00e9.\r\n\r\nJaime is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help he will be able to buy two more computers for his business. This way he will have more machines available to serve customers, and they will be more satisfied with his services. This way he will have more income, so that he will be able  to continue saving, and fulfill his greatest dreams:  \"Completing his university degree, expanding his business, and being his parents' pride.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":991802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

This line of work allows her to generate an income to make a life for herself, as she is single. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she liked about Pro Mujer, Karina responded that she liked the area of health.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":991876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-01-28T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-27T06:10:03Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ximena\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anahy Lizeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21212.1,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3028.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.89},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.9},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":442.89,"local_amount":3030.55,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3039.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133059,"comment":null},{"amount":442.9,"local_amount":3030.55,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3039.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749871,"comment":null},{"amount":442.89,"local_amount":3030.55,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3039.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243355,"comment":null},{"amount":442.89,"local_amount":3030.55,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3039.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516224,"comment":null},{"amount":442.9,"local_amount":3030.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3039.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441163,"comment":null},{"amount":442.89,"local_amount":3030.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3039.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495124,"comment":null},{"amount":442.64,"local_amount":3028.8,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3037.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260704,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-30T14:56:07Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385732,"name":"Cornelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cornelia is 51 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Family expenses are increasing, and that's why she has to improve her income through increasing her Brazilian Gold collection and to support the cosmetics trade she started earlier. For this reason, she is applying for a loan from KIVA Partner \"Al Majmoua\". She is one of Al Majmoua's loyal borrowers, and now she's applying for her 13th loan cycle, with an excellent reputation and paying back history. She believes that Al Majmoua is the most important reason for her business improvement.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to open a jewelry shop one day to rest from seeking after customers, and to keep her house just for her family's rest and not to accept customers in it.

They live in their own house where the family rule is mutual help and understanding.  Even as a boy, Calixto worked hard, helping his parents on their farm, but for the past 30 years he has made a living farming his own land, growing cacao.  His creativity and drive to get ahead have paid off.  His cacao beans are especially valued for their quality and bring him a good living.  He can normally operate the farm alone but he has to hire day laborers to help him harvest his crop.  The extra help allows him to bring the crop in faster and ensures a better yield.  For the future, he wants to continue expanding production so that he can meet demand from his customers and improve his quality of life.  This will be Calixto's first MFP loan.  He is grateful for your support and confidence because your loan will allow him to proceed with his plans for the business.

In the mornings, she works at a house where she cooks and cleans. From that, she is paid a monthly salary. In the afternoons she supervises the lumber mill that she rents to some people who pay her on a monthly basis. Since the land was inherited by both her and her brother, they divide the earnings equally. In the evenings, she takes care of the market in her town, where the owners pay her for her services. These activities allow her to earn a living, and above all, pay for the university education of her two sons, who study law and political science in a private institution. This is her fourth loan with MFP, and she hopes that through her collaboration with MFP, she can realize her plans. She is committed to making her loan payments.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.

It\u2019s a neighbourhood where formal businesses are mixed in with informal businesses, recreational areas, family homes, and apartments. Most importantly for Colombians, it contains the Metropolitan Stadium, one of the most important places for professional football in the country. It\u2019s the home of Junior, a much-loved team from the Caribbean coast.\r\n\r\nThis is where Carmen has her business. She sells medicines, stationery, and various other items as well as offering cellular phone service. She began this business in 2008 after selling clothes for over thirty years. The store is open seven days a week from 7am to 10pm. These long hours are very competitive and will result in many potential customers who recognize that Carmen offers very good prices and unequalled service. \r\n\r\nThe anticipated growth of the business has made Carmen think of the need for more working capital so she can buy in greater volume and get discounted prices.
