Several times, Inga has requested loans from local financial institutions for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salary earned by Inga, who is working as a saleslady. \r\n\r\nInga requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nInga will purchase clothes in Turkey at wholesale prices and resell them in her district for a profit. It will be hard work for Inga, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and will increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in her clothing trading business to increase her stock and sales volume. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1259384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She was one of the first Yellow Leaf weavers and will be a member of our inaugural Kiva microloan class.\n\nThrough a zero-interest Kiva loan and the Yellow Leaf distribution network, her family will have guaranteed weaving income and financial stability for the first time in 2013. This is a tremendous step for a woman born in Yalana\u2019s circumstances.  \n\nYalana was born in the jungles of rural northern Thailand at the end of an era for her tribe, the Mlabri. When she was a young lady life rapidly changed as deforestation destroyed much of the jungles in which the Mlabri had lived for generations.  Without any land rights or capital to farm, she, along with the rest of the tribe, eventually became indentured servants working in the fields of the more aggressive tribes in the area.\n\nHer father was a respected sorcerer and very knowledgeable about traditional Mlabri life.  As encroaching logging and agriculture overwhelmed traditional ways of life, she found herself with few alternatives to servitude. \n\nHammock weaving presented an excellent opportunity!  Today she lives in the Ban Bunyuen village and helps provide for her family by applying her traditional artisan talents toward weaving hammocks that are sold around the world.  \n\nShe has acquired enough independence to be able to plant rice fields for her family, generally harvesting enough grain to last from one harvest to the next.  Hunting and foraging continue to play a role in her family\u2019s daily sustenance, but they are no longer limited to what they can hunt, trap, catch or kill; her income from making hammocks affords them healthcare, education, and food security formerly unavailable to them.\n\nWith her past way of life no longer viable, she has adjusted to her new situation while maintaining her pride and confidence in being a Mlabri person.\n\nWith this loan, not only will she will be able to make more money, but she can create a stockpile of hammocks during the off season to ensure a steady flow of income throughout the year.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1259084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to pay for yarn and ensure a steady flow of income throughout the year.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\"yalana\" Duangpon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"THB","disbursal_amount":15417,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15417}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":15417,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-01T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":16058.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381854110,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T22:00:40Z","paid_date":"2013-08-01T09:27:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509230,"name":"Yadi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yadi is an artisan weaver living in rural northern Thailand. She is a member of a marginalized hill tribe community known as the Mlabri. \n\nFor almost 1,000 years, the Mlabri lived as a gentle, peaceful hunter-gatherer society, secluded from the outside world. Rapid deforestation, reckless development and warfare in the mid-20th century robbed them of their jungle home and nearly destroyed the tribe's unique lifestyle- they were forced to labor in toxic slash & burn agriculture as indentured servants. Malaria and malnourishment decimated the tribe- they are listed on UNESCO's endangered languages list with just 300 Mlabri left in the world.\n\nYadi was born in the jungles to a traditional Mlabri family as the world around them fell apart. She spent all of her growing up years working as a laborer in the fields, feeling that she had no options to take control of her future. When the opportunity to weave hammocks came along, she leapt at it! She was among the first group to learn and perfect hammock weaving and she has never gone back to being a hired hand again. \n\nYadi would like to improve her home-based weaving operation, where she can watch over her younger children, and invest in raw materials so she can secure consistent weaving work and increase her income potential. \n\nYadi is married with six children and she has helped ensure each of them receives the formal education she was denied. The healthy, stable income from weaving hammocks has helped Yadi engineer a turnaround and pull her culture back from the brink of extinction.

She is also kind and cordial. Her partner is Eber, who is employed. She lives in the company of only her partner, comfortably set up in their own home, which they built with much effort. Diva is a dressmaker, a trade that she learned studying in a center for occupational education. She then bought a sewing machine with her savings, which she installed in her own home, where she serves her customers who seek her out for her good finishing touches. She succeeds in gaining their acceptance and thus they recommend her to other people who then become her regular customers. She started in this business more than 1 year ago, and until this moment she does it alone. She considers her business profitable because of the profits that it brings her.\r\n\r\nShe likes the trade of dressmaking because of the occupation that it offers her, which is useful to her to support her partner in settling the expenses of their home. But she comments that she feels a little uncomfortable from the physical tiredness from being seated in the same posture which causes her shoulder pain, but this does not discourage her and she continues working and making efforts.

She began it herself with the capital from a private loan.\r\n\r\nShe says she like her job because she enjoys cooking (having learned from her mother the secrets to a good seasoning) as well as for the financial income that allows her to pay her bills and cover the household expenses.  On the contrary, she does not like it due to the physical fatigue from having to get up very early in the morning to make preparations for the day.  But this does not discourage her and she carries on with her work, which is why she wishes to grow her business and improve her roof so she can more comfortably tend to her customers.  Thus, this will be her 16th loan with the MFP institution, and with it she hopes to be able to settle her plans.

is one of Relief International Microfinance Iraq programs' successful clients who have been featured on Kiva before. With the support of Kiva lenders, she is making small but significant improvements to her sewing and tailoring business.\r\n\r\nShirin continues doing great work from her home-based sewing business. Using her previous loan, which she has successfully repaid, she was able to purchase a new sewing machine with an old stand and a chair. While in the past, she was working on a small machine mounted on a small wooden stool that she had to sit next to on the floor and bend over while working, she is now able to work in a more comfortable position. She is now able to work more hours and satisfy more customers with her services. \r\n\r\nTo make further improvements to her small business, she is now taking a new loan of 2,400 USD. She would like to make her work area a better and nicer place for her work. As an example, she imagines some nice small furniture items to better store her work materials and orders, which currently line the floor in small bags. She would also like to buy some nice good quality fabrics and raw materials to work with, making it easier for her to create quality products for her customers, and help support her family.\r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

El \u00fanico problema que enfrenta es en la temporada de lluvia ya que las ventas bajan. Una de sus metas es establecer una distribuidora de helados m\u00e1s amplio y con mucha mayor productividad.

His wife does household chores and also helps him with the business.  Santos used to be employed by an ice-cream selling firm and he then decided to start his own business.  He started out selling with just a small freezer and a bicycle.  Currently, Santos has a bigger freezer and three bicycles to distribute ice-cream and covers a larger sales area.  He has two employees and his work day starts at 7am and ends at 6pm.  \r\n\r\nThe loan Santos is asking for is needed to buy ingredients to make ice-cream and to buy a bicycle to help him cover his entire market.  This loan will change Santos\u2019 life because he\u2019s not had enough money to buy the necessary merchandise to meet customer demand.  The only problem he faces is the rainy season when sales drop.   One of his goals is to open a larger ice-cream distributing center with much more productivity.  This is his first FAMA loan and he intends to make his payments punctually.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1260229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

","en":"Jaime, 43, is a street vendor who makes a living selling natural fruits such as strawberries, kiwi, apples, and grapes.  He started this business after having a store where he sold meals and provisions in small quantities, but it didn't live up to his expectations of profitability.\r\n\r\nLittle by little he saved and rented a little cart.  He bought fruit and began to sell it throughout the streets near his neighborhood.  He also added the famous tutti frutti, a fruit salad prepared with soda and chopped fruit sweetened with honey and served on ice, becoming a delicious drink that pacifies the immense heat of the warm Caribbean sun and climate.\r\n\r\nThese days he goes out with his own fruit cart and visits all the streets of the neighborhood and other places near his home.  He has a  customer base of 150 buyers.\r\n\r\nCurrently he's applying for a Kiva loan, his second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to continue growing in his business.  With the previous loan he increased his working capital.  With the Kiva loan he's applying for now, he hopes to respond to the Christmas and New Year season with seasonal fruits such as grapes, which are part of the toast of every family.\r\n\r\nThe tradition is for all the members of the family to eat 12 grapes at the end of the night on December 31 and request for themselves 12 desires for prosperity.  This is precisely what makes his Kiva loan effective.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1038.1,"image":{"id":1259832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband Mahmoud appears in her Kiva profile photo next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nSabreen is a 34-year-old married woman

Sabreen is a housewife and her husband is a taxi driver.\r\n\r\nFor the past four years, Sabreen's husband has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and the only source of income for the family, but from time to time, he needs more support to cover necessary costs.\r\n\r\nSabreen is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing a new engine for the taxi he drives and make some repairs to it such as installing new mirrors and lights. This will increase the taxi capacity to work extra hours and enable Sabreen's husband to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a 33-year-old married woman. She has seven children. She describes herself to be a social woman. She operates a grocery store where she sells vegetables and fruits. She has been involved in this business for 15 years. Her business is located in an urban area and her primary customers are local residents. She describes her biggest business challenge to be insufficient funds for improving the business.

He lives in a home of his own with his wife, 45 year old Nancy, and his lovely 18 year old daughter, to whom he wants to provide a brighter future.  Besides his daughter, he also has two adult sons already on their own, whom he taught like a good father, and he worked to provide the best for them.  Eliu\u2019s work consists of making sure that the streets of the city of Pucallpa are safer.  Being a watchman has made him well liked by his neighbors, because they know the dangers to which he is exposed at night, and the courage he has for facing them.  Although things are going well for him in this job, his salary is not enough to provide his family with a dignified life, so a few months ago he started a grocery store, which his wife manages and with which he was able to increase his income in part.  Since he began his business, he has had many difficulties, such as not knowing how to manage it, but over time he gained experience and has been improving each day.  \r\n\r\nHe is happy in his job, since it\u2019s very satisfying to know that thanks to his job, people can sleep soundly.  He has been doing this for four years and he considers the most difficult thing is having to stay up all night, given the things that happen in the city.

Kholida must meet her own expenses, as well as provide clothing and schooling for the children.  \r\n\r\nIn order to develop her business and earn a larger income, Kholida works very hard.  Because of her good service, she has a large client base.  However, many of her competitors have embroidery machines and many people prefer seamstresses who are able to embroider.  If Kholida doesn't also buy an embroidery machine and offer this service, she will lose all her clients.  She needs an embroidery machine, but her income isn't enough for her to buy one.  She is requesting a loan of 3,500 somoni (TJS) to buy an embroidery machine.  She is relying on you and your

He is a very energetic person, and each moment brings him a new source of inspiration. Asror is 35 years old, married, and raising 3 young children who attend secondary school. The climate of Asror's home is very favourable to cultivating crops and animal husbandry, and so he has been raising cattle and growing grapes for over 17 years. Asror sells the cattle after taking care of it for several months, and has many customers at the local market. His wife helps him with the business.\r\n\r\nAsror would like to develop his business but lacks the funds to do so. He is requesting a loan of 1000 somoni to purchase cattle and thereby expand his enterprise. Asror is a returning client of IMON International, has a good credit history, and promises to repay the loan on time. He plans to use his additional profits to provide his children with good education and access to modern technologies. Asror is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1259494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He is married to a wonderful woman, Zuhro, who helps him with his business. Huseyn has 4 children, two of whom are of the age of majority, while two are younger. Together with his family, Huseyn lives in an agricultural area, and so it was natural for him, 20 years ago, to launch his business of cultivating grains and grapes. He mainly grows wheat, as it is in high demand at the local market. Huseyn's two oldest sons help their father with the business.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue to provide his family with all necessities of life, Huseyn wants to develop his business, and for that he needs to increase his harvest. He is planning to do a winter sowing of wheat, but lacks the funds to purchase seeds or mineral fertilizers after spending all his money on his family's needs. Huseyn is requesting a loan of 2000 somoni in order to buy mineral fertilizers and seeds. He promises to repay the loan on time. He will use his business profits to give good education to his children and improve the quality of their life. Huseyn needs and is counting on your

Over the course of preparing her loan, Shaikul showed herself to be responsible, conscientious, and enterprising, with a sense of duty, as well as knowing how to properly manage her financial resources and invest them in the right things.  Since 1996, Shaikul has been in the business of animal husbandry and farming, which are the primary source of income for the family.  She began her business with 2,000 KGS, and thanks to her hard work, her business now brings her about 8,000 KGS per month, which serves as the basis for covering her family's food and other household needs.  \r\n\r\nShaikul also has 1.80 hectares, where she cultivates wheat and perennial grasses.  Over the years, her business has become very well developed.  She now has two horses and 15 sheep.  The income from her business has allowed Shaikul to give her children an education.

Turumkan has a secondary-level education and until 1996, she worked on a collective farm.  She is a very calm and hardworking person.  In search of a source of income for her family, in 1996 Turumkan started her own business in animal husbandry and farming with a starting capital of 2,000 som (KGS).  As a result of her persistence and hard work, Turumkan developed her business to where it now has a monthly income of 6,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products.\r\n\r\nTo increase her family's income, Turumkan must increase the size of her herd.  She applied to Bai tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy four cows.

is 51 years old and lives in the town of Fortportal in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is widowed and has 4 children. For the past 17 years, she has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Gorrette has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil, sugar and salt to attract more customers, and will help her to generate greater profits and improve on her family's standard of living. She hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a big supermarket in town. \r\n\r\nGorrette is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Gorrette who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1259715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The loan will be used to increase her stock of essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil and sugar, as well as a fridge to attract more customers.

He is a very energetic and motivated person.  His wife is a good and proper woman.  She works for a small salary that isn't enough to provide for the family, so Asliddin is the family's main breadwinner.  For a number of years he has earned his living growing crops, like wheat, and various grains, which he sells at the market.  He manages his own business.  He would like to expand the business in order to provide his family with all its needs, so he has to harvest a higher yield.  He is seeking a loan for 2000 soms to buy mineral fertilizers.  He's got big plans for the future if he gets a good harvest; once he makes the income he'll buy essential equipment that his family has needed for many years.  Asliddin is a respectable man and promises to pay off the loan on time.  He needs and awaits your beneficence.

Zuhrohon makes masterpieces of traditional Tajik dresses.  She is 42 years old, married, and has four children.  Her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation and is saving money for the children's future.  Zuhrohon has to deal with all the daily expenses herself.  To earn an income, she began her business three years ago.  She works from home.  Because of her good service, she has a large customer base.  Her eldest daughter helps her run the business. \r\n\r\nSince she uses her income to buy food and clothing for the children, Zuhrohon can't save money for a television and refrigerator.  For several years now, they have had problems without a refrigerator.  She can't keep food fresh, and it spoils quickly.  Her children are begging her to buy a television and refrigerator.

She is married and raising three children. Her husband has a taxi service for local residents. Mahbuba is a very competent woman. Thanks to her parents, she graduated and for more than ten years has been working at a school in her region as a primary school teacher. She loves her profession and does her work with pleasure, but she gets a small salary which is not enough to support a family. \r\n\r\nIn order to learn sewing and cutting, over the summer she took a course and learned how to sew women's national dresses. She plans to organize her own business sewing women's clothing, because there is great demand. In her region, there are few dressmakers and all the women go to dressmakers in the city to sew their dresses. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 1,000 Somoni to buy a sewing machine. She is awaiting and hoping for your kindness. This loan will help her to organize the business and thus improve her living conditions.

The loan will be used to buy more clothes that will be sold, and will help Mirembe to generate greater profits, boost the business and pay school fees for her children. Mirembe hopes that in the future she will be able to stock more clothes to be sold in the festive season. \r\n\r\nMirembe is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

","en":"Boginiso is 48 years old. She is married and has two adult children. Her son is 23 years old and her daughter is 18. \r\n\r\nBoginiso has more than six years experience in sewing women's clothing. She sews dresses at her home and has regular customers. She deals with the business on her own. Her husband receives a small salary and thus Boginiso is the main breadwinner in the family. \r\n\r\nHer son plans to marry his girlfriend this year.

","en":"Hasan has a huge heart and a good soul. He is a \"person with a capital P\" and therefore has the respect of many people. He is 45 years old. He is married and has three children. Hasan is trying to keep his family living with abundance, and with this goal he began his own business 19 years ago manufacturing and selling windows and doors. \r\n\r\nHe is a master woordworker with \"golden hands\" and manufactures high quality and beautiful windows and doors in a modern design style. Thanks to excellent service, he has a wide range of customers. Hasan copes the business on his own, as none of the family members helps him in the business. His products are sold mainly in the north of Tajikistan, and the quality of the work never disappoints. \r\n\r\nSince the last time, there is more demand for his products. He wants to develop the business, that is to manufacture more windows and doors. He is requesting a loan of 5,000 Somoni to buy wood. \r\n\r\nHe is a repeat customer and has a good credit history. He promises to repay his loan on time. This loan will help him to get more income and to improve living conditions and thus bring peace and joy to his family.

The six women of this trust bank are involved in various businesses such as the sale of clothes, perfumes and poultry. Another member operates a bakery. As is the custom in several countries around the world, including Guatemala, many micro entrepreneurs take advantage of the holiday season at the end of the year to earn more for their business. Such is the case of Rebecca, a 38-year-old married woman who is a tailor.\r\n\r\nShe is the mother of three children, who currently attend kindergarten and 5th grade. Both Rebecca and her husband are business partners, and they work together. Neither of them completed primary school. They work hard to support their children\u2019s education so that they can excel and perhaps attend college one day. \r\n\r\nAs the year-end holidays have arrived as well as the anticipated beginning of the new school year, Rebecca is quite busy. As there will be an increased demand for school uniforms, Rebecca has applied for a loan with Friendship Bridge so she can buy various kinds of fabrics and other materials necessary to sew clothing.\r\n\r\nThis is Rebecca's 4th loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. She states that she really likes the organization because it not only supports her financially with capital but also because of the monthly training she receives on various subjects such as, women's health, children's rights, business management, among others. She believes that all these topics enrich women\u2019s lives and help them to understand how to live a better life.\r\n\r\nRebecca appreciates the support that her business is receiving through the KIVA investors. She wishes a Merry Christmas to all and a very happy and\r\nblessed 2013.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":1254345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy fabrics.

It is a priority to save as much as they can so that they are able to send their children to school in January!\r\n\r\nIngrid Yolanda, a 25 year old woman, has followed her mother into Friendship Bridge. Her hard working and dedicated mother has set a great example for her daughter. She has achieved many of her goals and Ingrid has witnessed this! She is motivated by her children who give her inspiration and strength and she states that they are her primary focus. Ingrid and her husband live in the rural community of Xepatan, Patzun, and Chimaltenango, Guatemala. They have worked in agriculture for several years. However, last year she decided to make a change in her business life and opened a small storefront. By doing this, she could realize a faster turnaround in her financial capital. Ingrid is very pleased and inspired with the result that this loan has brought to her life.\r\n\r\nIngrid shares that her business is doing well. For the holiday season, she has decided to include the sale of fireworks as well as seasonal produce like grapes, apples, and pears. For this reason, Ingrid sought her first loan with Friendship Bridge. It will be invested to increase her shop inventory, and to buy the seasonal product, mentioned above. With her business profit, she will be able to send her oldest daughter to school in January!

She is the mother of a 7 year old boy and lives with 28 year old Julio, who is the father of her son. With her family, she lives in the house that they built with the economic support of relatives. Here the couple shares the happiness of living together and working continuously to have a better quality of life. Mar\u00eda makes a living selling shoes and sandals, every two weeks or once a month, depending on the demand. To get her merchandise she travels to another city on bus for more than 20 hours. From there she makes the same trip back with the large amount of items to sell among relatives, friends and others. \r\n\r\nThe styles that she brings back are in style, exclusive and high quality. For this reason, she is able to sell them all in little time. She makes her sales on foot, traveling through the main streets of the city in search of customers that would like to buy something that she has with her. Sometimes customers make orders in advance. Since she began the business it has gone very well for her thanks to her charisma and the quality of all the items that she sells. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is making sales and is very happy when she runs out of her merchandise. She has been doing this work for nine years and says that the most difficult part is transporting the shoes because the boxes are very heavy and the strain needed to do it agitates her. However, she continues moving forward and in the near future she hopes to have a store where she can sell all types of apparel and footwear and continue working in what she considers is her passion. \r\n\r\nThis is her eleventh loan with MFP and is thankful to those who make her previous loan possible so that she can continue with her objectives.

She has been separated from her partner who she had been with for many years and with whom she has four children who are all older and independent. She lives with 37 year old Diana in her own house that she was able to buy with hard work and many years of saving. \r\n\r\nOur friend Mis\u00e9lida is a multifaceted woman with a business vision. She has widely developed various businesses according to the season. Among these activities what she focuses primarily on is selling drinks of all types, sizes and brands. She makes wholesale orders to sell among her neighbors and the occasional customers that pass by her house. To run her business she has a space in her home where she has set up several chairs and tables near the freezer. She has had this work for five years. She now also buys and sells grains including corn, beans and kudzu. On special occasions she sells dress apparel for all ages and sells regional foods. She works in all these activities with full responsibility and under a determined schedule. \r\n\r\nFor the business' future she hopes to have a well stocked bar where she would be able to sell all day more peacefully. She currently only sells her drinks during the afternoons. Although she already has experience in this work she feels that she still has difficulty attending to all her customers. However, she hopes that all the effort she puts in, it will produce good results. Until now, the only thing that she hopes for is to continue moving forward. \r\n\r\nThis is her eleventh loan with MFP and is very happy to know that she has financial support since it makes her feel more certain that she will advance with her work. She is committed once again to make her payments on time like she has done with the previous loans that she has had. She is very happy to belong to a communal bank because all of the members are very responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (3000 soles) she will buy more drinks to have for her business and thus be able to satisfy all of her customers' orders and have different types and brands of drinks.

Since she started the business she\u2019s been working alone; she started five years ago and has seen that it\u2019s very profitable because it generates good income that helps her cover her personal and family expenses.  She also sometimes sells shoes and various other articles like toys and children\u2019s accessories.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her activity is that it leaves time for her to dedicate to her studies and to do household chores when necessary.  Sometimes she\u2019s felt that not knowing how to collect her payments due has been a difficulty but she\u2019s gradually been winning over the respect and trust of her customers who now pay her as scheduled and sometimes even ahead of time.

They have four children; one of which is still an 11-year-old minor attending school and still dependent on what Zoila and Jorge can offer as parents.  They both share their days and the joy of raising their children together.  She lives in her own house that she acquired after much effort and the entire family puts much effort into continuing to move forward.\r\n\r\nZoila has a business selling food; she prepares delicious regional dishes.  Customers are drawn to her stand by the unique aroma and delicious flavor of her home-cooked meals.  She sells on the sidewalk by her house located in an area with a large number of passersby of all types of people.  Although she only works at night, she\u2019s seen that it generates good income.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for about 41 years because even as a little girl she helped her mother in the kitchen to prepare meals; she was also a street food vendor.  This business has provided her with the necessary money to feed her daughters and pay for their schooling but she feels that her expenses will rise later on and she will need money.  This is why she wants to open a restaurant at home so she can sell her delicious dishes more comfortably every day; she continues to seek a way to consolidate her income.\r\n\r\nZoila enjoys her work very much, more so now when she sees that her diners leave her house happy.  She enjoys chatting with her customer while they enjoy their meals.  Sometimes it\u2019s very difficult for her to take care of everyone who comes by her stand but despite this she does not falter in her drive to get ahead and is willing to continue working to reach her main wish.  She knows that success is reached little by little as long as one continues striving toward it.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #7 and she\u2019s grateful for the opportunity and the trust placed in her by granting this loan.  She commits to make her payments punctually and she enjoys being part of the communal bank she belongs to because she notes that the members are all responsible, supportive people.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,500 soles to buy ingredients and some supplies she needs to continue preparing her dishes and will also invest in building materials to set up a small space to tend to her customers.  On the other hand, she will also set aside a certain amount to buy mototaxi spare parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1261234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food-preparation ingredients and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-20T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-19T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":377.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":397.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":396.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":427.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":443.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":457.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.58},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150.86,"local_amount":377.15,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":386.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189108,"comment":null},{"amount":159.2,"local_amount":397.99,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":408.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573084,"comment":null},{"amount":158.58,"local_amount":396.45,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":406.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122726,"comment":null},{"amount":171.04,"local_amount":427.62,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":438.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868552,"comment":null},{"amount":177.43,"local_amount":443.57,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":454.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577383,"comment":null},{"amount":182.89,"local_amount":457.22,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":468.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529620,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-25T03:27:11Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509858,"name":"Merlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Merlyn, 32, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite Philippines.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Because the dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those listed in the catalogue, the dealer is able to make a profit on the items. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 24,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMyra dreams to expand her business and hopes that her family will have good health. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

After her training, she opened a small sewing shop which has been operating for 2 years. She also does embroidery, but she doesn\u2019t have all the material she needs to keep up with her orders and be able to satisfy her clientele in time. This is why she is seeking a loan to buy fabric and small sewing supplies (pins, needles, lining, thread,\u2026) which will prevent her from needing to go to the market all the time and instead be able to sew and sell to her customers. The profits that come from this loan will allow her not only to buy her little sewing supplies to grow her business, but also to satisfy some of her needs as well as those of her small

She is separated from her common-law husband of many years.  Currently she lives in her own house that she built next to her ex-partner.  Three of their four children live with her, and day after day they fight together to create a better life for themselves.\r\n\r\nShe is a woman who has always worked to get ahead.  She is involved in various activities to generate income, such as washing clothes, selling used clothes and selling soft drinks on the weekends.  However, her most important activity is focused on food sales.  She rents a space within a government building and offers various dishes that are well-received by her customers.\r\n\r\nShe makes the most delicious Peruvian dishes, such as \u201carroz con pollo\u201d (chicken with rice),  \u201cpapa a la huanca\u00edna\" (potatoes with a special sauce) \u201clomo saltado\u201d (salted beef loin),  \u201caj\u00ed de gallina\u201d (hen with chili peppers) and others.  These are always served with delicious drinks such as  \u201cchicha morada\u201d (a rice and fruit-based drink)  or \u201caguajina\u201d, which is made from palm tree fruit.  She has been doing this work for five years and has help from her children.\r\n\r\nWhat Roc\u00edo likes most about her work is that she is able to set her own schedule so that she can manage her time and dedicate it to various activities.  Her business is progressing because she likes what she does, and she hopes that in time she will be able to have a modest restaurant in which she can provide greater comfort to her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is thankful for the opportunity and faith that the institution has put in her.  She promises to comply with her loan repayment schedule.  She is also glad to be part of her communal bank, since the members are responsible and supportive.  The funds she is seeking (1800 <em>nuevos soles<\/em>) will be invested in various ingredients that she needs in order to make the food that she sells.

is Floripe. She previously accessed a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase merchandise items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and for their personal, household, and business expenses. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics needed in her business. The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. More items to sell will result in more profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her children\u2019s education and daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nFloripe dreams of expanding her business and helping her children finish their studies through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week.

He is single and lives in his own home with his two children, who are 20 and 19 years old.  His mother also lives with them.  Getulio loves each member of his family very much and he works hard everyday to improve their quality of life.  Getulio's business is street sales of sweets and fried bananas, known as \"chifles.\"  He also rents his \"mototaxi\" (a motor bike taxi used for transportation services), which generates some additional income.  He principally makes the sweets and fried bananas in his house, with the help of his children.  To make them, he stocks up on raw materials, such as \"bellaco,\" or green, bananas.  He cuts them up one at a time and then fries them.  Finally, he bags them up and heads out the to city streets to sell them.  Each bag of \"chilfes\" is sold with onion sauce.  Getulio decided to start this business more than two years ago.  During that time, his business has grown, and he has made a name for himself with the high quality and delicious taste of his products.  Getulio feels that his business is profitable because it's easy to carry out and because he earns a good living.  In addition, he likes to relate to people and to strike up friendships with his regular customers.  Getulio earns a profit every day, which he invests again to earn more money.  He hopes to grow his business and produce a greater volume so he can sell wholesale to the small groceries in the settlements.  This is Getulio's third loan with MFP.  As such, he is grateful to all the people who make his financing possible and allow him to continue working toward his goals and planned growth.  In addition, he is certain that he will once again punctually repay his loan, just like he has with his previous loans.  Getulio is very thankful to be a client of MFP, as they offer him all the help he needs to keep moving forward. \r\nWith the requested sum of 2000 nuevos soles (USD $800), Getulio will invest in the purchase of supplies, like banana bunches, cooking oil, bags, onions, lemons and other ingredients for making \"chifles.\"  He will also purchase a load of firewood to be used in the stove where he fries the bananas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1261317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase banana bunches, cooking oil, bags, onions, lemons and other ingredients.

The need to be independent and the daily household expenses that she had to cover were the main motivations that led her to develop her business. She has run her stand for almost four years. In the beginning, she felt very intimidated by starting a business, but with time she was able to develop her skills; now she sells a lot and is happy about that.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is chatting with her customers and making them laugh. She thinks the hardest part is having to sell out in the strong morning sun.

It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s a farmer\u2019s life,\u201d says Felipe. \n\nBeside cacao, Felipe also receives income from corn sold at the Punta Gorda market, one hour down the road from San Jose, as well as beans and yams sold locally. He has used this money to invest in one of few solar panels in the village of San Jose, Toledo District, which is not connected to the grid due to poor road access. The solar panel is hooked to a battery and an inverter to provide electricity for stable phone use and light. What helped Felipe beat his peers in installing electricity in the home? \u201cI never neglect anything,\u201d he says, and lives by it. \n\nFelipe will use the loan to invest in cleaning his cacao plots. Cleaning means cutting the underbrush to clear access to the trees for pruning and harvesting and is fundamental in preventing spread of mold in the rainy season. Cacao farms located in lowland tropical forest require cleaning every 3-4 months. \n\nAn entrepreneur at heart, Felipe is all about diversifying his crops and is one of few farmers to grow fresh vegetables \u2013 cabbage, tomato and peppers among others on his farm.

Rafael's first loan will go towards cleaning, which for cacao farmers means removing the underbrush in order to plant new seedlings, prepare for pruning or harvesting by opening pathways and access to the trees. \n\nRafael recently expanded the scope of his cacao farm by transplanting \u2013 moving seedlings from bags into the ground \u2013 300 trees. Planting new seedlings is a long-term investment, as cacao trees take 3-5 years to start producing pods. \n\nInvestment in the farm facilitated by loans translates to investment in his children, 5 of whom are currently enrolled in school. Besides taking the kids away from helping around the farm, school in Belize has annual tuition costs that are prohibitive for many Maya farmers in Toledo. Rafel's older kids followed his example by taking up cacao farming themselves. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":252.1,"image":{"id":1260158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To hire help with cleaning his farm of almost 1,000 cacao trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2012-12-20T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-19T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347117824,"comment":null},{"amount":26.26,"local_amount":47.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863435,"comment":null},{"amount":26.38,"local_amount":47.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098923,"comment":null},{"amount":26.39,"local_amount":47.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971138,"comment":null},{"amount":26.79,"local_amount":48.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":53.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751663,"comment":null},{"amount":26.78,"local_amount":48.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":53.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993404,"comment":null},{"amount":26.92,"local_amount":48.94,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":53.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255573,"comment":null},{"amount":23.04,"local_amount":41.9,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":45.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136414,"comment":null},{"amount":23.04,"local_amount":41.9,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":45.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900631,"comment":null},{"amount":20.34,"local_amount":36.99,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":40.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088516,"comment":null},{"amount":0.04,"local_amount":0.04,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":0.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202020,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-20T23:31:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":510499,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juan is a cacao farmer in San Jose.

53, and his wife Margarita live in the village of Indian Creek, close to the highway connecting southern Belize to the ex capital of Belize City. Road infrastructure means connection to the electric grid, but also higher expenses due to power bills.\n\nSantiago, a father of six, lives with his wife and their youngest, a 17-year-old son. Having initially tried to manage a teaching job alongside farming, he opted to join the ranks of many farmers making their land their full-time job and are looking sustain their families by tapping into new markets for cash crops. To diversify his income stream, Santiago has kept his eyes and ears open about different market opportunities, this has led him to expand to pumpkin, a high-demand crop on the neighboring Guatemala market. Moreover, there is pre-harvest financing for pumpkin, whereas until now there were virtually no financing mechanisms in place for cacao farmers. Santiago has been investing his income in home improvement and diversifying his food supply, such as his recently installed small-scale tilapia ponds.\n\nCacao farming has proved to be risky business for Santiago, whose crop was devastated by Hurricane Iris in 2001, and again in 2007 by a fire that spread from a neighboring farm. Persistent in his efforts, however, he replanted every time, and even transplanted 500 new seedlings in September of 2012 to expand his cacao farm, which has 30-year-old trees. Cacao trees take three to five years to begin producing pods and continue at full capacity for 60-70 years. Farmers have to routinely clean and prune their cacao trees to ease access for harvesting, prevent spread of mold infestation and increase yields in the coming harvest season.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":481.45,"image":{"id":1260185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Add to that some 13 grandchildren and spouses of the 10 live-in kids and you can picture this famous family from San Pedro Columbia. \n\nMost westerners have a hard time even imagining anything past a couple of children, but Eladio and Virginia have embraced each without fail and have worked out parenting to an art. Visitors from around the world have been visiting this beautiful family and their farm since they started a sustainable tourism enterprise. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky to meet my brothers and sisters around the world just through a little garden,\u201d Eladio says enthusiastically. Most of the family is trilingual, as Eladio comes from a Mopan Maya speaking environment and Virginia's background is Q'eqchi', and everybody also speaks English on top of the two Maya tongues. \n\nBeside cacao, they grow more exotic crops like mango, coconut, ginger, lemongrass and Jamaican lime. \u201cI grow whatever the birds or the agouti [type of rodent]bring. That\u2019s how an agouti works. I keep stashing the seeds also,\u201d Eladio assures us with a huge smile. The 31-acre farm has been key in sustaining the numerous family and also served as a source of learning for the family and now visitors from abroad. Eladio and Virginia\u2019s farm is a prime example of integrated farming, where timber and fruit trees abound in harmony and soil is enriched by composting underbrush cleared for pathways to access the crop. Integrated farming brings opportunities for soil enrichment, but also means more work cleaning, pruning and raking the underbrush to transform it to compost. Regular cleaning is indispensable for cacao farms on tropical lowlands as good soil, rain and shade make for prime conditions for growth. \u201cEverybody wants to be a student these days. I want my kids to be farmers,\u201d says Eladio.

She works hard to manage her variety store and continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\n\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store where groceries, toiletries, and beverages are sold in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP of cooking oil, or an egg. Liza buys her supplies at wholesale prices and sells by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\n\nNorberta is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to help continue to operate her business and expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income with her loan.\n\nShe hopes that her children will have a good life and she dreams of expanding her business. She faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She lives with her current partner and her three children comfortably in her own house that she built with her ex-spouse.  \r\n\r\nCarmen\u2019s activity is sewing, an occupation she learned at an occupational education center.  She plans to buy two sewing machines to start the business she set up at home where she tends to customers who seek her out because of the good quality of her work; this is how she wins them over.  Then they recommend her to other people who become her regular customers.  She currently has three sewing machines that she bought with her profits and with prior MFP loans.  She\u2019s been in this business for more than four years and to date has been doing it along.  She considers her business to be quite profitable because of the good profits it yields.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because she can do what she enjoys, sewing, and it has served to cover her household expenses and to pay for her children\u2019s schooling who are her greatest motivation to continue striving forward.  She comments though that the physical exhaustion does cause her some concern because she must remain seated in the same position and this causes her back pain but she does not become discouraged and continues working and striving.\r\n\r\nShe therefore has plans to expand the business and install a small sewing workshop to make clothing at home.  This will be MFP loan #6 and she feels grateful for the financial support she\u2019s been getting and wants to continue with it so she commits to make her payments like she\u2019s done previously.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1,200 new soles to buy sewing supplies like fabric and thread to make lingerie; she will seek out the lowest prices for volume purchases so her profits will be higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1261380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

She lives with Rony who is a merchant and father of their six children who she loves very much and are her motivating force.  She lives with her spouse and children in her house that she and her spouse built.  Celia\u2019s activity is selling varied merchandise like clothes, shoes, sandals, notions and others.  She buys all her merchandise in local shopping centers and sells them in settlements along river banks making periodic trips to that zone to kindly offer and sell to her customers.  The business has been in operation five years having started it with capital of her own and then growing with MFP loans and with her spouse\u2019s help with the sales.  She considers it to be quite profitable because of the good profits it yields and because she manages to sell out everything she takes to the settlements.\r\n\r\nShe likes her activity because it keeps her busy and allows her to visit her mother who lives in the settlement she visits.  Thanks to it she generates income to cover her own expenses and her children\u2019s schooling who she loves very much.  She comments though that this business is quite physically demanding and does not leave her enough time to spend with her children.  Because of this, she\u2019s planning to leave this business and go into a new one but something she can do from the comfort of home like a grocery store.  \r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #9.  She feels grateful for the financial support she\u2019s been getting to advance with her business and because of that she commits to be responsible with her installment payments like she\u2019s been previously.  Also, she feels comfortable in her communal bank because the members are responsible people.  She will use the requested 1,000 new soles to buy varied merchandise like flashlights, batteries, clothes and beauty products to take to the settlements seeking out the lowest prices for cash purchases in order to have stock available for sale.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1261399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

He has used some of the money from the harvest sales to rent a stall where he stocks his goods when he brings them to the city to sell.\n\nJuliana, another member of the group, is a 34-year-old single mother who is hardworking and creative. She was divorced by her husband who left her for another woman. Juliana then resorted to selling charcoal to get some money to look after her children and dependents. She now wants a loan to buy wood, which she will sell in order to get school fees for her five children (a sixth child will start school next year). Juliana is challenged by stiff competition, weather changes and the tough economic times, especially now when she is the sole breadwinner for a large family. Her dream is to build a house that she and the children will call theirs.\nThe 10th person in the picture seated at the extreme right is the UGAFODE staff.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDolores dreams to give her children a good and quality education as well as hopes to expand her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

is Ester, 46, and a resident of Payatas, Philippines. She is married to Aldrin, a driver and she is mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEster operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm sized ones, to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers make up every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEster hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to expand her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1260528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses and her children\u2019s studies. \r\n\r\nSunshine operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy candy and toy products from wholesalers. She repacks them and sells them with a little profit. Her products are assorted candies, toys and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of candies and toy products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSunshine dreams to give her children a good and quality education as well as hopes to get a good and permanent stall for her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance
