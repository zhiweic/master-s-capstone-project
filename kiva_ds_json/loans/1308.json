She is an energetic entrepreneur, 38 years old, and a married mother of four children, all students. This client is a vendor of lumber. She stocks her merchandise at a suburban warehouse. She started her business with assistance from her older brother. Later on, she benefited from a loan from the microfinance institution Hekima. She has been in this business for eighteen years. \r\n\r\nThis new loan is going to be used to purchase 200 boards. Thus, she would like to expand her plans, buy a parcel of land, build a house, and provide education, food, and clothing for her children. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, she thanks Hekima very much for promoting autonomy for unbanked women entrepreneurs, especially during this critical time of post-conflict in the country's east.

dreams of becoming a science teacher, but without a teaching degree knows it may never be possible. Rolando was accepted into the Universidad San Francisco De As\u00eds, and now with the chance to achieve his dream, is concerned about affording tuition fees. \r\n\r\nHe expects to graduate in December 2014, but without a loan, is unsure how he will be able to continue to afford his education. He shares that his alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until he could return. For Rolando, it is important to him to graduate on time so he can enter into the job market as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nWith a loan, Rolando plans on using the funds to pay his tuition while he saves his salary from his part-time job. Rolando currently works 30 hours a week, but making time to work and go to school has been one of his biggest challenges. \r\n\r\nFor his family of three, finances have always been tight. This loan will allow him to afford his education and focus on his schoolwork.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1494590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for tuition fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":264,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T18:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T18:20:07Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rolando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1749,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":218.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":72.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-01T18:32:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":648391,"name":"Hashi Mohamoud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hashi Mohamoud is 25 years old.

All children are too young to attend school.  Altynay has a secondary education. To provide income for her family, Altynay has worked in farming and raising livestock.  She started six years ago, with the purchase of cattle for 25,000 KGS. Altynay and her husband have been living in a shed for six years. Through her hard work, Altynay's household now has 3 dairy cows, 2 heifers, 1 horse, and 2 bulls.  At the same time, she has cultivated 2.8 hectares of land, where she grows beans and perennial grasses. Altynay milks the cows and sells the milk for cash.

All of her children are in school.  Zarima has a secondary education. She travels through life optimistically, knows exactly what she wants and achieves it all through her own efforts. Zarima knows how to properly use and plan funds to achieve her goals. Zarima is the main income source for her family.  She has engaged in livestock raising and farming, starting 15 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS. Through her hard work, Zarima's household now has 7 dairy cows, 3 heifers, 5 steers, and a small plot where she grows beans and perennial grasses. She has all the necessary conditions to raise cattle: a barn for keeping cattle, and distant pastures. She procures all the necessary hay and fodder. Her spouse works in transporting passengers. Their monthly gross income is 11,000 som (KGS). In order to further grow her business, Zarima has appealed to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy a cow for cattle breeding. Zarima plans to invest the loan income into increasing the amount of domestic animals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1495172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

After all, the creation of a family is a holy and responsible step. Bobur does not want to become a burden to his parents. Thus, Bobur works hard day and night. He unloads goods at a train station, which is located in the Spitamen region.  Babur has his own team of workers.  They all work very amicably.\r\nAt the same time, Bobur is also engaged in raising livestock. He raises sheep and goats at home. Bobur has recently started his business, but seeing that this occupation is profitable, he has decided to increase the number of livestock, especially because he has a place where he can raise cattle without difficulty. After learning about MDO \"Arvand\", Bobur has turned to the organization for funds. Bobur plans to use this loan to purchase cattle. He hopes for the support of the organization, and expresses his gratitude in advance!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1491095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T19:00:09Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bobur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":69.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":71.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":76.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":78.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":81.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":84.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":90.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":96.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":97.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.07},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T02:17:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":648413,"name":"Sajida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sajida is a 40-year-old married woman and the mother of three sons.

The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.\r\n\r\nThe loan is very important for Shushanik and her husband, and they hope for lenders' support.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1514488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for products to resell (fruits and vegetables) and to renovate the truck for transporting the products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2014-01-20T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shushanik","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":86.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":93.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":95.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":94.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":95.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":97.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":101.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":100.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":104.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":104.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":106.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":108.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":108.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":112.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":112.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":113.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":115.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":116.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":118.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":119.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.69},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.29},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.32},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":659417,"name":"Walid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Walid is 20 years old.

The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who do not have access to credit products before because they have no credit history. \r\n\r\nHayk will be very grateful to his lenders for support and the loan is really important for his business.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1514493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for new stock of shoes to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Yerevan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2014-01-20T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hayk","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":107},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":112},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":113},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":122},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":121},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":126},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":129},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":131},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":136},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":137},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":141},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":155}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":659411,"name":"Dabash Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Dabash and consists of 4 members.

Nodar is an experienced driver and has the appropriate driving license. \r\n\r\nHe hopes he will earn a good income and improve the standard of living for his family members in the near future."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1495160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy a minibus and start working on a line ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Bakhvi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T21:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T21:00:12Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nodar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.14},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":648468,"name":"Khalida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalida, 43 years old, is a hardworking and independent woman.

Every day, after school, he went to his grandfather and helped him until late in the summer evening. When he grew up, after finishing secondary school, he started at the agricultural university. He got married and lives with his parents. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Khurshed studies by distance, and in parallel he works with his childhood activities and dream. In the autumn he gathered all his harvest and sold it. For the money earned, he rented new land and would like to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizers. However, he does not currently have enough money. Therefore he turned to Arvand for material support. For the money he receives, he expands his business and this way improves life for himself and his family. He is very thankful to the employees of Arvand for the financial support.

He is married and has three children who depend on him. Since his young years, Ochilboy worked with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding. He helped his father raise cattle. Later, when he got married, he started working as a taxi driver, but this type of business did not bring in a lot of income. He decided to continue his father's trade. \r\n\r\nWith help from his large family, he sows potatoes and receives an income for everyday family expenses. However, this is not a lot for such a large family. For their future, Ochilboy needs to save money and have a stable source of income through livestock breeding. Therefore, he currently wants to purchase several heads of cattle and raise them and expand his business. Through working this way, he would like to earn money for his family and raise his children worthily and support them with all necessary means. To do this, Ochilboy turned to Arvand and would like to receive a loan to purchase livestock. He hopes for extra income and thanks Arvand in advance.

Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nJohn is married and has thirteen children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for thirteen years now and they are currently growing maize, cassava, sunflower and watermelon on their farm. His wife runs a small business.

He is 34. He is the head of a family, a loving husband, and a responsible father. Oyatullo is a father of two. He has a nine year old girl and a boy of seven. He loves his family. Oyatullo lives with his family in Dushanbe. Dushanbe is the capital of the Republic of Tajikistan. The city is unique and beautiful in its own way. Oyatullo loves his city, and he likes to drive through the streets of his hometown. \r\n\r\nA few years ago, Oyatullo worked as a taxi driver. He drove his customers from one point to another in the city. Because of his circumstances, he had to sell his car, and so he no longer works as a taxi driver. Now he has the option of taking out a loan so that he can once again do his favorite work. Oyatullo plans to save money and take out a loan to buy a car.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1512296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"buy

This higher priced product would bring more money to the farmers, and it would allow Jean Bosco to expand his business and hire additional employees in processing and distribution.\n\nCurrently Jean Bosco's rice processing business has the capacity to process twice as much rice.

Despite its proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practised in the region, many individuals have expressed an interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nBenard is married and has three children. He and his wife are farmers. His wife is a housewife. They have been farming for five years and are currently growing bananas, papaya, vegetables, maize and blue gum trees on their farm. Benard is looking forward to beekeeping, as he loves honey, and this is an opportunity for him to generate extra income.\r\n\r\nThis is Benard\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. He is interested in working with Honey Care because the organization is offering him a loan that he can afford and because of its good relations with farmers.

His hope for the future is to generate enough income to educate his children and improve his family\u2019s lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1484497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Sindo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T22:55:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":659488,"name":"Jefferson Joel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jefferson tiene 19 a\u00f1os de edad estado civil soltero, vive con sus padres, en el cant\u00f3n Ventanas Provincia de los R\u00edos.\n\nEs integrante de la VRC SAN FRANCISCO, se encuentra ubicada en el Recinto Pantano, pertenece al Cant\u00f3n Ventanas se dedican a labores Agr\u00edcolas y Pecuarias.\n\nJefferson se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz.

Nasiba's husband is a driver who works along a city line from early morning until the evening.  Nasiba also works to make a living.  She is a skilled craftswoman who has been involved in sewing for the past six years.  She takes orders at home and mostly sews different styles of women's traditional dresses.
