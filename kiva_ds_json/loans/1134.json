In this way Juan will give his family peace, and he will be able to work more calmly and continue fighting in order to make his biggest dream a reality: to give his children an education and to be able to have a transportation business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":194.99,"image":{"id":1362544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to cover travel costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.19},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.82,"local_amount":58.19,"processed_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":58.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664569,"comment":null},{"amount":26.29,"local_amount":70.09,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776176,"comment":null},{"amount":54.92,"local_amount":146.45,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":147.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779278,"comment":null},{"amount":29.56,"local_amount":78.83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:01Z","rounded_local_amount":79.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819370,"comment":null},{"amount":30.42,"local_amount":81.12,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":81.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472323,"comment":null},{"amount":31.98,"local_amount":85.28,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":85.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694819,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-11T22:00:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":567096,"name":"Jamila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamila is married and has been blessed with four children.

is a 24-year-old business woman from Liberia. She is single and has two children, ages 5 and 3. They are currently attending school and live at home. She had completed grade twelve before starting her business. She describes herself as a hardworking woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, which is located by the sea and is the capital city of Grand Bassa County. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish. Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia. \r\n\r\nAngeline has had a table business which sells cosmetics, such as body perfume, body cream, roll-on, etc., for the past three years. She works from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. each day at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is less income. She intends to use the loan to buy more goods. \r\n\r\nShe started her business by selling for her mother. She likes her business because it helps to support her home. She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nAngeline wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for their help.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":190.89,"image":{"id":1363116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

Most people in the city speak Bassa, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n\r\nAnnie lives with her husband and six children who are between the ages of 25 and 14. Only one of her children is in school. Annie has been selling dry and fresh fish for the past 17 years. She works from 7am to 6pm everyday.  Her greatest challenge in business is less income. She intends to use the loan to buy more fish. She started her business by selling for her mother. She likes her business because it helps to support her home. She hopes to one day to own a house. She wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advanced for their help.

She'll be able to work more peacefully and continue striving and working to make her biggest dream come true: \"To give her child a career and to be able to study in the university.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":197.55,"image":{"id":1362603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","use":"to buy medicine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gisela Marilin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":67.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":68.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":72.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":74.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":77.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":87.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":90.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":94.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":98.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.36,"local_amount":67.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":67.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664573,"comment":null},{"amount":25.87,"local_amount":68.99,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-21T08:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":69.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776184,"comment":null},{"amount":27.32,"local_amount":72.84,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":73.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779281,"comment":null},{"amount":57.04,"local_amount":152.12,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":152.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054463,"comment":null},{"amount":30.53,"local_amount":81.42,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":81.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472327,"comment":null},{"amount":31.43,"local_amount":83.81,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":84.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694823,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T03:28:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":567122,"name":"Asha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha is a hardworking person.

In particular, they own a plot of land, where potatoes are grown. They also have five milk cows and ten calves. The family milks the cows every day to produce dairy products. The harvested potatoes and dairy products are sold to local retailers. \r\n\r\nTamaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Tamaz will purchase a minibus. He wants to start trading with potatoes and dairy products. Also when his calves are grown, Tamaz will be able to produce more dairy products. As retailers are buying the products at a low cost, he wants to distribute his products to the villagers and at the local markets to sell at a good price.

is 40 years old and married with 5 children between 2 and 19 years old. She runs a fish business in in Tombo, which is in the Western Rural District in Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, she\u2019s been in this business since 1998; she sells fish at home. Her husband is out of a job, so she has to run a business to have a permanent source of income. She says that the main challenges to her business are her business's location and financing to run her business at present.

There are seven women in the group whose average age is 41 years. As each of the women has a large family, they each need to have their own businesses to contribute earnings to meet the needs of their families. Their goal is to provide the very best for their children so that they can enjoy a better life. The women realize that education is a vital key to the future of themselves and their children. \r\n\r\nThe current president and one of the youngest members of the Trust Bank is Aracely de los Angeles Petrona. She is the 28-year-old mother of three boys. Her priority is to give her boys a healthy diet and a good education. Aracely is in her final year of high school and wants to continue her education in accounting. She can see how this course of study will greatly benefit her in her business. \r\n\r\nAracely is in the textile business. She sews, weaves and sells typical skirts called \"cortes,\" which are large tubes of colorful, woven material that are wrapped around the wearer and then secured with a belt called a \"faja.\" She began the business eight years ago. Her business grew and Aracely applied for her first loan with Friendship Bridge approximately three years ago. She currently employs three local people who help her meet the requests of her clients. Her employees are excited to have a job as unemployment is quite high in Guatemala. Aracely is requesting a new loan which she will use to purchase a foot loom. The expansion of Aracely's business will not only benefit her own family but also three other families as well!\r\n\r\nIn her own words, \"I very much appreciate the opportunity to get a loan and grow my business. Currently, I deliver thirty dozen skirts each week to wholesalers. With the additional third employee who I have just hired, I can produce more skirts. Also, with the additional income, I can keep my own children in school (kindergarten and 2nd grade) and support my own education that I will complete this year.\"\r\n\r\nOn behalf of her fellow members of the Trust Bank \"Dios Nos Ayudara,\" Aracely thanks each Kiva investor who believes that a micro-loan and education can have such a far reaching impact, not only in Guatemala but throughout the world. With their businesses expanding, the women are able to see a brighter future for themselves, their families and their communities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1942.5,"image":{"id":1363376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase a foot loom.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Cruz del Quiche, El Quiche","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-05-31T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-30T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aracely De Los Angeles Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Marivel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enma Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta Avelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":21500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":2150,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2162.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701771,"comment":null},{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":2150,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2162.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564176,"comment":null},{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":2150,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2162.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813233,"comment":null},{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":2150,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2162.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089103,"comment":null},{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":2150,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2162.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855072,"comment":null},{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":2150,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2162.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503408,"comment":null},{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":2150,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2162.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728392,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-05T23:45:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":567255,"name":"Moheb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moheb is a 36-year-old married man from Nablus city.

She lives in her own home together with her family, and what she most desires is to be able to work in order to generate the resources that will enable her to enjoy her future and a peaceful old age.  Tania works as a seamstress.  She designs, creates and alters different items of clothing such as blouses, pants or shirts according to the needs of the client.  She learned this work from the time she was young because she helped her cousin in a business. Thanks to that time invested she was able to learn the necessary skills so that she herself could begin her own business.  For that reason she now has her own shop and from there she attends to the requirements of her customers who fortunately have been growing in number with the passage of time.  She has been working in this field for five years and occasionally she receives help from another woman when she has very large requests.  What she likes about this activity is that she can count on the economic income with which she can manage household expenses.  At this time she is asking for 300 Soles (Peruvian currency).  She thanks everyone who makes this loan possible so that she can meet her work goals.

To accommodate a growing business, Carlton needed to lease a building to store his construction materials and his tools. \r\n\r\nDespite his many years of experience, a steady flow of clientele, and his truck as collateral, Carlton said he had difficulty acquiring a loan to pay for his storage building. \r\n\r\n\u201cI tried five banks and they all turned me down,\u201d Carlton said. \r\n\r\nOne day while Carlton was visiting City Hall in Birmingham, he told a representative at the Office of Economic Development about his challenges. The representative referred him to Accion Texas Inc. Though Carlton was happy to learn about this opportunity, he had some apprehensions about applying for a loan again. \u201cIt gets to the point where you feel like you\u2019re going to be turned down again and you get tired of trying,\u201d he said. \r\n\r\nBut he said he was pleasantly surprised at how simple and easy it was to acquire his $5,000 loan.  \u201cIt went so smoothly, I was shocked,\u201d Carlton said. \u201cI never expected it to go through as smoothly as it did. I tell everybody it\u2019s the greatest experience and you need to go to Accion.\u201d\r\n\r\nCarlton used the funds to assist with business expenses, office equipment, a storage facility for materials and supplies, and salaries for his employees.  Carlton stressed the importance of employee retention for his company and assured a portion of the loan funds will go to salaries. The loan allowed Carlton\u2019s company to save and store needed materials instead of discarding them or risk ruining them while they were left outside.  \r\n\r\nThe company currently has a steady flow of customers and Carlton is excited about his future.  The Accion loan has allowed him to further his dream and continue to grow. He said he plans to quickly pay off his loan so he can build his credit and finance other business expansion projects. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe loan I received from Accion helped me so much,\u201d Carlton

age 54, lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, with his wife, son, and daughter in-law. The family owns a small plot of agricultural land, where they grow greens and a few vegetables for their personal use. Nugzar is currently working for a local aircraft construction company as an artisan and receives a small monthly salary.\r\n\r\nNugzar and his family would like to start a family dairy farm business. He has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up capital, but without success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n \r\nNugzar is now requesting a loan from Credo to start up the family business. He has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan funds, Nugzar will purchase a milk cow.

from Zimbabwe! This is 59-year-old Triyiphina from Bulawayo. She is single with two children, both attending school. Triyiphina runs a manufacturing business producing mainly knitwear, which includes jerseys, woolen hats and baby wear. She also does cross border trading. The business has been in operation for 10 years. She says the main challenges faced are competition and the high cost of raw materials. Triyiphina has requested a loan of $500 (USD) to buy more raw materials of wool, thread and sewing fabric to make jerseys and other winter wear. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will enable her to pay school fees for her grandchildren, who she takes care of.  In the future, Triyiphina plans to buy more state-of-the-art equipment for use in her workshop so that she can stay current with new trends in fashion changes.

His mother is a teacher in the local kindergarten, earning a small monthly salary, and his father is a retired policeman who is able to provide the family with additional income from his pension. \r\n \r\nTeimuraz has requested a loan from Credo to start up his grocery business. He has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Teimuraz will purchase grocery stocks and open his store. He is a very hard-working man and intends to fulfill all the business needs for the shop himself. This will decrease his expenses and increase his profit. \r\n\r\nPart of the profit from Teimuraz's new venture will be reinvested back into the business, in order to expand the variety of the shop's product inventory.

Zaur lives in the Batumi district with his wife, two children (7 and 12 years old) and his retired mother. Zaur requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nZaur is working at the local wood workshop as a wood artisan. His wife is working at a restaurant as a cook helper. They both earn small monthly salaries. Additional family income is Zaur\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n\r\nZaur requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Zaur will purchase equipment for wood processing and open his own wood workshop. As he is already experienced in this field and is well known among the villagers, Zaur will have a good number of clients. As Zaur will not be dependent on a small salary anymore, and will have private orders, his income will significantly increase. He will work hard and log many hours to try and expand his business.

Badri lives alone in Martvili district. Badri requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Badri owns a plot of agricultural land where nut trees are grown. He also has a vineyard and trades with firewood. Harvested products are sold at the local markets and Badri earns a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nBadri requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

prepares and sells fish to earn an income.

She cites her primary challenge as the inconsistent availability of fish from the wharf. \r\n\r\nShe is in her early forties and lives in the Tombo Western rural area of Freetown. Her husband is a fisherman and they are blessed with four children between the ages of four and 20 years old. Two of the children are still attending school. \r\n \r\nGbassary has requested a loan in order to purchase more fish to prepare and offer for sale. The extra income generated from this loan will allow her to ensure the education of her children and to make essential renovations to her house.

Elizabeth was a student, but she dropped out at an early age. She started a business to improve her standard of living.\r\n\r\nElizabeth sells general supplies, such as eggs, slippers, and waxed cotton. She has been running this business for seven years. She works at the business for 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. Elizabeth says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has requested a loan in order to purchase items such as eggs, slippers, and waxed cotton for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her capital and pay her child's school fees. In the future, she plans to further her education. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1363703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is 52 years old. She lives in a small village of Kaspi District, with her parents-in-law, who are provided with a retirement pension. Marina requested a loan from local financial institutions several times, for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMarina works as a cooker, at a local poultry factory. The job pays totally 300 Laris per month. It is hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNow, Marina has requested a loan from Credo, to start up a family business. Marina has been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products.

Mrs. Filo has to make a great effort to raise and fatten her animals because buying the feed is not easy.  However, despite all these difficulties she wants to eventually have more animals in order to continue helping her son with his studies.

Her loan request was rejected every time due to her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milking cow and a pig. Marekhi milks the cow and produces cheese products. While they sell cheese and piglets at a good price, it is hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarekhi had requested for a loan from Credo to start a family business and has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Marekhi will begin trading in clothes. She plans to purchase clothes at wholesale prices and then resell at higher prices. This will increase the income of her family.

He purchases lumber at the market of another town and makes everything himself. He has many good clients. The business is good and expanding every day.

It has 10 members led by a governing board with Soledad as its Secretary.  The communal bank members carry out a variety of businesses among which are a beauty salon, making and selling flannel clothes, macram\u00e9 blanket weaving, liquor store, stocking sales, chicken shop and catalog cosmetics sales.\r\n\r\nThe loan they\u2019ll take out will benefit small micro businesswomen like Soledad.  She indicates that she\u2019s been in Pro Mujer for two years having joined thanks to an invitation by a family member who is a member of the institution.  She currently has a business making and selling flannel clothes.  She learned this business from her sister who is in the same line of work.  With help from her mother she set up her own sales space four years ago.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019ll take out now is to increase capital.

He is single. His business consists in the sale of perfumes previously ordered by his customers. He lives with his parents in the municipality of Arjona, in the province of Bolivar, very close to the capital, Cartagena de Indias. Arjona is known for the manufacture and sale of products such as spongy bread rolls made from unripe or dry corn and dairy products such as cheese and whey. These products are sold in stores in the city and also in the streets and squares of Cartagena. Whole families participate in this trade and this legacy has been passed on from generation to generation. This has given the city a less known title, that of world capital of spongy bread rolls.\r\nLuis started his business in this environment a year and a half ago with the help of his parents. He has a loyal clientele that makes orders periodically and pays in biweekly installments. One of the purposes of the loan is to increase the working capital of the business, so it can grow and Luis can improve his profit. He wants to contribute to the household expenses and, on a personal level, become a marketing professional.\r\nHe is applying for a loan from Kiva through the field partner, Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, to purchase perfumes previously ordered by his clients.

The group is located in San Miguel Soyaltepec. They chose this name because it is the name of the street where they have their meetings. It is located a few meters from the river from the reservoir Cerro de Oro.\r\nQuirino is one of the members of the communal bank. He is married and has three children. They are all studying, but one of them is already in college. Quirino only has primary studies because studying was difficult and expensive, so he approached an acquaintance who was a carpenter and asked for a job. He learned the trade quickly and when he grew up decided to open his own furniture workshop. He has been doing this for 20 years and over the years he has earned a reputation for doing a good job. Quirino also says that thanks to his workshop he has provided for his family and has opened other smaller businesses such as a car wash business. He also bought a sound system to provide music for parties.\r\nQuirino is very happy and he says his businesses are also family businesses because in the afternoons he teaches his children the trade.\r\nHe is asking for a loan to purchase wood, glue, nails, etc., and also for maintenance for his equipment.\r\nQuirino hopes his business will continue to prosper so he can offer his children

They are above all very cheerful and always smiling. They have known each other for several years from the community where they live, which is very peaceful.\r\nThe members of the group chose the name \"princesas\" (princesses) for the communal bank because they consider themselves pretty.\r\nAgustina is the representative of the group. She is affectionately nicknamed Gutis. She is 42 years old and has been married for 11 years to Bernardo, who works as a construction worker. Together they have 3 children who are attending school.\r\nGutis has had a sewing workshop for 9 years. She opened it because she had worked in a clothing factory but decided to start her own business. She also took some courses to improve the quality of her work. She makes suits but also does fittings and alterations. Her customers make their orders in advance and Gutis works upon request on the garments and alterations previously ordered.\r\nGutis says that despite the amount of effort invested in her work, sometimes her earnings are very meager, so she also breeds and fattens pigs, as an additional source of income.\r\nIn her sewing workshop everything is going well, except for one of her sewing machines which broke down.

Ram\u00f3n is 27 and has been married to Marisol for some time now. Together they have built a family with three children, none of whom are currently in school. Ram\u00f3n has cultivated prickly pear for five years. He started this work because he wanted to improve his family's quality of life somehow. He says that he plants the prickly pear in medium-sized bushes. He takes care of them for one year. In order to sell them, Ram\u00f3n needs to fertilize them while they are growing. He also needs to water them whenever they need it, and keep them safe from snowfall; often, this can burn the plants, meaning a loss of income and investment. \r\nRam\u00f3n is requesting a loan for the purchase of fertilizer for his prickly pear plants. He says that the cultivation of these plants is going very well for him, except that he is often in need of money to keep them in good condition. He needs fertilizer, he says, in order to care for them during the December snowfall, but after that it's never impossible to get good sales during the months of March, April, and May.\r\nRam\u00f3n and Marisol sell the plants in the plazas together. His goal is to one day have large greenhouses; at the moment he only has small greenhouse spaces, which does not allow him to cultivate on a larger scale; however, having larger greenhouses means more costs.

provide our customers with quality meats and seafood at low prices.\u201d Serving his hometown of Houston and its surrounding areas, Kenneth delivers to customers Monday through Saturday until 5:00 p.m., offering T-bone steak, catfish fillet, oxtail, shrimp, beef patties, bacon, pork chops, ribeye steaks, tilapia fillets, crawfish, catfish nuggets and homemade sausage made from chicken and beef.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about Accion Texas Inc. from an Accion employee, Kenneth decided to apply for a loan to take his business and team of three to the next level. Once he was approved, Kenneth purchased more meats and a freezer to increase inventory and allow for customer growth.

He is 34 years old and has been married to his wife, \u00c1ngeles, for fourteen years.  Together, they have formed a family with four children who attend school.  Juan has a carpentry shop where he makes home furniture such as doors, staircases, wood flooring, and other items.  He jokingly commented, \u201cI can make anything, from toothpicks to Noah\u2019s Ark\u201d.  Juan says that he started his business from necessity.  Previously, he worked as a carpenter and this is how he learned, but he liked it so much that he decided to start his own business.  He says that he doesn\u2019t have difficulties except that there are days when he needs a little more money to get his material.  But thanks to the loan, he will be able to complete some orders that are pending.  \r\n\r\nThis time he is requesting a loan for a higher amount to buy more wood to make his furniture.  He says that the price of wood has gone up and this has made it difficult to purchase wood, plywood, hardware, and other supplies.  But thanks to the loan, he will be able to purchase the wood.  Carlos is very grateful because he has gone through many loan cycles with VisionFund and Kiva.  He has invested the loans in his carpentry shop, which has generated more work for him. He is very proud of this result because he has been able to hire more people to work in his shop.

This time she is requesting the loan to stock her grocery store.  She will buy milk, soft drinks, bread, eggs, sugar, and salt, etc.  The only difficulty she currently has is the great amount of competition in her community, which has greatly reduced her sales.\r\n\r\nGregoria needs a refrigerator in her store in order to start selling dairy products, yogurt, cream, cheese, and ham, etc.  This would help her to increase her profits and, this way, improve her family\u2019s quality of life.
