","en":"Patricia lives in the town of Galapa, 20 minutes from the city of Barranquilla.  She\u2019s a married woman who has three children whose ages range from 20 to 22 years.  She is a tireless worker engaged in a commercial activity through which she sells products via specialized guidebooks or catalogues.  She also buys items independently that are not included in the catalogues and as an additional source of income also sells vegetables.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this commercial activity for about 8 years and through this labor is able to help out with a large part of household expenses and she feels very happy to be able to do so.  Her monthly sales generate a good profit margin which allows her to contribute to family spending and cover her personal expenses.  Her husband has a motorcycle that he provides transportation services with and also generates income.\r\n\r\nPatricia\u2019s profit margin is in line with the type of business she operates and her stock rotates quickly.  Lately, her working capital is insufficient to meet growing customer demand and this is why she\u2019s calling upon a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy catalogue items like cologne, face masks, make-up foundation, creams, gels, eyeliner, deodorants and products she has pending orders for taking advantage of sales specials.  She will also invest in her vegetable business buying products that generate good income.  Her investment augurs success because she will apply the discounts to her sales prices thus continuing the process of increasing the number of her regular customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1022065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

She was peddling everyday to help her parents and younger ones. She then got married and her husband helped her with a small amount of funds for the business. Since then, she has developed gradually.

Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about 950,000 Sierra Leone leones (SLL) every month from this business.\r\n\r\nHazma would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. He requires a loan in order to buy mobile phones and accessories. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 250,000 SLL. In the future, Hamza plans to complete the construction of his house, to rent a house, and to educate his children. He thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1029521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy mobile phones and accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-03-13T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-12T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamza","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":504583.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815494,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":504583.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444549,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":504583.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537259,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":504583.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284726,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":504583.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338274,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":504583.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354659,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T01:13:36Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402127,"name":"Yousef","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yousef, from Gaza, works as a carpenter in his own business.

She says that she is applying for a loan for the purchase of organic fertilizers and for insecticides, since she has a number of avocado, peach, guava, and black cherry trees. She also sometimes grows manzano chile peppers, radishes, and tomatoes at her house, since she has ample land, and when it is the harvest season she says that she sells her fruits and vegetables in a central area in her community. She says that she has been in this business a little more than 5 years and that she did well when she set it up, since it gives her good earnings and thus she can give her children a better quality of life and help her husband with the household expenses. She is very happy because through the loans she has set her sights every higher, and little by little she is making her dream -- to have an orchard in good condition -- a reality. One of her goals is to buy a vehicle, which will facilitate the transport of her fruits and vegetables, since she pays freight charges to transport what she grows. \n\nThe other three members of the

making traditional clothing.  One of the members of this group is Honoria, a 66-year-old woman.  She is a hardworking and happy woman who has worked since she was little and has learned how difficult it is to have food to eat.\n\nShe works selling sweets, from the cheapest to the most expensive.  She goes to parties in her community so her fellow community members can buy sweets from her.  She tells us that she likes selling her sweets a lot because it gives her good profits.  She has worked selling sweets for ten years.\n\nShe requested the loan to buy more candy, and thread and fabric to make traditional clothing.  She very much likes to weave but what she most likes, and it is her life, is selling candy because it pleases her a lot to sell her candy in the streets of her community.\n\nThe other members of the group are Sof\u00eda, Francisca Felisa, Alba, Elo\u00edna, Sebastiana Hermila, Victoria Mar\u00eda, Emilia, Catalina, Sof\u00eda Honoria, Dominga, and Julia Luc\u00eda, who sell traditional clothing; and Gabriela, who sells groceries and traditional clothing.  They are grateful to the foundation for the support it gives to hardworking women who want to improve their lives and those of their families, and to dress themselves and their compatriots in traditional outfits with Mexican labor.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6225,"image":{"id":1018058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy sweets, and thread and fabric to make traditional clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"santa maria huazolotitlan ,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-13T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-12T20:30:05Z","loan_amount":6225,"lender_count":209,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sofia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca  Felisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eloina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sebastina  Hermila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Honoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia Honoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":6225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1245,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":16017.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044506,"comment":null},{"amount":1245,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":16017.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656697,"comment":null},{"amount":1245,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":16017.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317369,"comment":null},{"amount":1245,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":16017.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418756,"comment":null},{"amount":1245,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":16017.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568371,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:38:35Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:44:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399428,"name":"Tynisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tynisha has been operating a property management company for over two years and just transformed it into her own fully-functioning limited liability company.

The name of the group comes from the fact that its meetings used to be held in a cabin belonging to one of the members.  Consuelo has a silk screen printing workshop which she has been running for ten years.  She makes calendars, agendas, posters, and prints thesis papers, t-shirts or mugs.  She also prints party invitations, brochures, etc.  She claims the business was started by her husband who taughter her how to use the machines to make letters, drawings, embroidery designs, etc.  She rents space for her shop since she does not have room at home for the machines.  The loan she is requesting is to buy ink, paper, bags, calendars and to pay for machine maintenance.  The loan will be very helpful because she has many thesis-printing orders this time of the year and she will be able to obtain the materials she needs for this.\r\n\r\nShe is married to Ra\u00fal and their adult children live independently.  Consuelo's goal is to open a shop in her house so she does not have to pay rent which is expensive and cuts into her profit.\r\n\r\nThe other 13 members of the group are Leticia, Maria del Rosario, Florentina, Maribel, Tomasa, Blanca Estela, Maricela, Martha, Isabel, Liliana, Reynalda, Sof\u00eda, and Alejandra.  They will be investing in a grocery store, fabric for sewing crafts, seasonal fruit and vegetable sales, ingredients to make bread, costume jewelry sales, mechanical workshop tools, chicken sales, and catalogue clothing and shoe sales.

has always wanted to provide a better standard of living for her family.

She is married and the mother of 1 son who is 5 years old, for whom she wants to provide the best education possible starting at an early age. Jocelyn has, by means of her business, a very good alternate mode of generating income thanks to the fact that she can concurrently care for her son. Jocelyn learned this activity from a friend who had carried out this type of work for a long time and invited her to attend product promotional meetings. Thanks to the excellent attention Jocelyn offers, her business has seen sales increase considerably. She has been able to generate a good income and, little by little, improve her family\u2019s standard of living. With the desire to deliver a large order from a client of hers, she must purchase the necessary products from her provider. However, she currently does not have sufficient capital to do this. For this reason, she has the hope that a loan will afford her the possibility to buy the personal products so that she can fill the large order that her customer has placed.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1032255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Today it has been five years since he started making profit in this business, with allows him to support his family. He makes entertainment centers, display cases and other items from wood. He does not only sell to neighbors but also to a select clientele which he has built.       \r\n\r\nHis goal for the future is to buy a house for his family and have a commercial space for his business that has better conditions than where he is currently located. This is the first loan he has taken out through Kiva, as well as the first financial assistance he has received from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will use it to buy raw materials in large quantities like plywood and paint. His investment will be successful because by purchasing in bulk he will get discounts which will increase his profits and also because he has current customers who like his work and who highly recommend him. Aside from working persistently, he also manages an accounts receivable turnover which does not exceed 34 days and has a return on sales not less than 30.7%.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1022124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy raw materials in large quantities like plywood and paint.

Her partner and her decided to improve their financial situation by setting up a business. Her partner had become unemployed and so did not have any source of income for the family. This is how they came to sell metals, cardboard, plastics; with a little capital and a small storeroom to keep their recycled material.\r\n\r\nWith this business things started to go well for them as they invested part of their earnings back into the business. Now their micro-business grows more everyday and they need a constant working capital in order to buy materials.

SeNA is a state organization for educational development for technical and technological careers.

The loan will allow him to purchase supplies in greater volume, buying yarn for hammocks, a packet of fine yarn for bags and backpacks, and also skeins of agave fiber.  With this he will be able to make ten hammocks and fifty bags, and use the rest for the backpacks.\r\n\r\nThe success of this investment lies in the fact that he will not need to purchase products as other suppliers do, which normally happens due to growing sales, but he will have a supply of stock to offer for sale.

Her husband works as a cabinetmaker. \r\n \r\nIn order to earn her own income, and help her husband with the household expenses, she sells clothing of all kinds. She sells door to door, and sells the most on the weekends. Those are the days she goes out on her rounds. She also sells in her home where she has a small shop. \r\n\r\nShe extends credit to her clients, and collects every two weeks. She goes to Guayaquil every two weeks to buy her merchandise; or every month, depending on her needs.

Her husband, Aliman, also runs the same business on the ship. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve her business, Salma needs additional money. She received capital assistance from TLM through a group lending program some years ago. And she said that the loan was very useful for her business. She then decided to apply for a larger loan amount from TLM of IDR 12,000,000. Salma wants to spend the loan to purchase many more things for her business, e.g., Balinese sarongs, fruit and traditional shawls.

baby boy. \r\n\r\nHendrik is a driver and the income he produces from being a driver is regularly insufficient to support his family needs. To overcome his financial problems Hendrik initiated a new business. He set up a kiosk and equipped it with basic commodities such as rice, sugar, cooking oil, snacks, cosmetics, etc.\r\n\r\nNow, his business is growing up and he desires to improve his income from that business. He then applied a loan application to TLM and requested a loan amounting to IDR 4,000,000. The loan will be used to stock more rice and buy soft drinks. He believes that the more goods he has to sell, the better income he can generate.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1032231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She runs a grocery and beverage shop.  She comments that she\u2019s had this business for the last five months.  She works full time since she works from 8am until 10pm, Monday to Sunday.  She must follow this schedule because there is no other store for 3 kilometers and customer demand is high, a situation she notes optimistically because she has no competition.  She has recently also added baking and selling bread.  She buys her merchandise in wholesale supermarkets and from snack distributors.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy an electric, refrigerated display case to store her products to increase clientele and thus her income.  Her goals are to expand her store to start her activities cycle since she now only has a temporary sales permit.  She will also buy a kneader to make bread making easier.\r\n\r\nMaribel lives with her husband and two children who are 6 years and one year and seven months old.  Her dream at a personal level is to obtain a house of her own since she currently lives in a borrowed house and lot.  \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the economic support Fondo Esperanza has granted her.

From all her proactive fronts, she is generating income, applying the sales techniques she knows how to employ in each of her businesses. For this reason, she has been gaining customers in all her ventures, and business grows ever day. Her goal of business expansion is endless, which is why she prepares herself with the training that helps her add value to her daily tasks. Her future goal is to perfect her stylist skills and to have a big beauty product business in which she will produce the goods herself.

Here she has a restaurant that generates income to support the well-being of the family.  She learned the work of preparing and managing food when she worked as an employee in the restaurant that her mother had in the public market.  That same restaurant was given to Nilda by her mother because her mom began to have health problems.  With her restaurant she has had many challenges that she has had to face, like the times when the metro stop was under construction and her sales went down.  For that reason she had to restructure and locate the business in her own home.  Currently her business is growing and each day her customer base increases.  With her earnings she supports the family expenses along with her husband who is an independent stationary contractor.  Her Kiva credit is the first financing that she has received through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, a Kiva field partner.  With the loan she will purchase tables, plastic chairs, fans, and a freezer.  This infrastructure will help her keep her customers comfortable so that they will return and become faithful clients.  Her goal is to have sufficient capital from permanent work to be able to support her business and in the future buy her own home.  While she works to achieve her dreams she runs her business 100% autonomously, with no less than 23.5% profitability, and with a rotation of bills to be paid of three days.

","en":"Duverlys is 34 years old and lives with her husband and their three children, who range in age from 10 to 12.  Her business experience began 6 years ago when she and her mother opened a store that sold groceries and other basic necessities.  However, Duverlys and her family later had to leave their home, since they were displaced and had to go to live with her sister.  She restarted her business 7 months ago, though with only a few basic staple items.  By working persistently she has managed to make some progress, but her biggest challenge is working capital, since she doesn\u2019t have enough for her growth plans.  She also needs more money so she can help her husband with the household expenses; he works farming a parcel of land and raising livestock.  That is why Duverlys has decided to take out a loan.  This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and she will use it to purchase a larger amount of groceries, supplies, and sweets.  Her business is located in front of a school, and she offers her customers items that they really need.  Duverlys\u2019s dream is to sell much more so that her business will prosper and she can get ahead with her family and provide her children with a good education and quality of
