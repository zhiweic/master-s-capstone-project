The loan will be used to buy more animals such as goats, and will help Florence to generate greater profits and expand on the business. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to start a poultry farm. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Golden, a businessman who is 48 years old. He runs a Zoona mobile money transfers shop in his hometown of Mansa. Golden started running his mobile money transfers shop three years ago. He says his business is the safest and cheapest way in which people can move their monies from one place to another. He is very pleased with his business because he has seen it grow in transaction value. He believes he has been able to stay in business because he is financially disciplined. Golden says his biggest challenge is that the phone he uses to make the transactions runs out of connectivity. This slows down the business. Golden is hopeful that once the Kiva loan comes in, he will be able to increase his working capital and make more profit so that he can purchase a new computer to make his transactions quicker. Golden says this loan will go a long way towards boosting his business. He thanks the Kiva lenders.

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is married with four children, all of whom attend school. She is not looking after any additional members of the family.\r\n\r\nMariam has been selling charcoal in the market at wholesale and retail for ten years, working seven days a week. She does not earn any additional income. She has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT-SACCO to enable her to purchase more bags of charcoal to sell. \r\n\r\nMariam's challenges include seasonality of supply and transportation.

To provide a source of income for his family, Kubanych became involved in farming and animal husbandry since 2010, having started this business with a sum of 10,000 KGS.  Thanks to Kubanych's hard work, today his business contains two dairy cows, five sheep and a horse.  The monthly profit from the business amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and dairy products.  In order to further develop his business, Kubanych requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a cow and repair a barn.  He plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing his business by buying additional heads of livestock and save for his son's wedding next

She has a secondary education and got married right after finishing school.  She is a very good person.  She has good references from her neighbors.  They love and support her.  To provide a source of income for his family, Mahabat became involved in farming and animal husbandry in 1998, having started this business with a sum of 5,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains one cow, and the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 13,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and dairy products and also from farming.  In order to further develop his business, Mahabat requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a cow and four sheep.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing his business by buying additional heads of livestock.  Taking care of the children and providing them with a good education is the primary goal for Mahabat and her husband."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1250026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

Mtvarisa is unemployed at the moment. \r\n\r\nThe source of income for the family is an agricultural business. In particular, they grow nuts on the family-owned land and sell the harvested products locally. In addition, Mtvarisa has a milk cow and produces cheese with the received milk. \r\n\r\nMtvarisa and Zviad decided to start their business because their existing income wasn't enough for the family and their living conditions are poor. Mtvarisa's loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provisions of business start-up and restartup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nMtvarisa has noticed that there is high demand for fish in the market. In response to the local market demand, she has requested credit to finance the costs of constructing a dam, which she will build in her garden. She will purchase local species of fish and raise them in a pond. Beginning in the spring season, the fish will start to spawn, then they can be intensively sold. \r\n\r\nMtvarisa expects that development of the fish farm will raise the income of the family. Part of the increase in income will be reinvested in the same business and the other part will be used for improving the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":637.73,"image":{"id":1250912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

is 37 years old. He is unmarried and lives in the Tskaltubo District with his parents. Nikoloz is a fireman and gets a small monthly salary. The source of income for the family is the retirement pensions of Nikoloz\u2019s parents. The family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. Since their income is not enough for the family's needs, Nikoloz decided to start up a new business. He went to a local credit agency to get money for this business start up, but without any success. His loan request was always rejected because of his low income and lack of experience in starting a new business. He received the loan in the framework of a start-up loan program that was initiated jointly by Credo and Kiva. This program aims at the provision of business start-up funds for the Georgian rural poor, who do not have access to regular credit products, as they live in poverty and are regarded as \u201cborrowers with a high risk.\" With the requested credit, Nikoloz will purchase chickens and raise them. After 4-5 months, he will start to sell them. The hens will be sold on the open market in a nearby town by Nikoloz. He will reinvest the profit for the further expansion of the farm. Also, part of the profit will be used for purchasing some necessary household goods to improve his living

Thanks to her hard work, Baktygul's farm business now has 50 sheep and two dairy cows, and the monthly income from selling milk, dairy products, and livestock is about 15,000 soms (KGS). With the goal of expanding her business, Baktygul has turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 20,000 soms (KGS) to purchase 4 sheep.

The majority of soft drinks in Congo are still sold in glass bottles. Customers bring their empty glass bottles to a vendor and buy full bottles. Her business strategy is to travel to her customers and pick up empty bottles and bring them full bottles. \r\n\r\nGisele has received four previous loans from HOPE Congo, Kiva's partner.

lives in the town of Kutaisi. He is 30 years old, married, and lives with his wife and 7-year-old son. Kakhi is, at the moment, unemployed. The only source of income for the family is the small income earned by Kakhi, who is involved in a frits trading business. The family lives in poverty. According to Credo estimations, they belong to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nKakhi decided to start his business as their existing income isn\u2019t enough for the family and their living conditions are poor. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of a business start-up and restartup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Kakhi will purchase a metal and plastic workshop.

He has children, but they do not live with him. He has been growing organic cocoa for thirty years, in a parcel located one hour walking from where he lives. He considers this an easy activity, without pressure from third parties.\r\n\r\nBecause he lives in a sylvan area, fruits like the ones from the cocoa tree grow optimally, which results in a good business alternative for all producers, like him. He wants to invest in grafted cocoa, and for that he needs to hire day laborers, who know the technique, in order to perform this task as quickly as possible. He also needs to buy compost.\r\n\r\nOne of his dreams, for the future, is to build his house with solid material, which will benefit his children.

It has not been easy getting established as an artisan because silver is very expensive and it's difficult to purchase. But when you set your own mind to it, you can achieve your goals. I like to work with jade because it is a sacred stone for us Maya people.  Jade used to be worn as an amulet, and those who wore the most jade pieces where considered to be the most important people in the community.

Ten years ago, the company that both he and his wife worked for closed down all operations in Mexico, leaving them both unemployed. They decided to take the plunge and move to the US with their two small children.\r\n\r\nJesus now works as an operator of shipping construction machinery. His sons are now teenagers and his daughter is 7 years old. Not wanting to be dependent on one job, Jesus started a brand new business on top of his full time job.\r\n\r\nBlue Party Rentals, named after his daughter Azul (means blue in Spanish), rents out jumpers and jukeboxes for parties. His clients are primarily from the Latino community in San Diego, because he says, \u201cthey love to sing.\u201d What Jesus likes about his startup business is the interaction with clients who are generally in the party mood, and that he can mostly run the business during the weekends. \r\n\r\nHis Kiva loan will be used to equip his new entertainment business with 3 jumpers and 3 jukeboxes and to pay for liability insurance. Blue Party Rentals started operations in December 2012.\r\n\r\nJesus dreams of growing Blue Party Rentals to make it his primary occupation.  He wants to offer a one-stop-shop for event organizers by also renting out tents, tables, chairs and other party equipment. He hopes to continue providing for his family, and maybe one day even buy a home and send his kids to college.\r\n\r\nFind Blue Party Rentals on Facebook at:

Salvadora is a hard-working, honest, and business-savvy lady, who won the loyalty of her customers thanks to the quality of her products. Building on her already existing customer base, she approached field partner INTEGRAL for a loan to invest in buying more ingredients to make her tasty products, such as bread, sausages, meat, sauce, etc. This way, she will be able to keep offering her customers, who are loyal and whose numbers are increasing, products of the highest quality, which will in turn increase her income and improve her life.

","en":"Burmakan is a 45-year-old married woman. She was born in the city of Jalal-Abad, where she continues to live with her family. She got married after completing high school and is now the mother of one child. \r\n\r\nTogether with her husband, the Burmakan began raising cattle. She has been working in animal husbandry since 1998, when she started her business with 5,000 som. By gradually developing her business and increasing her working capital, she was able to build a home. \r\n\r\nWith long-term business development in mind, Burmakan turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 som. She plans to use the loan to purchase cattle to raise and resell. In the long-term, the borrower would like to start a large cattle farm. She plans to use the profit from this loan to rebuild her home. While preparing the necessary documents and financial analysis, the borrower proved herself to be a responsible, well-organized, conscientious, enterprising person capable of properly running her farm and investing her money in the right places.

Gradually developing and increasing her working capital,  she has also increased her cattle headcount and built a house.  Eager to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use the whole amount of the loan to buy three cows that she will raise and resell.\r\n\r\nTurgunbu's future plans include the creation of a large farm to raise cattle and other small livestock.  With the profits received from this activity, she is planning to marry her son and buy a truck.\r\n\r\nDuring the period when all necessary documents were prepared for this loan and a financial analysis was performed, our borrower gave a very positive image.  She appeared as a responsible, honest, conscientious and enterprising woman who knows how to properly run her business and invest her money wisely.  The borrower owns a barn and can provide all the necessary conditions for cattle grazing and management. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1487.5,"image":{"id":1250150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy three cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jalal-Abad town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-10T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-09T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Turgunbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":30192.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862984,"comment":null},{"amount":850,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40257.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426695,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-16T10:04:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":505368,"name":"Corina Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Corina Guadalupe de cuarenta y seis a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus hijos en casa propia;  cliente posee un Chalet de golosinas, panes, bebidas entre otros en un centro escolar ubicado cerca de su hogar, ya tiene mucho tiempo de trabajo que le ha regalado  experiencia en las ventas y eso le permite obtener las mejores ganancias, ya tiene mucha clientela fija pues los estudiantes la prefieren porque comercia  productos de calidad, a precios accesibles pero sobre todo con un excelente servicio;  Corina es una mujer emprendedora con muchas ganas de salir adelante, tiene muchos sue\u00f1os que desea alcanzar y esta dispuesta trabajar duro para lograrlo, pues sabe que solo as\u00ed obtendr\u00e1 el \u00e9xito, como toda buena comerciante quiere acrecentar su negocio pero necesita de capital por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar golosinas por mayor, bebidas, panes, galletes etc. Corina Guadalupe tiene buenas referencias de pago y muy buena moral asegura que podr\u00e1 cancelar la deuda y al mismo tiempo tiene la confianza que podr\u00e1 darle a su familia una vida plena.","en":"Corina Guadalupe is 46 years old and lives with her husband and children in a home of her own.

She makes a living by selling clothes and cosmetics. She has had the business for several years; this has given her a lot of experience, which allows her to obtain better profits. The business is located in her home and is very well-known to the people in the area. She has built up a strong clientele because the people know that everything is of good quality, at reasonable prices and with an unequalled service that is always to the order and taste of the customers. Glenda is an enterprising woman. She is dedicated to her work and is very tenacious.

Having started this business 17 years ago with a sum of 1,500 som (KGS), through hard work she has been able to make it grow so that it presently brings her 12,000 som (KGS) per month. Currently, Zainura keeps 1 cow and 11 sheep. She raises sheep of the Gissar breed for subsequent sale, and also sells milk and dairy products from home. Thanks to her business profits, Zainura can pay for her family's basic needs.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Zainura has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional sheep, whose price is low this year. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business, and in the future hopes to realize her long-time dream of performing major renovations in her

Jamal works in animal husbandry, which is the main source of income for the family. She started this business many years ago with a sum of only 12,000 Kyrgyzstan Som and the purchase of 1 cow. Thanks to her persistent hard work, her farm now includes 4 dairy cows, 15 head of smaller livestock and 1 horse, and brings in monthly earnings of 15,000 Som from the sale of milk and dairy products.

Her husband died a few years back. Since then, she has been looking after her children and paying all household expenses alone by providing tailoring services in her community. She faced a very difficult time after the death of her husband.\r\n\r\nFarzana works with full dedication to provide for the family's needs. She works 8 hours a day. In spite of working full time, she takes care of all the housework and makes sure that she can fulfill all of her children's needs. All of the income which comes from her tailoring business goes to the household expenses, which means she is unable to save any amount for her children's future.\r\n\r\nHer older son owns a small gold shop but his income is insufficient; her other son is a student. One daughter is married, while the youngest helps her mother in her tailoring business.\r\n\r\nFarzana, as a member of this 3-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase fabric and a separate sewing machine for her daughter since currently she is having only one sewing machine which is used by both of them. Therfore purchasing a new sewing machine will help them to save time and stitch up more dresses in less time. This will also help them to satisfy the needs of clients more professionally and efficiently which will gradually increase their net income and savings as well. Farzana hopes that the loan will be beneficial to them.\r\n\r\nNote: In the picture Farzana holds a passbook in her hand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1251992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase fabric and a new sewing machine for her tailoring business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Rawalpindi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2012-12-10T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-09T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farzana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kiran","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marayam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1039},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4253},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":5540},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3448},{"due_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4747},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6185},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5156},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5349},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6969},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5814},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.24,"local_amount":4213,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-17T09:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4282.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331586809,"comment":null},{"amount":53.02,"local_amount":5050,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5132.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339471300,"comment":null},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":3016,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3065.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347023976,"comment":null},{"amount":49.07,"local_amount":4673,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4749.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356461253,"comment":null},{"amount":63.93,"local_amount":6089,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6188.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364472942,"comment":null},{"amount":53.29,"local_amount":5075,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5158.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372877343,"comment":null},{"amount":79.81,"local_amount":7601,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7725.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381648898,"comment":null},{"amount":73.17,"local_amount":6969,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7083.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390511061,"comment":null},{"amount":61.05,"local_amount":5814,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5909.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399759530,"comment":null},{"amount":15.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T10:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1524.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410032455,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-10T19:08:05Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T10:56:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":505466,"name":"Ronah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronah is 27 years old and lives in the town of Kabwohe in the Kabwohe region of Uganda.
