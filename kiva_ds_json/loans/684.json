is a 27 year-old woman and the mother of two school-age children from Baray district of Kompong Thom province.  San has run a small business as a seller for years. In front of her house, there are lots of mixed products that she sells to her customers such as canned foods, groceries, packaged food etc. From this business, she can earn around $2.7USD per day.

She is married and has two sons and three daughters, and her husband is a municipality employee with decent salary. Ma'aali wants to purchase necessary home appliances such as a washing machine, stove, and television, but because of her husband's decent salary, she needs to take a loan from FATEN to complete the payment for these appliances. When Ma'aali gets the loan, to be repaid on a monthly basis, she will purchase all the home appliances she needs. This will offer her and her family better life conditions. Ma'aali is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She needs to take a loan from FATEN that she will repay on a monthly basis. Her loan will positively impact her husband\u2019s work and increase his income which will enable him to provide a better standard of living for their family. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Fidaa' runs a grocery store but does not have enough money to increase the variety of items she sells.\r\n\r\nFidaa\u2019 is requesting a loan from FATEN to purchase grocery items to increase her competitiveness and profit. This will improve her family\u2019s living conditions. She will repay her loan on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

is a 50-year-old woman, and she is married with one daughter. Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. He is also a taxi driver. \n\nInshirah wants to help her husband repair and paint the taxi, but the amount of money she has isn't enough. So, she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Inshirah gets the loan, she will be able to help her husband repair and paint the taxi. This will improve the taxi's condition and enable her husband to work extra hours to increase the family's income which in turn will improve the family's living conditions. Inshirah is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed next to the taxi the family owns.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\n\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\n

The idea of the business came to her as a result of the difficult living conditions she and her family faced and the ambition of overcoming such a difficult life. Kumria sold some pieces of gold that were available to her family and borrowed from her relatives in order to make up capital when she began her business.\n\nKumria took a loan of 80,000 Yemeni Rials from Al-Amal Bank in order to purchase more stationery supplies for the new school year as well as to purchase other beauty materials in order to meet the demand of her clients in her neighborhood.\n\nIn the future, Kumria plans to expand her business by opening a new independent business in beauty supplies.

For the long-term, she is in the midst of a struggle to become a wholesaler of baby supplies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":887300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase dozens of diapers, baby jackets, knitted goods, blankets, bedsheets and clothespins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2011-10-11T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annie Berthe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":36700},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38400},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":39300},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40200},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":41100},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":41600},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43400},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":44000},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":45000},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":46100},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":46700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.24},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.87},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.97},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":152.11,"local_amount":74200,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":74837.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238641849,"comment":null},{"amount":159.29,"local_amount":77700,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-17T09:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":78367.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244891191,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":81300,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":81998.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250810381,"comment":null},{"amount":264.45,"local_amount":129000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:45:04Z","rounded_local_amount":130108.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257219021,"comment":null},{"amount":92.25,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45386.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263357053,"comment":null},{"amount":190.24,"local_amount":92800,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":93597.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270070388,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-12T07:21:18Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:00:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":342743,"name":"Asha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha is a married woman with six children, three of whom attend school and the other three are grown-up.

The couple have one child and live together in their own home which is located in Puerto Cocos community, in Pichari.\r\n\r\nMarisol is a farmer and, thanks to her work, she is able to obtain financial stability for the good of her family and offer her son a good education.  She started working as a farmer with only a small plot of land, growing cacao.  Over time, she managed to expand her plantings and she now produces a large quantity of cacao which has good market demand.  Her husband supports her in this work but when there are larger jobs to be done, she must hire laborers to help, for example when sowing and also when picking and collecting the cacao beans.  Her produce is taken to the wholesalers or to middlemen at the storage warehouses in her community.  In the future, Marisol hopes to expand her plantings and grow more products so that she can meet her buyers' demands.\r\n\r\nThis will be Marisol's first loan from MFP and she pledges to make her repayments on time.  She will use the 1,000 soles she is requesting to hire laborers to help her weed her plot of land and care for her plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":887551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-06T14:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":152.9},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":157.29},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":163.85},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":169.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":175.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":181.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.34,"local_amount":152.9,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":158.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666632,"comment":null},{"amount":58.98,"local_amount":157.29,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":163.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621781,"comment":null},{"amount":61.45,"local_amount":163.85,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":170.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835862,"comment":null},{"amount":63.37,"local_amount":169.01,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":175.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245619,"comment":null},{"amount":65.7,"local_amount":175.18,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":182.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385670,"comment":null},{"amount":68.16,"local_amount":181.77,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":188.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098728,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-07T11:25:31Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":342842,"name":"Sa\u00fal Uriel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En municipio de Managua, el se\u00f1or Sa\u00fal Uriel   se dedica   a laborar como ayudante fontanero   en una instituci\u00f3n del estado, dedic\u00e1ndose a esta labor desde hace Ocho a\u00f1os.

a 27-year-old single man is living in a modest house that belongs to his grandparents.

He has been running the business for one year. \r\n\r\nAccording to Yahya, the income generated from the business enables him to support his parents in covering their daily needs and benefits the community as well since the village is situated quite far from the town. Yahya plans to add more stock requested by the customers but he needs capital to do so. Therefore, Yahya is requesting a loan of IDR 10,000,000 from TLM. He would like to spend the loan on business stock such as rice, sugar, petrol and kerosene as well as to renovate his kiosk. Yahya is expecting that TLM will assist him by providing him with the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":887750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Foday has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy used clothing: T-shirts (two bales @ Le550,000), ladies blouses (two bales @ Le700,000), skirts (two bales @ Le650,000) and jeans jackets (one bale @ Le1,200,000). \r\n\r\nHe hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 300,000. In the future, Foday plans to open a big shop and an account for his old age. He is excited and hopes to finish his building and educate his children. Competition is keen but he usually buys good products that meet his customers' demands.   \r\n\r\nHe is assisted by his family members, and he serves 50 customers per day because of his quality stock.  He travels to Freetown to buy his business stock by public transport. He is hardworking and honest. He thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":875239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy used clothing: T-shirts (two bales @ Le550,000), ladies blouses (two bales @ Le700,000), skirts  (two bales @ Le650,000) and jeans jackets (one bale @ Le1,200,000).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-10-10T05:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Foday","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":230,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1019137.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244513943,"comment":null},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721769,"comment":null},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124676,"comment":null},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505582,"comment":null},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974693,"comment":null},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815268,"comment":null},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444334,"comment":null},{"amount":230,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1019137.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537073,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-16T03:23:21Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":342944,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia is 46 years old and lives in the Philippines.

He is married and has five school-going children who are 5, 8, 12, 18 and 18 years old. In 2005, Saidu Alie established his essential drugs and provisions business. He began his business when he completed his certificate in Mental Health Counseling. As a health worker, he thought it wise to be dealing in essential drugs since in his area there is no drugstore. Working 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan of Le 3,000,000. Saidu Alie requires a loan in order to buy Amoxicillin syrup - 1  box @ Le 500,000, Dexorange syrup - 10 bottles @ Le 100,000, mebendazole - 24 boxes @ Le 40,000, peak milk tins - 2 cartons @ Le 140,000, and cornflakes - 4 cartons @ Le 90,000. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 400,000. In the future, Saidu Alie plans to open another pharmacy and provision shop.  He is very excited and ready to battle to the top, he said. He wants his children to attain a higher learning certificate. Saidu Alie is assisted by his wife.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary.\r\n\r\nSamah has a grocery store and wants to purchase more groceries to have a better selection for sale, in order to increase her income. She doesn't have enough money to pay for this, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Samah gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase more groceries and have a variety of groceries for sale. This will enable her to compete, to sell more and to increase her income in order to have a better quality of life. Samah is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed instead in the grocery store.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a 19-year-old man. \r\n\r\nHe wants to improve his work and purchase clothes in bulk for sale in the coming winter season. \r\n\r\nThe amount of money he has isn't enough to pay, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. \r\n\r\nWhen Mohammad gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, he will be able to purchase more clothes for the coming season and prepare well so he can compete and sell more. This will enable him to increase his income and live in better conditions. \r\n\r\nMohammad is photographed in the place where he is selling clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her husband is employed with a decent salary. \r\n\r\nHiba has a tailoring workshop and wants to improve the quality of her work, so she wants to purchase a new sewing machine, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. \r\n\r\nWhen Hiba gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase a new sewing machine and improve the quality of her work. This will enable her to compete better and work extra to increase her income and provide better life conditions for the family. \r\n\r\nHiba is a conservative woman, so her husband, Sofyan, is photographed instead of her in her workshop.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her husband is a taxi driver and the income he gets is the only source of income for the family. Howieda wants to help her husband to pay for purchasing a new engine for the taxi the family owns in order to improve it, but she has not enough money to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. \r\n\r\nWhen Howieda gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to help her husband and pay to purchase new engine for the taxi. This will improve the taxi's capacity for working and enable her husband to work extra hours to increase the family income and offer to them better living conditions. Howieda is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed next to the taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a modest salary. Azeza has an educational center in the area where she lives and has a lot of customers. She wants to expand the center and purchase more chairs and tables for educational purposes. Azeza has an amount of money, but it is not sufficient, so she needs to take a loan from Kiva partner, FATEN, to complete the amount. When Azeza gets the loan, which is to be repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to expand the educational center she has by purchasing new chairs and tables to use. This will improve her work, increase her income and provide better living conditions for her family. \r\nAzeza is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead in a FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n<b>About this loan product<\/b><br>\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. \r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. He is also a fisherman and gets a low income from fishing.\r\n\r\nMuna wants to improve her family life by purchasing new home furniture such as bedroom furniture for her and for her children, living room furniture, etc., but she hasn't enough money to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Muna gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase the furniture her family needs. This will offer to Muna and her family better and healthier living conditions.\r\n\r\nMuna is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead at the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About this loan product:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending help text: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

This will increase her income and allow her to live in better living conditions. Wafaa' is photographed at the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About this loan product:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.\r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending help page:

is a 33 year-old young woman. She is married with two sons and two daughters. Amal is a religious woman, so her husband is photographed instead in a FATEN branch. Her husband is an industrial company employee with a decent salary. Amal wants to improve her family life by purchasing new home furniture such as bedroom furniture, living room furniture, etc. The amount of money she has isn't enough to pay for this purchase, so she needs to take out a loan from FATEN. When Amal gets the loan which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase new home furniture and offer her family better living conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with decent salary. Sahar has a project of raising poultry and benefits from selling its products. She wants to expand her project and purchase more poultry and more fodder to feed them, but the amount of money she has is not enough to pay for this. This is why she has requested a loan from FATEN. When Sahar gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to expand her project and purchase more poultry and fodder. This will increase her sales and increase her income, which will offer better life conditions for her and her family. Sahar is a conservative woman, so her husband Tha'er appears in the photograph instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

She is married and her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. To increase the family income, Maysaa' has a project raising sheep and selling their products. She wants to expand her project by purchasing more sheep, but the amount of money she has is not sufficient, so she needs to take a loan from Kiva partner, FATEN. When Maysaa' gets the loan, which is to be repaid on a monthly basis, she will purchase more sheep and sell more of their products to earn a better income and have better living conditions. \r\nMaysaa' is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead.\r\n\r\n<b>About this loan product<\/b><br>\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
