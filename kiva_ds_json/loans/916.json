Con la apertura de su local ella se siente m\u00e1s contenta ya que descansa y brinda una mejor atenci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n tiene sus beneficios ya que la ropa que tiene no se maltrata y puede exhibirla mejor. Norma es viuda y sus hijos son mayores de edad por lo que tener el negocio la hace sentirse \u00fatil, el pr\u00e9stamo al que esta accediendo lo utilizara para la compra de ropa  y as\u00ed surtir mejor el negocio.","en":"Norma began working as an informal salesperson in La Bah\u00eda de Guayaquil, a sector that\u2019s very well-known because everything can be found there.  Because she was informal she didn\u2019t do too well because she was exposed to robberies and she incurred losses that way.  She set a concrete goal for herself: to save money in order to open a locale from which to sell pants, blouses, underwear and stockings.  The locale is located near her house so she opens from 8am until 9pm from Monday through Saturday and from 8am until 1pm on Sundays because there\u2019s less movement then.  With the opening of her store she feels happier because she can rest and provide better service.  It\u2019s also a benefit in that her clothes don\u2019t get damaged and she can display them better.  Norma is a widow and her children are adults so having the business makes her feel useful.  She will use the loan she\u2019s getting to buy clothes to better stock her store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1144443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Suburbio)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-08-02T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-01T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":640.17,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":49},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":51.27},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":53.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":54.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":57.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":58.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":60.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.64},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.67,"local_amount":95.21,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":96.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340456,"comment":null},{"amount":49.75,"local_amount":49,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":49.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096828,"comment":null},{"amount":51.27,"local_amount":50.49,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":51.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331185,"comment":null},{"amount":52.06,"local_amount":51.27,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939828,"comment":null},{"amount":53.54,"local_amount":52.73,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":53.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072248,"comment":null},{"amount":54.47,"local_amount":53.65,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":54.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318604,"comment":null},{"amount":55.71,"local_amount":54.87,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":55.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013349,"comment":null},{"amount":57.65,"local_amount":56.78,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":57.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453711,"comment":null},{"amount":57.88,"local_amount":57,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:22Z","rounded_local_amount":57.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459558,"comment":null},{"amount":121,"local_amount":119.17,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087883,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-23T10:04:17Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":451245,"name":"Victor Fidel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Victor tiene un taller de ebanister\u00eda en su casa ubicada en Isla Trinitaria, viene en una cooperativa que tiene poco tiempo por lo que su casa es propia.

She is married and has a 17 year old son that goes to shool, while her husband is a construction manager. \r\n\r\nLaura decided a year ago to start selling chickens after she originally started raising them for her personal consumption. Soon her relatives and neighbors asked if she she had any to sell, which ultimately led her to consider this as an option. Since then, she has been raising chickens of different sizes in several sheds. She does all the work on her own and sells chickens 2 or 3 days a week depending on how many orders she has. Laura admits that raising large quantities of these little animals entails a lot of care given that many die for various reasons because they are so delicate. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy chickens and pigs that she wants to raise, as well as vitamins and animal feed. She hopes that, in the future, she can have a bigger business to raise other animals.

They are involved in a variety of enterprises such as commerce, services etc.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is 21-year old Se\u00f1or \u00c1ngel who lives with his partner. They don't yet have any children; she is a housewife. \u00c1ngel and the rest of the group hope to advance their businesses with the help of loans from the institution. They are simple but hardworking people who hope to get on in life.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel has worked as an automotive mechanic for over five years. In this time he learned the trade. He hopes to run his own repair shop one day and make a better future for himself and his family. With this loan he wishes to buy certain tools and in this way gradually gather what he needs to set up his own business.

The community celebrates the local traditions and festivals like the costume ball and the vaca loca [crazy cow], the castle fireworks, and more. Most of the residents farm or raise poultry, planting corn, beans, wheat, peas, and soy, and make rope. The people are friendly and kind and are very proud of keeping the local traditions alive.\r\n\r\nZoila Mar\u00eda, 52, is one of the bank's members. She is married, and 4 of her 5 children from the marriage are adults who work and offer her financial support. Her youngest son is 11 and attends a small public school. Her husband has been a construction worker since he was very young, and they own their home.\r\n\r\nZoila Mar\u00eda works very hard tilling her fields. Her harvests feed the family; if there is surplus food, she sells it. She also raises and sells guinea pigs, sheep, chicken, and cattle. She still makes rope so that she doesn't lose the skills that her parents taught her. She has been a member of the communal bank for 6 years, and she will use this new loan to buy sheep, chicken, and animal feed. Her goal is to own more animals.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1145823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep, chicken, and animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-08-03T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-02T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda  Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Zoila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoila Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":195.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":587.49,"local_amount":587.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":587.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391571,"comment":null},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":391.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":391.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150470,"comment":null},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":391.66,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":391.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383577,"comment":null},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":391.66,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":391.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990581,"comment":null},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":391.66,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":391.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126977,"comment":null},{"amount":195.87,"local_amount":195.87,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":195.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517559,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-18T19:16:17Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":457410,"name":"S\u00e8nad\u00e9 Julienne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9e de 42 ans, S\u00e8nad\u00e9 Julienne vit avec son \u00e9poux et ses trois enfants qui sont tous scolaris\u00e9s dans une \u00e9cole de la ville.

other types of groceries. It had always been Ana Karen\u2019s dream to own her own business and she enjoys the flexibility that comes with being her own boss. \n\nFor three years, Ana Karen and her husband have been managing this business using only a pen and a notebook, tracking sales and purchases for over 1,000 products without the help of any technology. This rudimentary system obviously does not help her to identify the best products, keep sufficient inventory on the shelves or even know the profitability of the store. Ana Karen purchased Tiendatek because she wants to have more control over her business than a pen-and-paper system permits, having real-time information about prices, inventory and suppliers at her fingertips. Ana Karen's goal is to improve the profitability of her business and increase the variety of products she offers her customers in order to continue providing stability for her family.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":336.46,"image":{"id":1157272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She carries out this transportation service every day from 7:30 in the morning until 10 at night. On weekends she prepares food since it's when she sells more families generally go out on these days. As these businesses are separate they help her pay her expenses and enable her to provide financial security to her children. The loan that Dacia is requesting is to buy chicken and sausage to sell. In the future she hopes to take up selling wholesale chicken again since it gave her better earnings and thus continue forward with the

is a 50-year-old woman dealing in livestock trade. She borrowed UGX 3,000,000 to buy more bulls for sale. Elgarida has been in that business for the last 10 years and has gained a lot of experience in it.\r\n\r\nElgarida credits her success to her humble beginnings and determination. She says that she started business with only three goats but now, she can sell three bulls on a single market day.

They live in Tarqui Parish in Cuenca, which experiences cold weather. Its large plains provide beautiful landscapes and allow everyone to enjoy the peace and nature. The parish center is a mixture of colonial and modern architecture. The people are kind, pleasant, and have warm hearts. They make a living in agriculture, livestock breeding, and many people work daily in the city. However, they maintain the culture and traditions of their towns.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Susana. She is 28 years old, married, and has two children who are 7 and 5 years old. Her husband works as a builder. The house they live in is on their own property.\r\n\r\nSusana spends most of her time taking care of her children who are still young. When needed, she works as a domestic employee and also raises chickens, guinea pigs, and livestock at home. She sells them when she has a financial need.\r\n\r\nThis is the third loan that she is receiving from the communal bank. She will invest it in buying fertilizer for the pastures and animal feed.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to finish some needed projects in her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6050,"image":{"id":1147023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

Her husband is Eutiquio, and she is a mother to her children.  She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nJulia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJulia hopes to have a good life and that her business will grow and expand through all her hard work on it.

Her husband is retired and stays home.  They own their home, which is the fruit of their work together. She is very content since she is successfully recuperating from a fall that she suffered.  The other members of the family enjoy very good health.\r\n\r\nShe raises and sells animals, and she has been doing this for 30 years.  She also does other kinds of work, which allows her to improve her family's financial situation.  Having her own business has allowed her to stay close to her family.  She used her previous loan to purchase animals for her business, and the profit she obtained was very helpful, as she had to buy medicines to improve her health.  For this reason, she was a little late in repaying her previous loan.  Her new loan is to buy guinea pigs and chickens.  She likes the communal bank because all of the members are very kind and

is Evelyn, 42, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is already a widow and her children are still studying.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her daily expenses.  \r\n\r\nEvelyn operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEvelyn dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own restaurant. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

is Margie, 32, a resident of Manila, Philippines. Her husband is Ruben and she is the mother of her child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMargie maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMargie dreams of expanding her business and helping her child finish his studies through all her hard work in her business.

She sells juices to be able to cover her education expenses since the university that she attends is private and she has to make monthly payments for her classes.

is a hog raiser from San Roque.

Her earnings go for their meals and part of the income serves as revolving capital for the business. \r\n\r\nMaxima would like to keep improving the growth of her hogs.

For this reason Yasvir, seeing that her family had everyday needs which were not being met, decided to start her own business and opened a small stall to sell sweets in a mobile manner. At first it was difficult for her to make her business successful and look after her first child. For this reason her mother, with whom she also lives, decided to help her with looking after her son. She has been able to obtain a well-located place were her products are in higher demand. She has situated herself in front of the university of her town. Her main customers are the young university students. Since her sales have improved, she is asking for a loan to buy more merchandise such as biscuits, sweets, snacks and soft drinks. \r\n\r\nYasvir has been a member of EDAPROSPO for just over a year, and is very grateful to KIVA and EDAPROSPO because they have supported her business and believed her word and in her dream which was to expand her business and give her children a good quality of life.

The work was tiring, but it paid very well whenever he had available jobs.  However, he also endured stretches of time without any work.  When he got married and acquired responsibilities, Pedro looked to find a business that could provide greater financial stability.  Therefore, he began selling natural products.  Pedro established this business with his wife and together they make a great team.  By making sales together, there is a lower risk that someone will rob them.  They have been in business for several years and have established customers who they visit.  Another strategy that they utilize for their business is to find a busy place where they can conduct demonstrations and offer samples in hopes of making direct sales.  Since his children are older, Pedro does not work according to an established schedule.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Pedro will buy products to sell and have money available for making presentations.

Most of the members already know one another.  They are responsible, enthusiastic, and most of all, punctual with their payments.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members is Juana.  She is married to Rafael, who works as a chauffeur.  Living only on her husband\u2019s income is not enough to meet the household needs, so Juana started a small business without much effort.  She raises chickens from her home and then sells them in the town squares and at the fairs near her home.  Juana is able to manage her business without neglecting her duties as a homemaker since she has two daughters who are in school.  Little by little, her business has grown since she has also started selling to large prestigious restaurants in her town.  Juana will use her loan to buy special balanced feed for her chickens, but she will also buy more birds.  Her dream is to have enough cash to build her own chicken coop that is large enough to house a great number of birds.  \r\n<p>\r\nJuana began working with EDAPROSPO more than two years ago.  All of her loans have been invested in her prospering business.  In the photo, Juana is the second person on the right wearing a red sweater and carrying a brown purse over her arm.

The products she sells at the cafe are jello for $.25, cookies for $.30, and potato chips for $.35. She works there alone because the school only has 180 students, so it is not beneficial to have an assistant because it would affect her profits at such a small cafe. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy a toaster, a blender, a small refrigerator, and merchandise so she can sell a variety of products.

Teodora belongs to the group Juventud y Desarrollo-Chupaca (Youth and Development-Chupaca).  This group has already been working with EDAPROSPO for more than a year.  It is made up of nine people, among them one man and the rest are women.  It is a very charismatic and supportive group among its members.  Teodora is a 41-year-old woman, married with two children, the oldest is 12 years old and the second child is only three years old.  She has been working in this business for more than six years.  Everything began because what her husband earned wasn\u2019t enough as her oldest child had to begin to study in a school and the expenses of those studies weren\u2019t able to be covered with the little amount that her husband earned.  This made Teodora start selling some vegetables that she planted in the garden of her own house and as her customers asked her for other vegetables she decided to implement in her business buying other vegetables that she couldn\u2019t cultivate.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan she will buy a large quantity of potatoes, onions, garlic and other vegetables so that her earnings will be better.  She dreams of a time when she has her own stall for her sales since she only sells her vegetables as a street seller in different markets and squares in her town.  Improving her income, Teodora is sure that she will be able to give to her children everything that she didn't have when she was young, since her parents were in a very humble condition.\r\n\r\nTeodora gives thanks to everyone who invests in all of the stories of hardworking people.  \r\n\r\nTeodora is dressed in a polo shirt and red apron and is the second person from the right in the second row.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1148951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy potatoes, garlic, onions, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Venancia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Clara Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yasmin Rossi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gustavo Agripino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301372449,"comment":null},{"amount":320.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":842.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308131447,"comment":null},{"amount":320.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":842.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315367347,"comment":null},{"amount":320.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":842.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322976529,"comment":null},{"amount":320.84,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":842.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331113687,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-18T12:14:49Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:54:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454141,"name":"Geofrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geofrey is age 30 and lives in Masindi, Uganda.

She really likes what she does, because ever since she was very young she was taught to value hard work and how to cope with difficult situations.

She is resolute and cheerful as well.  She is separated from the father of her son Joseph, age 7. She lives in her mother's house, along with her mother, her three sisters, one brother-in-law, and her son.  \r\n\r\nShe sells typical foods from the region such as \"juanes\" (rice wrapped in leaves), and \"patarashca\" (fish wrapped in leaves).  These are very popular dishes for consumption since they are traditional foods from the area, but she also prepares various foods. For this reason, every afternoon she sets up a table at the front of her house where she kindly serves her customers, most of whom are neighbors. She has been doing this work for 2 years, managing to grow her clientele, and up until now doing it alone.  She likes her work because it provides income to assist with household expenses, in addition to allowing her to be at home to care for her young son. On the other hand, she does not like it when it rains very often, because it makes sales very slow, but that doesn't discourage her.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the MFP institution and she is grateful for the financial support that helps her to advance her business.

In the Philippines, the whole working community, and most of their families, only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPriscilla hopes to have another store in her community and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. She also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1152140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for the raw ingredients and products needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3507.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356277,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2807.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114375,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.97,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3507.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350422,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":702.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959549,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-04T17:21:34Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:46:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":452999,"name":"Raquel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Raquel tiene 20 a\u00f1os, es una mujer trabajadora y con muchas ganas de salir adelante.

Her partner is Richard, 40, and together they have two children: Yeni, 13, and Richard, 7.\r\n\r\nOdalis has a business buying and selling moto-cars (light, 3-wheeled passenger vehicles).  She carries out her business in her house, which is located in a very busy corner of her neighborhood.  Here she awaits the arrival of customers, or she goes out to find them, something she commonly does because she doesn't like to be without anything to do.  When she is selling the vehicles, she is always aware of providing all of the documents required by law, and that the vehicles are in optimal condition.  She has been doing this work for nearly 5 years, and she works alongside her husband.  He is in charge of reconditioning the vehicles that they put up for sale.  Odalis enjoys her work, because it allows her to have a good income.

In addition to this, he also works as a security guard at night in one of the main markets in the city.  He has been doing this work for 7 years, and although he acknowledges that at first he had trouble adapting to a daily routine, he learned to manage his time with hours of rest and a fixed work schedule.  Ever since the time he started doing these activities he has worked alone, and he is always on the lookout for new opportunities.  For this reason, he now wants to set up another business in his house selling beer and soft drinks, because in his neighborhood no one has chosen this type of business.  He hopes to do this very soon, and to continue to exert himself in everything he does for the good of his family.\r\n\r\nThis is his 12th loan with the MFP institution.
