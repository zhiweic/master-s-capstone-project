Nancy and other promoters in her community - Everlyne, Paulo and Solomon, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Nancy will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. She wants to be a promoter because she believes the program will help prevent waterborne diseases. Nancy believes that the dispenser will help her community prevent sickness and access safe water.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.  Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Nancy\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"To reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-10-14T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-13T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solomon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-14T16:30:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615755,"name":"Florence's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence of Museywa village in Jipchekwen, Kenya, has volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser. 42 year old Florence has some primary school education.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Benjamin and the 10 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nBenjamin has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low.

Vincent and other promoters in his community including Fred, Violet, Phanice, and Anne need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Vincent will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. He wants to be a promoter because he loves his community and now that they have received this important gadget for water treatment, he believes it is important to take advantage of the opportunity. Vincent believes that the dispenser provides safe water and improves their health making them less sick. This also means they will spend less money going to the hospital. Additionally, healthier lives will enable them to do their work properly and earn a living.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Vincent\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1449061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"To support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-10-14T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-13T11:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vincent ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phanice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T11:57:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618718,"name":"Linda's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linda lives in a house with mud walls, a dirt floor, and an iron roof house in Sheveye village in Mulundu, Kenya with her family including 2 children. She has completed her primary school education and is currently working as a maize farmer. Linda is also very active in her community's women's group. The community of Sheveye village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Sheveye\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Sheveye, 10 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water.  Linda has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.  She is known in the community as being friendly and has volunteered because she loves her people. Someone in Linda's family has suffered from a water borne disease in the past so she believes that the chlorine will help kill germs in their drinking water. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Linda, Phyllip, Barris, Abel, and Iren.\n\nSheveye village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

It was shortly thereafter that Naimah discovered that two of her children had learning disabilities. In an effort to help them, she spent two summers in New York City learning the Spalding Reading method in order to teach her children how to read. She realized she had a knack for teaching and began teaching both children and adults how to read, meeting them in their homes and at local fast food establishments.\r\n\r\nThrough hard work and dedication, Naimah obtained an AS in Small Business Management and was pursuing a BA in General Business. However, Naimah endured another setback when she was diagnosed with carpal tunnel and fibromyalgia. \"The doctor suggested I change my lifestyle, so I did. I quit a high-paying job at a utility company and started my life all over again,\" she says. It was after this setback that Naimah returned to teaching. She obtained her Masters in elementary curriculums, certificate in graduate studies in early childhood, and a Master's in adult learning. It was after this that she launched Babbling Brook Family Tutoring Services (BBFTS).\r\n\r\nBBFTS will offer after-school programs as well as general services for those who want to improve their grammar and conversational skills.

She awaits your kindness and relies on your generosity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":117,"image":{"id":1444106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","use":"to help her son-in-law to start a business, making concrete ladders (used to form concrete blocks) to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Phnom Penh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.55 104.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-10-14T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-13T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Keu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39,"local_amount":39,"processed_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T09:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420254232,"comment":null},{"amount":39,"local_amount":39,"processed_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429518802,"comment":null},{"amount":39,"local_amount":39,"processed_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439742926,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T11:21:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":617218,"name":"Ha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ha was born in 1994.

Margarita's work is renting out a taxicab. She has a vehicle she bought many years ago. Each day, a driver arrives at her house and is responsible for a route through the main streets of the city. She receives a small amount from renting her car everyday that helps to cover some needs in her home. She has carried out this activity for 8 years, since she was able to purchase a taxi in the public service after much effort and a constant struggle in her previous job. Her previous job was sewing which she had to stop performing because of health reasons. Currently, she sees the possibility of entering the laundry business because she believes it is a very profitable job. In the area where she lives, there are people who have high-pressure jobs who do not have time to do their laundry and have requested this service. She is waiting to buy a washing machine in the near future. For the moment, she likes to rent her taxi because it allows her to spend her free time caring for her children and perform other jobs to eventually improve her family's income and improve their standard of living. Now she feels at peace regarding all that she is pursuing and hopes in the future to consolidate a formal company in both jobs that she undertakes. This is her 6th loan with Kiva and she is very happy to know she has financial support that allows her to continue with her work. With the amount requested of 2,000 soles, she will change a few tires in her cab and buy some parts it needs for proper functioning as well as invest in the purchase of a washer to engage in this business.

But this stroke of fate has not broken him, and to this day he continues to live and be happy for other people. Orifdzhon is a very hardworking man who lives with his parents and, in order to not be fully dependent on them, runs his own business. He sells CDs at the local market, for which he has a small stall. He receives good earnings from this business and is able to help his parents cover living costs.

At the same time, he works as a taxi driver, using his own private vehicle. Ikromjon tries with all his might to ensure his family has enough, since he is the only earner in the family.

It is for this reason Monicah is asking Kiva lenders to assist her with the loan so that she can secure a water pump as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1448509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to obtain a water pump for irrigation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chibombo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-10-14T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-13T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monicah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":2610,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-15T02:04:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":620103,"name":"Irma Marleny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Irma es una mujer de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, casada y madre de 4 hijos los cuales viven en familia todos juntos tres de ellos estudian en diferentes grados de primaria y el mayor en secundaria.

She lives in northern Tajikistan with her family.  She was born and raised in the countryside.  As a child, she used to help her parents who were involved in crop farming and animal husbandry.  After she got married, she started her own animal husbandry business, which she has been running for more than 20 years.\r\n\r\nDono raises two children.

Her work consists of dedicating the best of care and maintenance to her fields since it is an indispensable requirement for obtaining a harvest with commercial value, making this activity profitable.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a good harvest she usually fertilizes her land with organic fertilizer. She really likes to participate in the harvesting where it is necessary to contract local workers in order to reduce the workload, and making this task a collective and enjoyable task.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva and she feels thankful for the financial support that she is receiving to move forward. Additionally she is committed to making her payments in a punctual manner.

In this way she will be able to give better and more secure maintenance of her crops.\r\n\r\nHer future plan is to have a large plantation offering variety to her customers and all those who consume her products, to generate more income which will strengthen the inheritance left to her children and grandchildren, who will continue to work the land from generation to generation.

She is divorced and has two children (Alexander, 16, and Kevin, 9) that live with her in a house her ex-husband left her. The biggest challenge she has had to face was the divorce, since her husband was who covered the home expenses. She then had to look for a job, which was difficult at the beginning because it was difficult to find someone to take care of her children. Laura started working with one of her sisters, raising chickens.\r\n\r\nLaura has given her children unconditional support, since their father has not supported them for a long time. Laura works today raising and selling chickens, which she keeps in small pens. She learned this activity from her sister, who has been helping her for a while now. Besides poultry, she also sells beauty products on a catalog.

Even though it is difficult to care for the birds as well as spending time working, C\u00e9sar makes sure he has enough time for his children, at least on weekends.\r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar has a very big and important life dream, and that is to have his own house which he can share with his children.
