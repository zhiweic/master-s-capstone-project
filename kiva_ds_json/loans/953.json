is 62 years old. She is married to a farmer. She has been a maize farmer for 25 years. She will use Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer purchases for maize production. She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase her production. She wishes to invest the profits from her farming in the business so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo taken recently at another maize farming plantation, shows her very happy and excited that previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The idea for her business was born when she learned this skill with her uncle 21 years ago. After this she worked in a recycling company for 9 years and when she was left unemployed, she used her severance pay to purchase three machines but she wasn\u2019t satisfied with that. She then decided to make her work more technical so she began to study scales and patterns at The National Learning Service. At the moment her main products are Bermuda shorts, jeans and sports clothes which she sells to private customers and neighbors. She carries out all the activities of her trade in her workshop, such as cutting, sewing, finishing, ironing and packing and she sells everyday on credit. She makes her purchases in cash in fabric stores in Barranquilla city center. She is currently applying for a credikiva (her first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) with which she will purchase fabric, threads, buttons, zips and general accessories for dressmaking. This investment will help her to improve her business because she will be able to fulfill her orders and manufacture women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s clothes. She needs to maintain stock for Love and Friendship day which is upcoming and will impact her customer base. Her credikiva investment will improve her response to orders and increase her sales.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He will use the Kiva loan to cover labor costs and to buy fertilizer during maize production: He needs fertilizer to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines, like tractors, that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Boniface posed with dried maize plants. He was very happy to share with us the information about his business and excited that previous season was very productive for both family needs and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He will use the Kiva loan to cover labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production: He needs fertilizer to increase his production. He plans to reinvest profits back into his business so that in the future he can acquire machines, like tractors, that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThis photo was taken recently during a previous maize harvest. Jean Baptiste was very happy and excited that the previous season was very productive for both family needs and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Debora Trust Bank is made up of 11 enthusiastic women and is found in the small village of Xecaracoj, located in the western highlands of Guatemala. Many residents of Xercaracoj dedicate their careers to commerce (inlcuding selling produce, groceries and hardware); other villagers also make a living in manufacturing traditional clothing and animal husbandry. Xecaracoj is a rural community where many people still speak the native language of K\u2019iche.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Debora Trust Bank, Elvira is a 33-year-old married woman with two children. When Elvira was very young, her father passed away, leaving her with no other means of support. She and her siblings left school to work for family income.  Having only completed a year of school, Elvira dedicated herself to the art of hand embroidery and animal husbandry to support her family. Today, Elvira runs a small convenience store out of her house.\r\n\r\nEach month, when the Debora Trust Bank has a repayment meeting, members also receive non-formal education as part of their participation in the Microcredit Plus program through Friendship Bridge.  Elvira recently attended the advanced training for baking, and wants to incorporate a bakery into her convenience store, specializing in donuts. With a new loan she will buy inventory to enhance her store and all the materials necessary to start baking donuts.  \r\n\r\nElvira dreams of expanding her business through the bakery, which will gain her access to new clientele. She is a very positive woman who now has the self-confidence to grow her business and earn extra income to obtain her goal of keeping her children in school. In addition, she appreciates other training she has received through Friendship Bridge, including lessons on money management, which will help her with business growth.\r\n    \r\nElvira is one of 11 women who make up the Debora Trust Bank. Each have different life stories, but their common goal is to change their future and the future of their families. They are grateful for the investment that people around the world are making in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5525,"image":{"id":1197699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To buy inventory to enhance her store and materials to start baking donuts.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRencie operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy textiles from the textile factory, and sells them with a little profit. Her products are carpets, curtains, shower curtains and the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stocks of textile items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRencie hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and dreams to have her own vehicle. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

years old and a mother of three children.  To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 1988, having started this business with a sum of 7,000 som, spent on buying a calf.  Thanks to Syinat's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow, one calf and ten sheep, and the monthly income amounts to about 5,000 som.  The earnings from the business allow her to pay for her daughter's education.  In order to further develop her business, Syinat requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy four heifers.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and making major repairs to her house next

man with a huge kind heart and a beautiful soul, who lives among the tall Tajik mountains, needs your support as he has encountered financial difficulties. His name is Izzatullo. He is 55 years old, married, and raising 4 children. The climate around his home is very favourable for crop and animal farming. Izzatullo has been raising livestock for over 7 years and currently keeps several cows and sheep. He also has a large parcel of land where he grows grass for his animals. Izzatullo sells milk to his neighbours, who are happy to receive his natural dairy. Additionally, Izzatullo sells livestock after taking care of it for several months, and has many customers at the market.\r\n\r\nIzzatullo would like to develop his business but does not have sufficient funds for doing so. He is requesting a loan of US$1000 to purchase livestock in order to expand his business. He plans to use his profits to provide his children with modern technology.

She helps support a family of seven, including four grandchildren. Alice has borrowed a loan from VEP to install a biogas plant to replace her existing energy sources from firewood, charcoal, and paraffin with biogas, which is a cleaner and cheaper source of energy.\n\nWith her biodigester, Alice will treat her five dairy cows' waste. This waste treatment is not only cleaner and safer than other methods, but it will also generate enough fuel for cooking and lighting, allowing Alice to save approximately 1,500 Kenyan Shillings that she currently spends per month to buy charcoal and paraffin. \n\nThese savings, plus income from selling milk, will allow her pay off the loan and take care of her family. With a biodigester she will also practice organic agriculture using the bioslurry and will consequently increase her crop production.

He lives in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in Esmeraldas Province that supplies various cities in Ecuador with plantain, cocoa beans, coffee, African palm and forest products; most of its inhabitants work in commerce to get ahead and even more so now that roads to this canton have been improved allowing for much increased commercial activity especially on weekends when all types of merchants head out to the street market to sell products to potential customers who for the most part are farmers.  Tourism is also an important income producer for this canton because its natural ecosystem is quite varied; there are waterfalls, fresh water rivers, forests to visit and there are flowers and animals to decorate this city.\r\n\r\nJulio has worked in agriculture, especially growing African palm, for five years.  He has several goals set but his obstacle has always been the lack of capital.  However, this time he\u2019s asked Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a loan to build structures that will make it possible to store his harvested products and lessen losses due to poor crop care.  Julio hopes with this loan that his income will increase to be able to provide his children with a quality education so that they can become excellent

According to VEP's research, an average household of five members consumes approximately $2 of paraffin per day to light their homes. This fuel source is not only more expensive than solar lighting, but it is also polluting and unsafe. Another product offering, clean cookstoves, will reduce households' dependence on firewood by 50%.

Constituye el centro administrativo, econ\u00f3mico y cultural de la regi\u00f3n, siendo la ciudad m\u00e1s importante del Valle Central chileno. Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n\n\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cLa Esperanza II\u201d (Hope II); it\u2019s composed of 15 entrepreneurs who work in a variety of lines of work among which there are stores, clothing sales, bookstore, plastics sales, bread sales, jewelry sales and services, among others.  All of them live in the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nKatherine is a member of this communal bank and in the photo she\u2019s standing in the front row first from right to left.  She\u2019s wearing a black jacket and her hair is dark brown and she wears it loose; she\u2019s also wearing a pair of white pearl earrings.\r\n\r\nShe sells second-hand, used clothes.  She\u2019s been in business six years and she comments that she works Saturdays and Sundays from 8am until 1pm because during the week she cares for her youngest son.  She sets up in the free street markets and she sells clothes for both adults and children.  The merchandise she needs she buys in the city of Santiago from various suppliers where bundles of clothing can be had for low cost which is an economic advantage.  She will use the loan to buy bundles of mixed clothes to stock her business.\r\n\r\nOne of Katherine\u2019s business goals is to make it grow and to perhaps be able to open a store at home to sell her wares there more comfortably.  Katherine lives with her two children who are 20 and 1 year old.  Her oldest son is employed.  Her dream at the work level is to have a home-based business to generate higher income and provide better quality of life for her children.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza is giving her because it will allow her to invest in her business.  With respect to the communal bank group she\u2019s part of she comments that very good communication exists among them.  On the other hand, the training sessions have been useful to learn new sales and bookkeeping strategies.\r\n\r\nTalca is part of the Maule region located in the center of the country.  It\u2019s the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region; it\u2019s the most important city in the Chilean central valley.  A curious phrase exists in Chile referring to Talca: \u201cTalca, Paris y Londres.\u201d  Among the myths explaining it some say it comes from something originally said by an Englishman: \u201cTalca parece Londres,\u201d because of the abundant fog that frequently blankets the city in winter similar to what happens in the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1201357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She belongs to the Renacer communal bank, and this is its first loan cycle. She says that it is hard to find a responsible communal bank, so she decided to work with Vision Fund. She had been told that the credit institution was committed to its borrowers and that her group made its payments. \r\n\r\nA year ago, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe set up an Internet cafe in her house since she was no longer in school. She started a business to earn income to help her parents with her siblings' expenses. She chose this business because she is familiar with computers and has taken information technology courses. She began by doing work that students sent to her. She bought one computer, then another, and soon had three to rent and one to use herself. She is applying to Vision Fund for a loan to buy a multi-purpose printer that can scan and make color copies, since she already has a black-and-white printer. Having this printer will add business. She also wants to buy cartridges for her other printer, CDs to burn, white paper, pencils, and so forth. She dreams of having more computers because at times her customers get tired of waiting for one and she loses the business. She believes that the investment will turn out well because she wants to work hard and get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe other eight members are Rosalba, Francisca, Rosario, Mar\u00eda Elisa, Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, Juan Jos\u00e9, Elizabeth, and Jos\u00e9 Luis.

Neither of them are under her care anymore, as they both have their own families. Bertha Margarita's business consists of a silk screen printing shop and sound system rentals. She has 12 years of business experience, making berets, costume ribbons, and parade regalia, mainly for civic holidays, graduations, and end of school year events. Also, on the weekends she rents out an entertainment sound system for private parties and school functions. That's Bertha Margarita's daily routine, showing her to be a very hard-working and responsible woman who pays her bills on time and reliably. \r\n\r\nBertha has taken out loans in the past for her business, which is located in her home. She is seeking this loan in order to invest in raw materials to fill the various orders she receives from her customers.

She\u2019s 25-years-old and completed sixth grade but was unable to continue with her education because her parents couldn\u2019t afford it; they were unable to cover expenses because she has other siblings so they started to learn the family business which is making pots and clay crafts to help their parents with household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe says that her parents have taught her how to make an infinite number of crafts in various sizes and styles and once she got married she continued the tradition and now has had her own business for about 10 years since she married very young.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she heads out to sell her creations in various street markets, expo fairs and in communities adjacent to hers and that she does well with the sales because everything she makes she does with much affection and dedication so that they will sell more quickly.\r\n\r\nRight now she\u2019s asking Vision Fund for a loan to buy several things she needs to make her crafts like clay, firewood to fire the crafts, enamel, paint in various colors and many more things.  She says that the goal is to rent a locale near the highway so that tourists will see and buy her creations and she won\u2019t have to leave home so often and she can be more stable and care for her little children.\r\n\r\nThe other four group members are Araceli, Leticia, Mar\u00eda Fernanda and Guadalupe.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

is Ramona, 35, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Jessie, a construction worker, and she is a mother to her children. She manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRamona operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it for a little profit. Most of her products are personal products like lingerie. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. She earns a minimum of 2,500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales weekly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy RTW (ready to wear) products and merchandise to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRamona hopes to be able to expand her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1199102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for additional merchandise to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-26T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-26T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2781.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114784,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2780.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350841,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959946,"comment":null},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":555.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-26T09:45:25Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":476245,"name":"Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Antonia se dedica a vender abarrotes en su tienda, ella cuenta que Finca le ayud\u00f3 a abrir su tienda, cuenta que le gusta las reuniones de su Banco Comunal, tambi\u00e9n pasa un bonito momento con sus amigas del BC, solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la implementaci\u00f3n de su tienda.","en":"Antonia works selling groceries in her shop.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

is a conservative woman who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo, cutting wood for his carpentry business. Azhar is a 33-year-old mother of two sons and one daughter. Her husband earns only a low salary, which is not enough to cover the family's needs. For the past four years, he has been operating his business, which has been a profitable project but needs more financial support.\r\n\r\nAzhar is requesting a loan from microfinance organization FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing more wood. This will increase the capacity of his business and enable her husband to take additional requests from customers, which will improve the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma is requesting a from Credo to re-start-up her family business which she had to stop due to financial problems. She will use her loan to purchase land to cultivate wheat. Irma's goals are to plant and harvest a good quality production that she will sell at a good price to increase her family's income. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

It totals 104 GEL per month. It is hardly enough for food for a four-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEter requested loan from Credo to re-start-up a family business, which was stopped recently because of the illness of the child and financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Eter will purchase a horse. Aleksandre will go to the local forest and use the horse to bring wood from the forest. They will sell the wood in the village and earn income. The wood is mainly used by the village population for ovens to heat the houses and cook. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income of the family. Eter hopes that the income will be enough for the family and the new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve their living conditions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

41, is a resident of Payatas, Philippines. She is married to Jonald, a family driver, and they have five children. She, together with her husband, manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNorma operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the entire working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands (cooked food) cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNorma hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams to give her children a quality education.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRemy hopes to give her children a good and high quality education, and she dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He is married to a farmer. He has been a maize farmer for 20 years. He will use the Kiva loan to cover labor costs and fertilizer for maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With the profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken on the previous maize field, which the borrower will still use for this new season. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
