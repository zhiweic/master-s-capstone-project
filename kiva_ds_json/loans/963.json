MDO Arvand for financial support as she needs to organize a celebration for her grandson. A year ago she gave her daughter away in marriage. Now that her daughter has given birth to a son, Manzura has to organize a celebration and buy some gifts. Manzura works as a dispatcher, but her salary is sufficient only for running expenses. Her husband  is a migrant worker [in the Russian Federation]; he send them money, but it is not enough for major purchases.

is 44 years old and married. She is a contented client of Kashf foundation who helps her husband in the business of shoemaking.  Her husband has been attached to the business for about 15 years. He worked really hard in making shoes by hand. \r\n\r\nYears later, Roubi got knowledge about the cost-effective financial services of Kashf foundation.  She applied for a loan to expand their business and purchase the raw materials, such as soles and plastic leather in the amalgamation of shoes to gain the maximum. \r\n\r\nBut to prepare the maximum number of shoes manually was hard and took time. After the acquisition of next loan, they purchased a shoe-stitching machine. Moreover, their sons assisted in the same business, to make the work easy and maximize the production.  Their sale increased up to double, and profit got healthier consequently. \r\n\r\nNow one of her son deals in sales and marketing in the local market, and they are reaping the reasonable benefit from their well established business. Their joint efforts enable them to cover the expenditures of all the basic amenities of life, like utilities, electrical home appliances, personal conveyance (motorbike), health facilities,etc.\r\n\r\nAt present Roubi has requested a loan of Rs. 40,000 to buy more raw materials, such as leather, plastic leather, soles, and reels of threads. In this way, she would be able to cater to more customers consistently. \r\n\r\nAs a future plan, they are eager to expand their business by manufacturing different types of shoes, such as school shoes, kids shoes, etc., to cater to many customers. \r\n\r\nRoubi openly acknowledge the services provided to all clients by Kashf Foundation at their doorstep, such as education and training in financial activities like budgeting, savings, information about various facilities of depositing their monthly installment at the nearest UBL Omni outlet, due awareness, and training about their respective business's growth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":424.8,"image":{"id":1206707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To buy more raw materials, such as leather, plastic leather, soles and reels of threads.

Magdalena invests between 12 and 15 uninterrupted hours every day to her work. She estimates that in the time when students from primary and secondary school start their normal period of classes, there will be an increased demand for the products she sells. For that reason, she approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to ask for a loan in order to buy products that will allow her to offer a greater variety to her customers. She is grateful for this loan and for the assistance and training she received at the foundation, so that she may provide better service to her customers and in this way position herself in the industry, increase her income, and improve her quality of life both now and in the future.

She did not get married due to lacking the money for a wedding. Four years ago, she started a parlor in a small corner of her two-room house. Along with her younger sister Sameen, she works hard day and night to give the parlor a strong local reputation so that they may be able to provide for the family. \r\n\r\nFarzana and Sameen labor tirelessly to keep the business running because they are the breadwinners of the house. There are seven dependents on these two women since none of their siblings are old enough to earn themselves. Two of their sisters are enrolled in school. \r\n\r\nThe sisters have reported to Kashf that it has been getting extremely difficult to manage the family, as the parlor is running on minimal necessities, causing clients to be hesitant to avail themselves of the parlor's services. This is why Farzana has requested a loan worth RS 25,000 from Kashf.

He is from the municipality of Malpaisillo, married, and has two children who are 17 and 15 years old and who are studying in high school. His business is the sale of fuel, lubricants, and replacement bicycle parts. He started in this business 8 years ago. He started it of his own initiative because he needed an income for his family. He took advantage of the fact that in the town where he lives, no one else provided this service. His business was well accepted, so he became established and now he has many customers. Andr\u00e9s has had other loans in the past and he has demonstrated his responsibility by making his repayments on schedule. He needs the loan to invest in working capital and to buy products such as: fuel, bicycle parts, tires, brakes, pedals, spokes, and grease. Adr\u00e9s is thankful for the help that the Kiva lenders provide to people of few financial resources so that they can have a dignified way of working in countries with so many needs, like

He has lived in a in a government-subsidized house for 12 years. He works in a local factor as a production supervisor. He has two goals that he has worked towards for a long time. One of them is to be able to give his children professional careers. Things were difficult for him since he only finished primary school, because his family needed him to work from the time he was very young. He set this goal when he had his own children. He went to work day and night so that they could finish their studies, and he is still doing this. His other goal is to provide his family with a dignified place to live.

is 53 years old from the town of Bien Unido, Bohol. She is married, with four adult children. \r\n\r\nFor 12 years now, she has been dependent on her seaweed farming business to provide for her family's needs.

After she decided to follow in their foot steps, \u201cI realized this was my calling and I really enjoy helping people,\u201d she says. \r\n\r\nFor almost four years Bridgette, a mother of five, has led her team at Abundance of Love Home Care. Located in her hometown of St. Louis, \u201cAbundance of Love Home Care is an in-home service that assists individuals and families. We specialize in Alzheimer's and Dementia care. We are dedicated to helping our clients lead dignified, independent lifestyles in the comfort and safety of their homes by carefully assessing and fully understanding their needs, and selectively placing caring and trained personnel to meet those needs,\u201d Bridgette says. \u201cI have always wanted to become an entrepreneur. I always think of ways to make something better or how I can solve a problem.\u201d \r\n\r\nAbundance of Love Home Care is different from other assisted living business in the St. Louis area because \u201cwe dedicate ourselves to incorporating compassion in everything we do; we genuinely care about our clients and we ensure they are comfortable. We want to change the way home care is delivered and continuously give our clients that personal experience,\u201d Bridgette says.\r\n\r\nThough she has not personally had a family member with the disease, Bridgette said each of her caregivers are trained on what the disease is, its stages, and how it affects the family members and patients. She says she believes there are ways to keep patients safe while allowing them \u201cto live dignified lives for as long as they can, because there are some people who live alone with this disease,\u201d she says. \r\n\r\n\u201cCare goes beyond just feeding and bathing,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea is to personalize every person's care by implementing specific physical and mental activities for as long as they can perform them and provide familiarity in their everyday lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nBridgette learned about Accion Texas Inc. via the Internet. She plans to use the loan to market her business and purchase technology that will make delivering care and ease communication between her employees and patient\u2019s family members by electronically sending patient information to family members and health care professionals. \u201cWith this loan I am able to invest in technology and stay innovative in the ever-changing field of healthcare,\u201d Bridgette says. \u201cI can also focus on marketing to get the business known.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe currently employs three workers and said her business \u201cnot only provides a service but more jobs in the community.

He lives in the city of Mala, a city characterized by its agriculture, especially now that they cultivate apples and bananas, among other items. Zenon is a hard working man, above all because he has gotten his two children, 16 and 27 years old, ahead. A few years have passed since his wife died and from this moment he became the father and mother for his children. At first it was difficult, but his love of being a father was stronger. In his free time, which is limited, Zenon plays music and he is part of a small group. Occasionally, he likes to enjoy one of his usual meals, the rich soup with yuca and meat (\"Sopa bruta y Carapulcra\")  with his children. Due to his limited economic resources he could only study up to 5th grade, but he would have liked to study for a university degree.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of effort, and above all else savings, Zenon began his carpentry business 15 years ago. He works about 10 hours a day, but it always varies according to the jobs that his customers put him in charge of. On a daily basis he may work with up to 5 customers. He thinks his business does well because he is very responsible with his customers and above all else, he is honest. \r\n\r\nZenon is very grateful for the Kiva loans. Thanks to the help they have brought him he will be able to buy wood, and he can also improve the facade of his business so that it can be more colorful and attract more customers. This way he will be able to increase his earnings and he will continue fighting to make his biggest dream a reality: to give his children a good education and to have his own home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1203270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to

She has a stand in the market where she sells fruit. She has been selling fruit for eight years! She will use the loan to buy avocados, pineapples, mangoes, and other fruits. Her business strategy is to buy a large sack of fruit in bulk from a village outside of Brazzaville and sell it in the market.

continues the craft of Tajik women, that is, she sews national dresses. She is 34 years old. She is married and raising two children. Her husband receives a small pay. This pay is not enough to provide the family with all necessary means. \r\n\r\nMarifat decided to help her husband for the good of the family. With this aim she attended the course \"Bring it on\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and she received a certificate.

In light of this, he sought a loan of 5,000 quetzals to be able to buy more onion seeds and potatoes along with the inputs that he uses. \r\n\r\nOne of his biggest dreams is to be able to construct his own home in the future, or even better, to buy land where he can cultivate more vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1209232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy potato and onion seeds to cultivate.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2012-10-08T16:00:43Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-07T16:00:43Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":544.22,"local_amount":4186.3,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4344.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356435235,"comment":null},{"amount":105.78,"local_amount":813.7,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T08:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":844.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373072529,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-10T22:23:04Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T08:58:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479355,"name":"Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A la vivienda del se\u00f1or Manuel le esta haciendo falta la reparaci\u00f3n e instalaci\u00f3n de las tuber\u00edas del agua, gas y drenaje de su vivienda, solicita el cr\u00e9dito para solucionar el problema que se le esta presentando con estos servicios ya que son indispensable para su familia.\n El se\u00f1or Manuel  y su esposa son  originario de la ciudad de Nuevo Laredo, tiene dos hijos adolecentes que estudian la preparatoria, el se\u00f1or Manuel es empleado de una compa\u00f1\u00eda de seguridad privada y su esposa se dedica a la venta de ropa afuera de su domicilio y as\u00ed estar al pendiente de la familia.\nCon el sueldo que recibe el se\u00f1or Manuel ser\u00e1 para pagar el cr\u00e9dito y que su esposa le ayudara con las ganancias del negocio con los gastos familiares y escolares.\nDesea mejorar la calidad de vida y el patrimonio de sus hijos.\n","en":"The home of Sr. Manuel needs to have pipes repaired and installed for water, gas, and sewage.

Arcelis tiene un hijo de 5 a\u00f1os y una hija de 14 a\u00f1os, y por eso es muy importante para ella, que sus negocios tengan \u00e9xito, pues quiere garantizar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos con sus ingresos. Tambi\u00e9n, viven ahora en un lugar muy peque\u00f1o, sufriendo el hacinamiento, y espera usar sus ingresos para mejorar las condiciones de la casa y mudarse a un lugar mejor. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un cr\u00e9dito de Kiva,  primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para comprar materias primas e insumos y elaborar prendas de vestir a un buen precio, porque logrando descuentos puede ofrecerlo a su clientela y si tiene el dinero disponible para hacer su compra ahorrar\u00e1 mucho, en la compra de una buena cantidad de insumos, esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n de \u00e9xito de esta inversi\u00f3n. . ","en":"Arcelis, 39, lives in Barranquilla, a Colombian coastal city.  She has two businesses: a clothes making shop and she sells cheese.  She took a sewing course six years ago in a local public school and she and her husband took out a loan that she used to buy a sewing machine.  This is how she started her dressmaking business.  She also earns extra income selling cheese that she sells to a domestic clientele she\u2019s gradually built.\r\n\r\nArcelis has a five-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter and this is why it\u2019s so important that her businesses are successful because she wants to guarantee her children\u2019s education with her income.  In addition, they live in a very small place so are very overcrowded and she hopes to be able to use her income to improve her house and move to a better place.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy raw materials and supplies to make clothing at good prices because by qualifying for discounts she can then pass them down to her customers and if she has money in hand she can save very much when she makes her purchase by buying in volume which is precisely the reason why the investment will be successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1209829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

tiene 68 a\u00f1os y hace 35 a\u00f1os que trabaja en las confecciones de prendas de vestir. El esposo de Evelia desde muy ni\u00f1o hab\u00eda seguido esa tradici\u00f3n familiar de confecciones, y cuando ellos se casaron, Evelia empez\u00f3 a ayudarle, poco a poco perfeccionando el arte hasta el d\u00eda de hoy, tiempo en el que realiza no solo confecciones sino tambi\u00e9n manualidades y lencer\u00eda. Trabajan solo los dos en un lugar de su vivienda donde tienen su taller y ofrecen una gran variedad de productos: ropa en general, pantalones, camisas, blusas para damas y ropa para ni\u00f1os. \nEvelia trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 10 de la noche. Sus clientes solicitan la prenda directamente en su taller, y despu\u00e9s ella empieza el ciclo de confecci\u00f3n, que dura aproximadamente una semana. Sus clientes var\u00edan entre vecinos, individuales, recomendados y empresas. Uno de sus desaf\u00edos en el trabajo es su insuficiente capital de trabajo para lograr r\u00e1pidamente sus metas. A veces, los clientes no cancelan a tiempo sus prendas, o no pagan el anticipo que ella exige, y le queda muy poco, para las compras de sus materias primas. Por eso, Evelia est\u00e1 aplicando a un pr\u00e9stamo de Kiva, para poder tener bastante capital para comprar telas, hilos, botones, pell\u00f3n, entretelas y m\u00e1s materiales para la producci\u00f3n de su ropa. Ella espera que con m\u00e1s capital, pueda ampliar su negocio, superar los altos costos  y tener una libertad financiera para adquirir su vivienda propia mas adelante tal como lo sue\u00f1a. \n","en":"Evelia, 68, has been working making clothes for 35 years.  Evelia\u2019s husband had been carrying out this same family tradition since he was a boy and when they got married Evelia started to help him and gradually perfected her art up to the present; in this time she\u2019s not only sewn clothes but she\u2019s also made crafts and lingerie.  The two of them work alone in a space set aside at home where they have their workshop and they offer a great variety of products: clothing in general, pants, shirts, blouses for women and children\u2019s clothes.\r\n\r\nEvelia works every day from 8am until 10pm.  Her customers request articles directly at her workshop and then she starts the production cycle that lasts approximately a week.  Her customers vary among neighbors, individuals, referrals and firms.  One of her work challenges is insufficient working capital to quickly reach her goals.  Sometimes customers don\u2019t pay for their clothes on time or don\u2019t pay the deposit she insists on so she\u2019s left with very little with which to purchase her raw materials.  \r\n\r\nThis is why Evelia\u2019s applying for a Kiva loan in order to have enough capital to buy fabric, thread, buttons, sheepskin, lining and other materials needed for making clothes.  She hopes that with more capital she will be able to expand the business, overcome high prices and have financial freedom to buy a house of her own later on just like she dreams about doing.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":826.11,"image":{"id":1209867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

For more than 15 years, Yohana and her family have been running a brick-production business.  It enables her to cover her family\u2019s living costs. In running the business, Yohana is assisted by her children. The process of making bricks includes: mixing materials, molding, drying and burning to become solid brick. Each month, Yohana is able to produce 3,000 solid bricks. \r\n\r\nRecently, Yohana dreamed of enlarging the business by selling agricultural products at the market and purchasing more materials such as sand, soil, fire wood and rice husks. Therefore she is requesting a loan of IDR 4,500,000 from TLM. Yohana really hopes that the loan will help her improve the business and better meet her family needs.
