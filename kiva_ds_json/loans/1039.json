When I was 10 years old, my parents, who are master silversmiths, told me to learn about making jewelry because someday, when I got older, I'd be able to make a living from this skill. I enjoyed creating new designs for my parents. I like drawing and I came up with a variety of jewelry designs. I even earned some money with this. I love this job! The nicest part of my jewelry is the uniqueness of its style. Although it shows an ethnic influence, it's different.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am new to Novica, and I'm really excited about creating more new designs. I'm really happy to receive the micro-credit, too, because this can help me replenish my stock and also \u2014 little by little \u2014 help me to develop new creations. I know it will work and, with time, my sales will increase. Thank you so much for your support, and for purchasing my jewelry. Please know that you are a part of the success I'm working toward.

Seven enthusiastic women, who are good friends and neighbors, are members of the Trust bank called \u201cMujeres Chimaltecas\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is 44-year-old Maria Josefina. She is married with four children. Her husband works in construction. The couple is really pleased that they have been able to send their children to school. Two of their children have completed high school while the other two are in 5th and 9th grade. They have high hopes for each of them.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Maria Josefina worked as a street vendor selling food. A few years ago, she took a real step up when she contacted the manager of a nearby clothing store in hopes that she could sell her food there. Now, Maria Josefina is thrilled to have 100 regular customers who she serves daily meals to from Monday through Friday. She rises early to prepare for each day\u2019s meals. Her hard work has paid off and she can count on a fixed monthly income. Her ultimate goal is to be self-sustaining and not in need of a loan.\r\n\r\nMaria Josefina, as well as the other women in her Trust Bank, appreciates the financial support that generous people from other countries give them. In addition, they are happy with the informative trainings that Friendship Bridge provides on relevant topics like budgeting, business management, customer service, women\u2019s health, self-esteem and children\u2019s rights. The combination of a loan and education enables these women to move forward, creating a better life for themselves, their families and their communities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1277569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cooking stuff ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-01-18T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-17T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":14300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-23T08:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2395.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347067551,"comment":null},{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2395.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355813610,"comment":null},{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2395.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364523701,"comment":null},{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2395,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924575,"comment":null},{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2395.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701750,"comment":null},{"amount":303.1,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2384.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564155,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T11:38:47Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:09:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":518101,"name":"El\u00edas Omar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El\u00edas tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero, vive junto a sus padres y un hermano de diez a\u00f1os. \u00c9l se ha dedicado a ayudar a su padre con las labores agr\u00edcolas; pero desde hace seis meses inicio a trabajar en la Fuerza Armada del pa\u00eds. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es  para comprar madera y lamina, para cambiarle el techo a la casa, ya que el que tiene esta da\u00f1ado y en el invierno se filtra el agua.

She separated from the father of her children, who are 25 and 18 years old and live with her in a house she built in a piece of land she inherited from her father.\r\n\r\nJuana cooks and sells food to go, like noodles, chaufa rice and fried chicken. She prepares everything in the morning and afternoon, and in the evening she opens her stall in the front of her house. Her customers are mainly neighbors and pedestrians. She has been doing this for more than twenty years, helped by her sister. In this way, Juana supports her with some daily income.\r\n\r\nJuana thinks she runs a profitable business, considering the profits and the acceptance among her customers. She enjoys this line of work because it helps her pay for her home expenses, and because she likes to cook, something she learned from her mother as a young girl. On the other hand, she feels very tired at the end of the day because she has to stay late in order to sell everything she prepares.\r\n\r\nHowever, she is conscious of the importance of the business as a source of income and wants to continue working. For this reason, she is planning to renew her kitchen utensils and her stall. This is her third loan with MFP, and she appreciates the loan she was granted. She would like to continue having this opportunity so she promises to pay in time, just as she has been doing with the previous loans. She feels comfortable working with her communal bank and she considers its members to be responsible and caring people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount, 1000 nuevos soles [PEN], she will buy wood to fix her stall, tables and chairs.

She is married to Ulpiano and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her income as she enlarge her business. \r\n\r\nDelia hopes that her business will grow and dreams that her children will have a good life.

Ron and his wife, Lori, became business partners in 2002. Today, Lori continues to run the business day to day. Lori employs her son, nephew and daughter, making their construction company a true family business. Lori says the best part of watching their business grow has been seeing customers seek them out because they have heard about the high standard of quality contracting the construction company offers.\r\n\r\nDespite their wonderful reviews and success via word of mouth, they have had trouble raising money from banks due to lack of collateral. Now that their local lumber yard has closed, Lori needs a loan to add a storage area to their shop as well as buy inventory. They hope to expand in the near future, deputizing their son and nephew to run the construction crews themselves while Ron and Lori run the office. A loan to this construction company will help them meet these goals and preserve the jobs and vitality of the entire

Suny, a second-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), is leading a female group member who also is a second-time borrower to take out a new loan in the amount of 160,000 KHR each. The group leader Suny states that via the help of the previous loan she was able to sufficiently cover the daily expenses and meet the family\u2019s needs. This time, she will spend her loan portion on building a latrine for use in her family.

is Emily, 48, a resident of Caloocan, Philippines. She is married to Jaime, a driver, and is a mother to their children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmily operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 15,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nEmily hopes that her business will grow and expand, and dreams to give her children a good and quality education.

Her loan request was rejected each time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is Khatuna\u2019s income working as a housekeeper. She makes 200 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family.

Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

Lkhagva, who is 43 years old, lives with his wife and children in Darkhan, which is the second largest city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Before moving to the house, they resided in a traditional Mongolian ger (portable felt dwelling) on another person's land. His elder daughter studies at the university of technology. His older son has graduated from his vocational course and now works as an electrician in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His younger daughter goes to high school while his youngest child attends kindergarten. Since 2006, he has begun rendering transportation services to local people using his own mini-van. In 2010, he purchased another mini-van and paid its' full price in January, 2011. In February, 2012 he rented another mini-van and employed one driver. His wife helps him by executing the role of money collector. This time of year, the price of automobiles is usually low compared with other seasons so he is requesting a loan of 6800000 MNT to purchase a car which runs on natural gas. The advantage of a car which runs on natural gas is that it emits less smoke and generates only harmless chemicals to atmosphere. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who is responsible and reliable. Purchasing a natural gas powered automobile is definitely reflective of his responsibility in all aspects."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":997.82,"image":{"id":1278880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

Her husband has been running his excavator renting business since 1998. From March to October, her husband rents his excavator to others. She herself has worked at a flour mill since 1980. In 1995 the flour mill stopped its operation so she lost her job. In 2008, she began working as a distribution manager at a private business entity and also works as a manager at a foreign language learning center. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years so she is requesting a loan of 6800000 MNT to renovate and insulate her house by purchasing necessary construction materials such as bricks, press board and cotton. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable and warm place. An insulated and renovated house doesn\u2019t lose heat thus reducing the consumption of coal.

She wants to start a bakery and a confectionery, but her loan request has always been rejected in the past because of her lack of experience, which is usually required by local credit providers. Nona has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Nona will start up her own confectionery shop. She will renovate the rented store, purchase stock and equipment for baking and bake different kinds of cakes and cookies.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDyrle is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages, to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nDyrle hopes to expand her business. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Por lo contrario, no le gusta cuando algunas veces no consigue vender todos sus productos en el tiempo establecido, sobre todo las verduras que perecen en poco d\u00edas ocasion\u00e1ndole perdida en su inversi\u00f3n, pero eso no la desanima y realiza mejor los c\u00e1lculos de sus ventas para comprar lo necesario y evitar que se descompongan.  Adem\u00e1s tiene planes de continuar y hacer crecer su negocio buscando incrementar sus ventas. Con el monto solicitado de 2000 nuevos soles, los invertir\u00e1 en la compra de pl\u00e1tanos, verduras y otros productos como arroz, huevos, aceites y az\u00facar.\n\n","en":"Ofelia is 56 years old, kind, hardworking and has a strong desire to get ahead.  She is married to Te\u00f3filo, with whom she has four children.  Te\u00f3filo works as a nursing technician.  She lives with her husband, three daughters and three grandchildren in her own home that she bought with her husband.\r\n\r\nOfelia\u2019s business is selling groceries.  She sells vegetables, plantains, eggs, bread, flour, rice, oil and sugar, among other things.  She operates her business from a stall built on the fa\u00e7ade of her home.  From here she waits on each one of her customers in a very kind and friendly manner.  Her daughter helps her with the business, which Ofelia has been running now for six years.  She considers her business a success because it has helped her out of her financial difficulties and has allowed her to help her husband with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it allows her to be in her home and look after her children and grandchildren.  On the other hand, she has not liked the few times that she has not been able to sell all of her products before they spoiled \u2013 especially vegetables that perish in a few days \u2013 causing her to lose her investment.  But this has not discouraged her, and instead she has more carefully calculated her sales so that she can buy only what is necessary and therefore avoid that any products go bad before being sold.\r\n\r\nOfelia plans to continue to grow her business by looking for ways to increase her sales.  With the requested amount of 2000 PEN, she will buy plantains, vegetables and other products such as rice, eggs, oil and sugar.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1279241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to

They live together in their own home located in a farming and livestock area. \r\n\r\nKety is a young mother with great determination and courage for work. 19 years ago she decided to dedicate herself to farming on the plots that her parents bestowed upon her. Now she also raises livestock, making the most of the good pastures of her settlement, thanks to the altitude.\r\n\r\n\"I have more than 50 rams, which I raise on high ground. When they are grown I sell them or I slaughter them\", she says. She earns a considerable income from the sale of the meat, the skin, the offal, and other things; she sells these at a makeshift stall at her district market. \r\n\r\nKety has high hopes, among these is to extend her farm land and improve the breed of her animals. For now she will work on raising more sheep, to continue her meat business. \r\n\r\nShe asks for your support in order to purchase 5 sheep, which she will fatten for their later sale. \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.

She is able to successfully sell these products in the wholesale market of Tarma.  \"These potatoes sell better, they command higher prices, and their prices are stable,\" she says.  \r\n\r\nFarming is not easy, even more so when the children are school-aged, and you must care for them before you go out to farm.  The months of January and February are important because of the rains; this is when she will start planting potatoes, which is the reason why she needs your support.  This will be her 5th loan with MFP.  She gives her word that she will make her monthly payments on time.  Norma belongs to the communal bank \"Mirando un futuro mejor,\" and she feels comfortable with the institution's system of internal accounting and the educational talks it provides. \r\n\r\nNorma will use the 1,000 Peruvian soles she requests to buy sacks of organic fertilizer for the potatoes that she will plant this month.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1279425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Shota will start his own bakery. He will bake traditional Georgian bread and sell it for a good price. He owns a commercial space and he hopes his project will be profitable as he already has the baking experience and will offer quality products to his customers. This will increase his sales volume. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1004.14,"image":{"id":1279194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to

She began the business following her husband's retirement six years ago because it was not easy to maintain their home. She worked assisting friends until she gathered enough capital to open her own business. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,500,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan of SLL4, 000,000 in order to buy 100 crates of soft drinks.
