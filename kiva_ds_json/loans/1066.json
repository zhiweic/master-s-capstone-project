They have scarce economic resources. His children have had to emigrate abroad and until the present, Juan knows little about them. Left in charge of his grandchildren, Juan works exclusively in agriculture. In his free time, he works as a day laborer in different parcels in his community, in order to bring in more pesos for his family.\r\n \r\nDuring the last harvest, there were climate problems -- a drought -- and recently there has been a shortage of water for irrigation. As a result, his parcels of onions, potatoes, and beans have suffered reduced production. The harvest has been minimal, resulting in a collapse of income for a family that depends on agricultural production each year, principally on onions, potatoes, and beans.\r\n\r\nJuan is a much loved and respected person in his community, due to his dedication in pursuing his agricultural labors, on which he depends to advance his family. He is soliciting a loan to buy organic fertilizer and, in this manner, to improve his crop's production. Juan cultivates small parcels with his wife. He believes this loan will improve the condition of his crops and, also, his family's conditions of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300.06,"image":{"id":1285366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase organic fertilizer for his crops, in order to recover from a drought.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-31T08:00:24Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300.06,"local_amount":2000.42,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2073.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390952959,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-04T16:03:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":522262,"name":"Rodolfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rodolfo tiene 33 a\u00f1os de edad y naci\u00f3  en la ciudad del Cusco, \u00e9l tiene una relaci\u00f3n  de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene dos hijos, \u00e9l pertenece al banco comunal \u201cNaupasunchis\u201d de la ciudad del Cusco.

He had enjoyed stable finances, but due to his daughter's health problems (an illness inherited from her ancestors: third level epilepsy), don Cirilo has had to bring her to specialized hospital centers that can treat his daughter and reduce the frequency of her epileptic attacks.  Because of the scarce rainfall during the previous agricultural cycle, the subterranean water level in the area has been reduced.   As such, don Cirilo has lost a great quantity of his tomato plants.  The community has restricted water usage to a minimum, which hasn't been sufficient for his crops.  This has caused don Cirilo a loss of income, being unable to selling his products.  For these reasons, his financial stability has suffered an imbalance which has directly affected his ability to acquire the materials and supplies he needs for production, like being unable to buy food for the laborers that he employs.  In order to remedy all of the above, don Cirilo is turning to a loan request.  His goal is to improve his quality of life and to return to the path of prosperity.  He wants to buy oxen to help with the plowing.  He also mentions year after year water quantities have diminished as a result of climate change (global warming).

She is married and the mother of four children, who are 11, 15, 18 and 20 years of age respectively. She is a merchant, the owner of a small store. She started in commerce 22 years ago, because she saw that there were no stores near where she was living. Thus she got the idea to open her own business, which she saw was going to generate a better income since there was no competition. This has been her first business and she relies on the support of her husband. She sells her products from her home and depends on other income, such as the money that her husband gives her. \n\nNowadays Eddi wants to invest in her store in order to be able to offer her customers a more varied inventory and obtain more income. The new school season is approaching and this is the reason that Eddi is requesting the funding to purchase school supplies, such as notebooks, pencils, rulers, erasers, colored pencils, etc. These are all necessary supplies that she still does not have. She estimates that this loan will be a help because she will be able to stock her business to attract more customers. In this way she will increase her sales and generate more earnings. One of her next goals is to pay off this loan so that she will then be able to return to request another one.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1293974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase
