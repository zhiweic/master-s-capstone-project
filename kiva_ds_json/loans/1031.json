She always tries to realize her plans and to receive their benefits. She is married and is raising two young children. Her husband does not provide for the family and therefore Firuza is the main breadwinner in the family. For more than 15 years, she has been engaged in growing crops and vegetables, and viticulture. The last time she did not get the intended crop and could not earn enough money to live, and therefore difficult living conditions force her to work more and more. \r\n\r\nThe only way to generate additional income and to improve living conditions is to create a new business, says Firuza. To that end, she took a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate. \r\n\r\nNow, she can fully organize a business and become successful in this area. She wants to organize a business buying and selling livestock, since she lives in a rural area and has good conditions for livestock.

Unfortunately, Carlos had to start working at an early age to help his parents, and was unable to pursue a career, but he would have liked very much to do so. In his spare time, he likes to listen to music and sometimes his wife cooks a delicious arroz con pollo to pamper him, as this is his favorite food.\r\n\r\nOf his own initiative, with a lot of effort and dedication, Carlos works every day as a driver for a hardware store in their city. He transports building materials on a truck to different areas. Carlos can work for about 12 hours; he feels comfortable doing the work and believes that he does well because of his responsibility and good performance.\r\n\r\nCarlos is very grateful to Kiva lenders, and thanks to their assistance, may cover medical expenses, transportation and hospitalization of his mother, as she is in very delicate health and needs to be taken to a medical center in the capital to treat her painful illness. Carlos will continue to work and strive to achieve his dream of completing the construction of their home, in order to provide greater security and wellness for himself and his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1269876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

She works as a decorator at a private company. Her husband earns income by using his truck to transport goods. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. The house they live in needs some home appliances. Also, the truck her husband uses has deteriorated over the years and needs some repair. As winter comes to Mongolia, the house gets cold and the family is in need of some heating source. So she is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase an LCD television, carpet, coal and some equipment for truck repair. As a result, the family can improve their living environment, as well as repair their income-generating truck.

She is married and lives with her husband in the capital city of Georgia. Maia\u2019s husband works as an elevator technician and gets a monthly salary. Maia\u2019s economic activity is a newly started business. In particular, a small store where tobaccos, beverages and different kinds of snacks are sold.  Maia requested loan from local financial institutions for the business expansion, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected, because of low income and insufficient experience in her business.\r\n\r\nMaia was involved in the same type of business during three years and worked as a saleslady, but the owner decided to stop the business because of financial problems. Maia started her own business, as the project was profitable. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's  rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Maia will enlarge and develop her store.

Several months ago, Levan decided to expand his business to supplement his income, but his loan requests have been rejected several times by local financial institutions. He lacks experience with new business start-ups and does not qualify for a traditional loan under income requirements. \r\n\r\nLevan is requesting a loan under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This loan program provides start-up and restart-up loans with reduced requirements for the rural poor who do not have access to many credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers.\" Levan will use his loan to go to Germany himself and purchase two cars to resell for a profit.

He currently lives with his wife, his daughter and her husband, and one grandson.  They all contribute toward the household expenses.\r\n\r\nJose sells cold carbonated soft drinks of different brands and flavors.  He also sells various types of snacks.  To do this he has a small shop that he set up in his home.  Having seen his neighbors\u2019 and transients\u2019 needs, he looked for a way to generate an income, so he opened this shop where his wife happily serves customers.\r\n\r\nHe also provides transportation services with his car.\r\n\r\nHe began his selling business more than a year ago, became known among his neighbors, and won regular customers. \r\n\r\nHe considers his business to be profitable because he has steady customers who always buy from him.\r\n\r\nHe likes what he does because it lets him count on an income and also leaves him time to do transportation, which generates other income with which he supports his wife and other household expenses.  Therefore he plans to increase his stock of products and diversify so he can welcome more customers.  This will be his sixth loan through MFP and he is very happy to know that he will have financial backing and feels more comfortable advancing with his work. He also promises to be on time with his payments as with previous loans.  He is also happy to be part of his communal bank because all the members are responsible and united.\r\n\r\nHe will use the 2,000 PEN from this loan to buy carbonated drinks and snacks.  He is looking for volume prices so he can be more competitive in prices and have better sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1269780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to stock his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":294.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":318.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":330.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":332.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":355.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":367.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.71},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.71,"local_amount":294.27,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":300.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573178,"comment":null},{"amount":127.52,"local_amount":318.81,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":325.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122820,"comment":null},{"amount":132.28,"local_amount":330.7,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":337.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868643,"comment":null},{"amount":133.2,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":339.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577477,"comment":null},{"amount":142.18,"local_amount":355.45,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":362.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529714,"comment":null},{"amount":147.11,"local_amount":367.78,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":374.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974745,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T19:30:02Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":514073,"name":"Veronica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronica is 37 years old.

Ica with her parents and siblings.  She's a very friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic young woman with a big desire for self-improvement.  Unfortunately, because she lacks financial resources and needs to work, Soledad hasn't been able to study to be a nurse as she would like, but she would very much like to do so.  In her free time she likes to watch movies, and sometimes she cooks a delicious ceviche to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with great effort and dedication, Soledad works every day as a domestic employee.  She cleans, cooks, washes clothes, and does other tasks.

One source of income is his monthly salary working as a watchman, additionally he is provided with a retirement pension. \r\n\r\nGogia is requesting a loan from Credo to start-up his family business. He will use his loan to purchase piglets to start an animal husbandry business. He will put the piglets in a shed in the yard and raise and sell them for a higher price. Gogia's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

is 32 years old, married, and lives in Batumi with his wife and three children. The source of the family income is the monthly salary earned by Mamuka\u2019s wife working at a non-governmental organization. Mamuka has requested a loan from the local financial institutions for starting up a business but his loan requests have been rejected several times because he lacks experience with new business start-ups and does not qualify for a traditional loan under income requirements. Mamuka is requesting a loan under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

There she earns income by selling merchandise in a general store or business located in her own house. Her main products are clothing, shoes, cosmetics, and stationery, which she sells on a cash basis to customers from the neighborhood and surrounding areas every day starting at 9 in the morning and ending at 9 in the evening or later, if necessary. The idea of selling merchandise initially came to Sandra 8 years ago, and because of this she chose to join up with a multinational company to sell its products through catalogues or specialized product guides. Little by little she bought display cases with her earnings, and then her own premises, in which she can still be found and from which she distributes her products in cash to the end customer who buys it at retail. Lately she has been offering communication services by the minute, which generates new income. In this way she makes the most of her land line customers with the goal of boosting both businesses. Her goal is to achieve a wide variety of products and find a new place of business or branch with this same concept. Her capacity to buy in order to satisfy the growing demand is getting smaller and smaller, but her desire to grow is persistent.

She's a married woman who has five children, ages 19 to 32, and makes a living selling merchandise in a shop and selling chicken and cold cuts.\r\n\r\nHer experience as a merchant dates back five years, when she began selling cosmetics through specialized product catalogues in 2007.  Little by little she bought display cabinets to fix up her point of contact with her customers.  Here they found many of the articles they needed, such as clothing, women's accessories, and general jewelry.  This way she increased her clientele and later added sales of chicken and cold cuts, making the most of the customers she had acquired during this period.\r\n\r\nShe makes sales in cash and, among her better customers, on credit.  She works Monday through Sunday from 8 in the morning until 10 at night, with the goal of getting more well-being in her household all the time.  Her commercial business is located in her house, and all the people around her know her, so she has more buyers all the time.\r\n\r\nThis is why she's requesting a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She'll buy cosmetics, chicken, meat, etc.\r\n\r\nWith this investment, little by little she'll earn a new market and increase her investments again, especially in the Christmas season, when an increase in sales is normal every year.

is a 35-year-old married man with four children living in Bundibugyo, Uganda. Seven years ago, he decided to venture into motorcycle transport to help meet the family's needs, given its low cost of operation.

The women themselves chose this name for the group because the area where they live has some of the best sand you can ever find.  One member of the group, Isabel, tells us that she is 32 years old and has been married to Abranm, a trader, for 32 years.  Together, they had a family but now their children are independent.  Isabel has always lived in the same community and for 20 years she has been selling household products.  She started this because as a child she always saw her parents and neighbours that would sell at the markets and then, when she married, she wanted to help her husband with the household bills.  Her daughters studied and she wanted the best for them.  Isabel is applying for a loan in order to buy more merchandise, such as strainers, blender cups, items for pressure cookers, spoons, cloths and floor cloths.  Isabel is very happy because, thanks to the loan from Kiva and Vision Found, she will be able to buy everything she needs.  She says that she has always walked the streets to sell her products.  She thinks that she does not have any difficulties because she is reliable in what she does in case they stop her from selling in peace.  Perhaps her sales are low though she says:  \"One day I would like to have my own place where we could sell our products.  I think our profits would increase so much because customers would know where to find us much more easily and we would sell more\".  All the members of the group also have dreams and so they are all applying for a loan.  Zenaida will use hers to buy novelty items; Rosa will buy blender cups and household products; Veronica will invest in items for Christmas; Gloria will buy socks and blender cups; Rosa Ma will buy fibres and household products; and, finally, Alicia will buy for her grocery store.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

who is photographed next to his taxi, is a 34-year-old married man and a father of two sons and two daughters. Osama lives a modest life with his family in the Jabalia area located in Gaza City. He is employed, but earns a low salary which is not enough to cover all of his costs and provide for his family's needs.\r\n\r\nOsama has also been a taxi driver for the past three months. He wants to have his own taxi in order to work on his own project. It is a step to increase his income and provide his family with better living conditions.\r\n\r\nOsama is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to purchase his own taxi. This will help Osama to feel free to work extra hours and take more internal and external requests, which will lead to an increase in his income and better living conditions for his family.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The location is known for its beautiful beaches so often visited by many national and foreign tourists. San Clemente offers diverse beautiful spots and rich and varied local and regional dishes.\r\n\r\nMaria, who lives here, is 53 years old, married, and the fruit of this union is 4 children, all of whom are now adult and independent. Her husband no longer works due to poor health.\r\n\r\nMaria, upon seeing that her husband could no longer work, used the savings she had to open a small general store in her own home. She and her husband attend it every day, though they recognize that the days when they sell the most are the weekends, days when many tourists arrive to this beautiful resort area. Here they sell a little of everything, from clothing and shoes to ice cream, sodas, ice, and many other products that her customers need. The business is now 5 years old and it is now the only source of income they have for getting ahead.\r\n\r\nMaria is again requesting a loan from Kiva because these loans help her greatly. With the earnings from this loan cycle, she can purchase a glass case that will serve to exhibit her merchandise, facilitating sales, since customers from outside her house will see what they like and enter to buy. \r\n\r\nConcerning repayment, she has always been reliable. This loan will be used to restock the general store, purchasing clothing, shoes, wallets, etc. Maria has been a member of her communal bank for more than 14 years and she likes it for the benefits the institution offers. Maria's goals are to continue ahead in her business and to enjoy good health.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1166133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

She works at this about 5 hours a day and can have up to 25 customers a day.  She believes that her work is going well because she is friendly to her customers and above all, she is responsible and very hard-working. \r\n\r\nEdith is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to the great support they have offered her, she will be able to purchase a new tricycle since the one she currently has is very old and breaks down constantly.  In this way, she will be able to improve her income and have the necessary tools to be able to work and continue striving to make her great dream come true: \"to give her children a good education and to improve her home.\" "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1270642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to

She lives together with her husband, two of her children, and one grandchild--all of whom she loves very much--in the home she purchased with the help of her husband. Ybette works selling staple grocery items from a storefront installed in their home. She sells fresh fruits by getting up early and heading to the local markets where she buys the freshest fruits from the vendors and brings them back to her store to sell to her customers, who for the most part are her own neighbors. She has been running her business for three years, during which time she has attended to her customers in a kind and cordial manner, thereby winning their business. At present, she runs this business all by herself.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be quite successful given the strong demand she has for her products and the income it brings her. She likes her business because it allows her to be at home, allows her to be around her children so she can care for them, and provides her with an occupation that generates an income. This allows her to help her husband with their home expenses and the education of their children. Seeing the good results she has had with her business, she has plans to continue and to expand, acquiring more merchandise to stock her store. Thus, she is applying for her third loan through the institution, MFP. She is grateful that she can count on the financial assistance to continue with her goals. She promises to make timely payments so that she can maintain a strong credit history and be able to secure more loans in the future. She also comments that she is happy with her communal bank; she knows the other members and considers them to be good people. \r\n\r\nWith the amount of 800 nuevos soles requested, she will invest in more merchandise to stock her store: primary staples such as rice, canned goods, noodles, and other foodstuffs.

In her free time she enjoys reading and on occasion she cooks a delicious Seco de Res (made from beef) that she shares with her family. \r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with a lot of tenacity and dedication, Fredesvinda works in her little store selling vegetables. She works every day from the early morning hours and works for up to 10 hours. She enjoys her work and believes that everything is going well for her because of her hard work and because of the friendly attention she gives her customers. \r\n\r\nFredesvinda is very appreciative to the lenders at Kiva because the help that they give that will enable her to purchase a larger quantity of vegetables, pumpkin, cheese and other items. In this way, Fredesvinda will have a better stocked store and will be able to attend to a larger number of customers. In this way she will be able to continue working and striving to achieve her dream of being a large producer and selling vegetables. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1270663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"purchase vegetables for re-sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-01-06T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-05T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredesvinda Elisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":166.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":172.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":187.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":186.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":196.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":201.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":211.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":217.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":226.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":235.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":244.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":253.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.5,"local_amount":166.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339479077,"comment":null},{"amount":69.08,"local_amount":172.69,"processed_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":176.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031748,"comment":null},{"amount":75.07,"local_amount":187.68,"processed_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":191.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776236,"comment":null},{"amount":74.68,"local_amount":186.7,"processed_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":190.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483052,"comment":null},{"amount":78.5,"local_amount":196.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":200.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889096,"comment":null},{"amount":80.64,"local_amount":201.6,"processed_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":205.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664012,"comment":null},{"amount":84.49,"local_amount":211.21,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:16Z","rounded_local_amount":215.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775053,"comment":null},{"amount":87.06,"local_amount":217.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":222.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778787,"comment":null},{"amount":383.98,"local_amount":959.96,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":979.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054016,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T19:36:44Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:14:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":514338,"name":"Miguel Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miguel e sun joven de 20 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la ciudad de Chincha, la cual se caracteriza por tener un clima muy calido y acogedor, asimismo sus pobladores son personas muy alegres y sobre todo muy generosas y amables.

the Guadalupe district, with his wife and their two small children, whom they love above all else. He is a very nice, hard-working, and enthusiastic person, who spares no effort to try to improve his family's lot in life. Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources that made it necessary for him to start working, Marcial was not able to study mechanical engineering, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to watch television and sometimes cooks delicious pasta to share with his family. Marcial, with lots of effort and dedication, started his own business selling emollients. On week-ends, he works as a mototaxi driver. He starts work early every morning and works about eight hours a day. He is happy with his work and attributes his success to his experience and his amiable manner towards customers. Marcial is very grateful to Kiva lenders, since, thanks to their help, he will be able to buy his own mototaxi, to replace the one he currently rents. Owning this vehicle  will be the first step towards making his dream of having his own transportation business become reality."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1270887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy a mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"GUADALUPE","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-01-06T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-05T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcial","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":74.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":78.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":80.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":84.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":95.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":98.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":103.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.31},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.16,"local_amount":62.91,"processed_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":64.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339479088,"comment":null},{"amount":27.31,"local_amount":68.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":69.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031759,"comment":null},{"amount":29.87,"local_amount":74.69,"processed_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":76.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776247,"comment":null},{"amount":29.7,"local_amount":74.24,"processed_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":75.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483063,"comment":null},{"amount":31.33,"local_amount":78.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":79.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889108,"comment":null},{"amount":32.25,"local_amount":80.61,"processed_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":82.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664023,"comment":null},{"amount":33.9,"local_amount":84.75,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775073,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":87.52,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778798,"comment":null},{"amount":155.48,"local_amount":388.69,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":396.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054022,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T21:04:30Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:14:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":514430,"name":"Cesar Augusto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cesar de 47 a\u00f1os de edad, es padre de cuatro hijos, por los cuales se esmera d\u00eda a d\u00eda para ofrecerles una buena educaci\u00f3n.
