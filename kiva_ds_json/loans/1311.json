He began his business because after completing his secondary school, his father could not pay for his collage, so he decided to run a business.

She and her husband are raising two children.  She has a secondary education and is involved in agriculture, an activity which constitutes her family's main source of income.  She essentially grows vegetables, which she started doing 16 years ago with an initial capital of 5,000 som.  Thanks to Gulmira's hard work, her farm now consists of 0.24 hectares of land and she cultivates early cucumbers, onions and potatoes on a yearly basis, for the family's consumption as well as for resale.\r\n\r\nGulmira takes care of her farm practically by herself.  Her husband is a private builder who works on construction sites during the building season and helps his wife with the farm-work during the off-season.  Gulmira makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan to buy cucumber and tomato seeds, as well as fertilizers and pesticides.  With the earnings from her loan Gulmira plans to improve her family's financial situation and, ultimately, their living conditions.  In the future, she and her husband would like to build a greenhouse on their

They will use their loans investing in their businesses, which mostly involve textile production.\r\n\r\nMaria is the 23-year-old Secretary of the Trust Bank. Her fellow Trust Bank members chose her to occupy this position as she has had six years of education and has good Spanish reading and writing skills. Maria is the youngest member of the Trust Bank! She is a weaver and has requested a new loan which she will use to purchase various types of thread to produce more textiles. She will also use a small portion of the loan for her husband\u2019s business. He sells cellphone accessories and parts. The couple works very hard each day so that they can meet the basic needs of their family including providing nutritious foods and education.\r\n\r\nMaria, along with the other ladies in the Trust Bank, really appreciated the opportunities realized during their first loan cycle, and they are quite excited about this second loan cycle. Besides receiving and making payments on their loans, the women participate in monthly trainings on various topics like effective business administration, health and nutrition, and self-esteem. This month\u2019s topic involves budgeting administration.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank are so thankful to Kiva investors throughout the world who are helping them move ahead in their lives. They look forward to a brighter future as empowered women, creating better lives for themselves, their families, and their community of Chichicastenango.

With the goal of expanding her farm, Gulsaana asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a horse to increase her livestock numbers. She plans to use the profits to purchase additional domestic animals.

Most of the populations of this rural area work in agriculture as well as textile and handicraft production. One of the communities located in Quiche is \u201cCruzche\u201d meaning \u201ctree cross\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cCruzche III\u201d was formed in 2012 and consists of thirteen hard-working and determined women. The ladies are applying for a new loan with Friendship Bridge in order to sustain and grow their businesses. They are very motivated to succeed and look forward to their monthly meetings where they also receive trainings on subjects like effective business practices, indebtedness, women\u2019s health, children\u2019s nutrition and self-esteem. Almost all of them have had very little or no formal education.\r\n\r\nFermina is the 36-year-old Secretary of the Trust Bank. She is married and has five children. As three of the children are still dependent on Fermina and her husband, the couple makes many sacrifices so that they can meet the basic needs of the children. They realize that education is a vital key to their successful futures and so the couple works hard. Fermina fabricates palm mats and delivers 50 each week to the local market. She is requesting a new loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to invest in additional palm material for the mats as well as other materials. Fermina wants to take advantage of this time of the year to buy quantities of raw materials because this is the most economical time to make purchases as costs are down.\r\n\r\nEach of the ladies in the Trust Bank is most grateful to Kiva investors and Friendship Bridge for this vital support which is really a lifeline for them. With these loans, the women can maintain or grow their businesses. With the monthly trainings, they can arm themselves with new knowledge to live their lives. The combination of loans and education is a winning one for the ladies of the Cruzche Trust Bank. They are able to step more confidently and empowered into a brighter future and create a better life for themselves, their families and their community.

En la actualidad lucha para brindarles  a sus hijos un futuro mejor.\nGracias a  su esfuerzo y sus ganas de salir adelante tiene por actividad econ\u00f3mica el servicio de fritanga en sus casas de habitaci\u00f3n. Una fritanga es una peque\u00f1a venta de comida t\u00edpica casera como gallo pinto, tacos, maduros, carne asada, pollo asados, tajadas, enchiladas. Ella dedica a su negocio unas 12 horas diarias ofreciendo su producto. El objetivo del cr\u00e9dito es invertir en capital de trabajo y surtir su negocio en la compra de materia prima para elaborar la comida o fritanga, para que en un futuro no muy lejano pueda obtener mejores ingresos.\n","en":"Ari Yesenia is 33 years old and the single mother of three minor children under her care.

He is a farmer too and has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables in his own land. \r\n\r\nElcin is responsible for the living expenses of three members of his family. For this reason, he works hard and puts substantial effort into continuing to improve his business. In April 2012, he opened his current shop and is working hard to develop it.

Her husband works in the United States in order to give a better future to their four children. The eldest is 20 and finished high school, the daughter is sixteen and finishing high school, and the youngest two are twins who go to primary school. Norma grows coffee and has been doing so for many years, which means she knows everything about caring for the plants, harvesting the crops, using manure and fertilisers, etc. She owns a plot of land, a small part of which she inherited from her parents, the rest of which she acquired thanks to her own labour. She sells her coffee to middlemen who come to her village to buy it. Her land is 30 minutes away from her house on foot, 10 minutes by car. When the time for harvesting comes, her whole family helps, in order to reduce costs and increase profits. Norma's main goal is to double her production in order to be more stable financially, so as to support her children during their studies and pay for household expenses, which would mean her husband would not need to work abroad any more. Her greatest wish is to see her family living under the same roof again. She asks for a loan in order to care for her crops: she needs to buy fertiliser and manure, and wants to hire farm hands in order to increase her production and, thus, her income, so as to reach her goals and fulfill her dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1496553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies and to hire farm hands to help her harvest her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T11:00:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T15:30:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":660244,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer is married to a farmer who owns a banana farm in their village.

She is married to Bobby, an electrician, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nAnita dreams that her business will grow bigger and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

Izzat has been working with Arvand for several years now, receiving loans to help grow her business.  She is involved in agriculture.  Next to her home she has a plot of land on which she grows wheat, which she then sells to make her income.  In the future, she would like to start raising livestock so she can sell their meat and milk, but at the moment she needs to buy seeds to sow her wheat.  This is why she has turned to Arvand to receive a loan to buy these seeds.

She earns a minimum of Php 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. \r\n\r\nMerenciana dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes the family will have their own house and lot.

Along with her expertise, Raquel offers multiple resources to drivers in need of road laws in and outside of Texas, obtaining and understanding police reports, and the like.\r\n\r\nAs Raquel calls it, ineedawitness.com is the first business that allows people to find each other in order to solve a claim. Though the main focus of the site is to help find people who witnessed car accidents, one may also help find someone who owes them child support, find the owner of a vehicle, and other personal assets.\r\n\r\nWith a wide range of people she can service, Raquel sets herself up for a large target audience, and pretty much, a flawless business. The philosophy behind Raquel\u2019s business is to help \u201cpeople recover from an unfortunate event.\u201d She sees her business as one with extreme potential growth, and plans to expand her business as it ages.\r\n\r\nA previous insurance agent with more than 25 years of experience, Raquel knows the industry and understands client\u2019s frustration when they become victims of an accident, vandalism, or any other incident where witnesses are unavailable to give their statement.

responsible young man. He is married and has children. He lives with his family in a small village. However the house in which they live is a little too small and not entirely well planned for good living. David's wife is a housewife. She is very hardworking and caring mother. David works as a carpenter in his village. He receives a good pay from his work. This income is sufficient for covering living expenses. \r\n\r\nHowever David has a dream; he would like to build a new house for his family. To do this he needs money and what he earns is not sufficient to afford building a new house. His father, who works in Russia as a builder, helps him through sending money every month. In addition, David turned to Arvand and would like to receive a loan to purchase building materials to build the house. He hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the help."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Pecha says, she and her husband have to work very hard to sustain the family and to send their children to school to get an education like other children. With the loan amount she wishes to expand and refill the shop. She thanks WSDS for being so gracious to her, and she believes that her burden will be much lighter now. Like her the rest of the group are engaged in sand sheaving, weaving and tending shop.

Nuki is a housewife and has two children. Her 9-year-old daughter is going to elementary school and her second daughter is an 8-month-old baby girl. \r\n\r\nThey live in the family home in Cibubur, a suburban area located about 30 minutes from Jakarta. Nuki's husband is an employee in a private company. To help her husband cover her family's needs, Nuki runs a small stall which sells mobile phone airtime credits, and she services bill payments for her customers. \r\n\r\nNuki joined Ruma because she wants to improve her business. She is glad that her business is being assisted and supported by Ruma agents. For the last three months, she has got around $15-$16 per day in sales on average, just from selling mobile phone airtime credits.

Kulushay has a high school education and her outlook on life is optimistic.  She knows exactly what she wants and she goes after it with all her strength.  She knows how to use and budget money to reach her goals.  \r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for her family, Kulushay works raising livestock.  She started this business 23 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, she now has two dairy cows, three calves and 14 sheep.  She has everything she needs to keep the animals, including a barn and a pasture for roaming.  Her dairy cows spend all year on the farm and Kulushay looks after them herself, and the sheep are tended by a shepherd from March to October while they roam in the pasture.  She has enough hay and feed to provide for the animals.  Her monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of developing her business further, Kulushay has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy calves so she can increase her head of livestock.  She plans to use the money from the loan to further increase her head of livestock, as well as to save up money to finish some building work in progress on her home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1496193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a heifer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chech-Dobo village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T14:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T14:40:15Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kulushay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2704},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2782},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2864},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2947},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3033},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3122},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3213},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3306},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3402}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-25T11:13:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":649085,"name":"Karkyra","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u044b\u0440\u0435 31 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u044b\u0440\u044b -

Her profits from her business will definitely help her sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial gain with happiness and gratitude in her heart. \r\n\r\nSonia dreams of being successful in her business and hopes that her family will always be in good health. Every week she meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of work and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.67,"image":{"id":1444664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for raw ingredients, such as rice, pork, chicken, vegetables, and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4666.66,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:20:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4746.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701612,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T21:05:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":649606,"name":"Guillerma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Guillerma is 62 years old and married with eleven children.
