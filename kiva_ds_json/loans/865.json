He will buy in volume and pay cash which will lead to more price competitiveness because of the discounts his suppliers will give him this season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1101200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay cash for merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-29T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-28T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicolas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78779},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82329},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84250},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86215},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88227},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":90286},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":92392},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94548},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96754},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99012},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101322},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":105886}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.97},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.57},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":78779,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":81867.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101224,"comment":null},{"amount":46.78,"local_amount":82329,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":85556.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395396,"comment":null},{"amount":213.38,"local_amount":375557,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":390280.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071107,"comment":null},{"amount":320.08,"local_amount":563335,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":585420.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381706039,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-28T15:01:38Z","paid_date":"2013-07-22T08:39:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":428707,"name":"Piedra Ancha Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo se llama Piedra Ancha esta conformado por ocho mujeres trabajadoras y humildes originarias de un peque\u00f1o pueblo llamado Piedra Ancha.

He initiated the business in 2006. Although he has a disability, he tries his best to fulfill his family's needs.  He is working hard to send his children to school.  Paulus usually receives orders to sew clothes and in addition he also receives orders to repair sofas.  \r\n\r\nRecently, Paulus needed a big amount of capital for the business as he received orders to sew clothes and to repair a sofa.  He requested a loan from TLM amounting to 5,000,000 Rupiah (IDR).  The loan is to be spent on business materials, sewing thread, packing needle, sofa wrapping material, and sofa repairing equipment.  He hopes that he can generate more income to enable him to send the children to university in the future.

agobiantes y sin tiempo para dedicarse a sus hijos, quienes requer\u00edan una mayor atenci\u00f3n, decidi\u00f3 renunciar de su empleo y emprender su propia aventura de negocios,   aprovechando su  experiencia pasada en el mercado. Fue as\u00ed como apoyada por un proveedor empez\u00f3 a vender calzado, bolsos y ropa a cr\u00e9dito y as\u00ed mismo en plazos de 3 meses, pagaba a su proveedor, quien fue su primer apoyo en esta decisi\u00f3n. Gradualmente su clientela fue creciendo y sus opciones de compra se incrementaron, logrando ensanchar su lista de proveedores como hoy, que cuenta con estos en otras  ciudades del pa\u00eds como  Barranquilla y Bucaramanga.    Su meta es disponer de un capital de trabajo suficiente, para ella misma hacer compras de productos de oportunidad, que brinda el mercado   en estas ciudades, cuando hay dinero disponible. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es lograr que ante la creciente demanda de su mercado,  tenga un capital de trabajo suficiente para responderle oportunamente a su clientela. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante la cual comprara directamente calzado y bolsos elaborados en cuero y que est\u00e1n justificados en pedidos de sus clientes rentables, lo cual hace que esta financiaci\u00f3n tenga un gran potencial de \u00e9xito. ","en":"The story of Monica's business started when she was working in a shoe store, where she worked for many years. She worked long exhausting days, and didn't have time to dedicate to her children, who require greater attention. She decided to resign from her job and start her own business venture, using the experience she gained in her job. And so it went, with the support of a supplier, she started selling shoes, purses and clothing on credit, and every three months made payments to her provider. The provider was the first support she had in her decision to start her own business. Gradually her customer base grew and the options she had for where to purchase her goods also increased, so that her list of suppliers expanded to include others in different \r\ncities of the country, like Barranquilla y Bucaramanga. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to have available working cash, so she can buy products when there is an opportunity in the market in these cities. Her biggest challenge is meeting the growing demand of the market, and having enough money on hand to respond to the demands of her clients, allowing her to take advantage of the potential profit. This is the reason she has requested a Kiva loan, which will be the first loan she has taken out through the 'Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo'. She will use the money to purchase shoes and purses made of leather, which have already been pre-ordered by her customers, which means that this loan has great potential for success.

is a prospective student applying for a loan to start his undergraduate work on a Bachelor of Law at Strathmore University and this is his story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Peter. I come from a family of four. I have one older sister and two younger brothers. My sister has just completed her second year at university. My younger brother will be beginning at high school next year, while the last-born has just begun middle school. My father is a chemist. My mother is a nurse at a government hospital.\r\n\r\nI believe in quality education. Having worked hard and attaining a position at one of the top schools in Kenya, I want to continue my pursuit for quality education at Strathmore University, a prestigious university in Nairobi, Kenya with a reputation for its excellence. I attained admission to Strathmore University to join the pioneer Law class at its recently opened Strathmore Law School. The course begins on 25th June 2012. \r\n\r\nI would require the loan so as to pay for my tuition costs. As the university gives the highest quality education in the country thus its tuition fees are also expensive. All my siblings require a lot of financial support from my parents who are average income earners which makes it hard for them to manage providing for all our education needs.  This has made me fear for my future, thus making me think of ways of completing my studies and attaining my dreams and ambition of becoming a top lawyer in the country.\r\n\r\nThis loan will enable me to focus on my studies as it will give me assurance that I will complete my course without any financial setbacks and will give me peace to focus on my class work and achieve my goals in life. \r\n\r\nI am an easy-going person who is easy to talk to. I do not anger quickly but instead listen to the whole story before I react. I am very social as I do not shy away from conversation. Also ambitious, I am quite the go-getter; once I have my eyes set on something, very little can be done to stop me. \r\n\r\nUpon graduation, I intend to venture into public service to provide legal assistance to the needy in society. I also plan to venture into policy making so as to make an impact not only in society but also the world.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":17650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":17650,"image":{"id":1105237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

With it she will buy an industrial machine with which she will increase her production of cleaning cloths and so have more profitability.  In addition, she will invest in perfume orders and in cosmetics.\r\n\r\nWe are certain of the success of her Kiva loan because she is supported by her mother, who knows the industrial cleaning cloth market and is the one who is driving her.

children. In 1990, in search of a source of income for her family, Mukhabat began her own business selling women's knitted wear at the market with an initial 10,000 som (KGS) investment.

Starting in the year 2000 Gulmira worked in a financial company where she earned a low salary. Following her divorce with her husband, after which she was the sole provider for her children, Gulmira decided to travel to Russia to find work but because of health problems she returned. In 2009 in search of a source of income for her family she used an initial investment of 17,000 som (KGS) to start her own business selling consumer goods at market.Thanks to her persistence and hard work Gulmira was able to expand her business and she now earns a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS). Her inventory is currently limited, so Gulmira turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 100,000 som (KGS) loan. She plans to invest the income she earns into further development of the business. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1103910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"expand her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzylkiya town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-05-30T04:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-29T04:00:06Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3258},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3172},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3252},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3416},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3502},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3589},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3679},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3771},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3865},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3962},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4061},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4162},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4267},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4373},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4483},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4595},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4709},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4827},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4948},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5072},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5198},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5328},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5178}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":429451,"name":"Maria Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, vive con su esposo y tres hijos, todos ellos trabajan, por su parte apoya a su esposo en la agricultura quien siempre se a dedicado al cultivo de ma\u00edz, no tienen un horario establecido pero a trav\u00e9s de este trabajo a logrado mantener a su familia.\nElla solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en insumos agr\u00edcolas como el abono, herbicidas, esta compra le permitir\u00e1 obtener lo necesario para trabajar en la tierra y recibir una buena producci\u00f3n.\nEl objetivo de Mar\u00eda es aumentar sus cultivos y darle lo mejor a sus hijos ayud\u00e1ndoles a superarse.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda lives with her husband and three children.

This business is popular in the Mongolian market. She has been running her business since 2006. She buys the skins from the rural households and herders and sells them to the customers in urban areas. Bringing the livestock meat and skins to the city is very expensive. She lives with her son and daughter in an apartment in Kherlen, an eastern city in Mongolia. Her daughter works as a vendor in the grocery store and her son attends the secondary school. Altankhuar is requesting a loan to buy the building materials to renovate her apartment rooms. She is planning to replace the windows of her rooms with better insulated windows. It is very important to reduce the heat loss and emissions through the windows. In the winter, she uses the furnace with coal to warm her apartment. But using the coal creates too much air pollution. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1107155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to cover the cost of replacing windows in her house and reduce heat loss and emissions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Kherlen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-05-30T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-29T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Altankhuar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":146360},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":189727.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":197177.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":207664.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":208110.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":227899.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":230194.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":237595.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":252573.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":259497.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":269358.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":273842.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.53},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.48,"local_amount":146360,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":147911.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294313333,"comment":null},{"amount":145.81,"local_amount":189727.07,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":191738.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301369435,"comment":null},{"amount":151.53,"local_amount":197177.02,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":199267.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308129204,"comment":null},{"amount":159.6,"local_amount":207664.04,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":209865.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315365079,"comment":null},{"amount":159.93,"local_amount":208110.8,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":210317.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322974189,"comment":null},{"amount":175.15,"local_amount":227899.25,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":230315.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331111358,"comment":null},{"amount":176.91,"local_amount":230194.44,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":232634.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339500916,"comment":null},{"amount":182.59,"local_amount":237595.77,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":240114.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347053089,"comment":null},{"amount":811,"local_amount":1055271.61,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1066459.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355798834,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-06T01:23:40Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T12:18:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":432191,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a single man who has been doing welding for the last five years.

He spends four hours a day at his work and his wife helps a lot with cooking and preparation of sauces.  In the morning, Luis works at a natural product company for eight hours.  He believes his business is going well because he is a hard worker, a good cook and, above all else, is kind and responsible.\r\n\r\nLuis is very grateful for the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he can buy tables, chairs and benches for his customers.  This will allow him to provide better customer service and improve his income, so he can continue striving toward making his grandest dream come true: \"To give his children a good education and, especially, a good quality of life\".\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1101500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It has recently become an important point between the mountain region and the coastal region of Ecuador. It's a special place, not just because of it's rich ethnic diversity but also for the unusual landscapes that can be seen as soon as you enter the city. Santo Domingo de los Colorados is part of the recently-formed province of Santo Domingo Ts\u00e1chilas. The main holiday in Santo Domingo is celebrated with a huge influx of visitors and commercial and cultural exchanges. A large fair takes place on the grounds of the Cattlemen's Association. At the fair, examples of the different breeds and mixed breeds of cows from ranches all over the region are shown in competition. \r\n\r\nJefferson has had a party supply store for 2 years.

Twelve years ago, she established her sewing workshop where she produces blouses, dresses, uniforms, T-shirts, skirts, and other articles.  Her workshop is situated in an area behind her house that has adequate space for her to work.  Another reason why she started this business was because she needed to support her children as their provider and help them excel.  Rosa has her own customer base, which motivates her to make more clothes that are of good quality.  This will keep her customers satisfied.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa has requested two loan from ODEF.  She says that she has done incredibly well since buying two other machines.  With her current loan of 25,000 HNL, Rosa will invest in her workshop since it has gradually deteriorated and is need of improvements.  She will replace the entire roof and electrical system so that her business will have a better appearance.  This will enable her to continue working in a satisfactory manner, just as she has done to this point.  Her goal is to expand in the marketplace by gaining new customers.

is Arceli, 52, a resident of Taguig City, Philippines. She is married to Frank, a driver, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nArceli operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArceli hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.
