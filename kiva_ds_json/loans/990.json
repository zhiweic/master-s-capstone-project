With his loan, he intends to manually prepare the land. This is how he conserves the best soil - he buys fertilizer, corn seeds, and other products which he needs for cultivation. Furthermore, it is to pay for the labor of growing and caring for the crops by manually eliminating weeds to avoid use of chemicals, as well as some cultivation work like making layers to avoid soil erosion due to the rain.

According to her, half of her income goes in rent of her stall so she struggles with a shortage of capital.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this situation, she is seeking a loan of PHP 7,000. This amount will allow her to buy stocks of soft drinks, frozen foods and various kinds of street foods. She is hoping that this loan amount will be granted so she can get ahead in life and establish her own refreshment stall

She studied systems engineering right out of school at her parents' urging. She confesses that she never enjoyed it, so she does not work in that field. She started a business selling clothing and beauty products from her home. In the beginning, it was very difficult to get clients. She offered her merchandise door-to-door. With time, thanks to her hard work, she has built up a customer base. Her customers seek her out and make orders. She now has a large uniform order. Now that things are going very well for her, she has decided to study a career that she has always loved: civil engineering. She has one year left and she is already working for the local government as a work supervisor. Thanks to her abilities, a group of architects has recently asked her to be part of their construction project. She will make a good income for the duration of the project. She is very happy and has many plans for specialization; \"my journey is still beginning. I want to specialize in roads,\" she confirms. This is her second loan with MFP. She hopes to receive a small loan in order to obtain her goals and improve her business. She promises to be punctual in paying her quotas; she likes being part of this group.\r\nYeny will invest this loan in the purchase of varied clothing for the Christmas season. She already has orders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1232019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy varied modern clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-10T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-10T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yeny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":435.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":452.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":466.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":482.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":514.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":529.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":550.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":570.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.32},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.23},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":493537,"name":"Concepcion De Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Concepci\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda de cuarenta y cinco a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y su hijo; ella posee una venta de ropa camisas, pantalones, vestidos  para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os, se ha hecho de mucha experiencia en las ventas y eso le ayuda a obtener las mejores ganancias; comercia desde su vivienda y ya tiene mucha clientela que la prefiere por la calidad del producto, los buenos precios y sobre todo por el excelente servicio; Concepci\u00f3n es una mujer emprendedora, dedicada a su labor y con muchas ganas de salir adelante, siempre esta a la expectativa de nuevas oportunidades que le permitan estar un paso mas cerca del \u00e9xito y no se rendir\u00e1 hasta lograrlo por completo; en las ultimas semanas  aumento la demanda y quiere aprovechar para realizar una nueva inversi\u00f3n por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar ropa  por mayor.

At the age of 20 he bought his first lands and started to produce his own coffee. Later, at the age of 22, he got married. He and his wife have worked together to sow and reap coffee. Together they have four children who have helped them with the work on the plantations. Since his wife passed away and his children got married, Jos\u00e9 has had to take on all the work of coffee production himself. He currently has four hectares which he sows, producing 8 tonnes in the harvest. He wants to increase this amount, so he is requesting a loan for the purchase of fertilizers to help his plants produce more coffee.

She lives in the company of Antonio, her husband of 12 years. Both have 2 children, Daniel and Oder, who they take care of in their own home.  \r\n\r\nSince she was a young girl she lived near the agricultural fields. Her parents taught her everything that she now knows about the field. She possesses her own agricultural areas where sows vegetables and other basic need products. She takes good care of her crops, mostly because she learned to sow organically the way it was done before her grandparents. This yields high quality crops, thanks to which she has good earnings. \r\n\r\nNow she hopes to continue to improve the quality of her food. She knows that she will achieve this because she is hardworking. Also, she receives the support of her husband who works as a construction worker; he builds a variety of houses. \r\n\r\nNow she concentrates all her energy to improve her income to improve the quality of life of her children. This is her third loan. She is part of the solidarity group \u201cManos Fuertes\u201d (Strong Hands) where she feels developed because of the financial help to progress her business. She promises to be punctual in her payments.

Damiano hires personnel to help him with labor on his coffee plantation and so he contributes to the finances of these people and their families.  Throughout his coffee plantation he has planted some fruit trees that provide shade for the coffee plants.  For his next harvest he needs to plant more because there is half a hectare on his coffee plantation that hasn't been sown.  He also needs to do cultural cleaning and conservation work on his land, which is why he needs this loan.  He knows that he will have a better harvest is he uses the loan as he has planned and this will make him better earnings, which will in turn be reflected in the improvement of his quality of life.

","en":"Daler is a young, single man who lives with his parents. For the past 5 years, he has been working in the field of building renovations. His father is a security guard and his mother is a homemaker. The salaries of both Daler and his father go to support the family.

She lives with her 3 children: Madeli, Dayana, and Darlin, who she cares for in the house that she inherited 2 years ago. She is a fighting woman; since she was a young woman, she learned to care for her children all by herself. She doesn\u2019t get intimidated, as she has a lot of knowledge of life in the fields. Her main economic income centers on the production of milk; she has 2 cows, a calf and a bull. She hopes to be able to get ahead by acquiring more cows. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe business of selling milk is very good; a processing company buys the liters that my cows produce every day,\u201d she states. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s for this reason that a short time ago, she stopped sowing her fields in abundance; now, she only has small plots of land like beans and potatoes, which she continues selling but in smaller amounts. She hopes that the sale of a new milk cow will materialize so she can plant alfalfa on her farmland and in this way be able to feed her animals, as she wants to have more than 10 cows in production. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the collective group \u201cMujeres Yanamarquinas\u201d (Yanamarquina Women) and this is her 3rd loan with MFP, where she feels developed, since she receives economic help to progress in her business. Because of this, she promises to be punctual in paying off her quotas. Ofelia will invest the money in the purchase of a milk cow in order to increase the milk production of her cattle.

She is on her second individual loan with the organization, after having duly repaid the previous loan.

She will then resell them door-to-door, to a clientele mostly composed of the town\u2019s household heads.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to make a monthly benefit of 50,000 FCFA. It will mostly be reinvested to contribute to the family\u2019s expenses and to repay her loan and its interests, with the remainder to be reinvested in her

Although she didn't enter college, she is still able to manage her business through the help of her parents. \r\n\r\nRosalina would like to take out a loan of PHP30,000 to buy feed and vitamins for her hogs and to buy supplies to maintain her farm plot. She knows that through this loan she could ensure the proper growth of her hogs. In addition, she could help her parents in preparing the farm plot and buying some farm supplies. Rosalina assures that she can obtain greater profit due to her hard labor and adaptation of new techniques in raising healthy hogs and producing corn crops.

She lives with her \u200b\u200bhusband and children in the house she inherited from her parents many years ago. Her life has always been in constant contact with field work, as her parents and her grandmother taught her since she was a small child. \r\n\r\nFarming and animal husbandry have always been a part of her life, even more so as her work and effort are for the benefit of her children who are dependent on her. She supports each one's education.\r\n\r\nAna dedicates every day to raising cows and bulls. She buys them when they are young and then fattens them up to sell. She also feeds her cows well so that she can later breed them, and during the lactation period, milk them and sell them. For this she has built a stable at her house for her cows and bulls; she raises them with such dedication and love that she gives each one a name. \r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to build a small dairy for which she is preparing and training herself.

is 51 years old, and is from a small village of Sagarejo district, Kakheti region, East Georgia. She lives with her husband, son, daughter-in-law and two infant grandchildren. Her husband works as a smith and gets a monthly income. The family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. Ekaterine owns a plot of land, where she has planted 40 nut-trees. In addition, they have two horses, which are used for taking the wood from the forest by her husband and son. Each member of the family works hard and has rich experience in their business. \r\n\r\nLuba requested a loan to purchase a car.

She and her husband work in a hospital, but the main source of the family's income is from the work Khaukharkul and her husband do in animal husbandry and growing crops. They began 29 years ago with a start-up sum of 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS). Today their farm includes 3 dairy cows, a calf, a bull, 55 head of sheep and 2 horses, and the family also works 1.5 hectares of irrigated land. Their monthly income from their farm is around 15,000 KGS. For the purpose of further developing her business, Khaukharkul has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy bulls. She plans to re-invest the income generated by the loan into further developing her business and improving her housing conditions.

Salkyn is a hard-working, patient and open-hearted woman. As the main breadwinner of the family, she raises cattle and grows crops. Having started 37 years ago with a sum of only 3,000 Som (KGS), her farm now includes 3 head of cattle and 6 head of smaller livestock. The monthly income from the farm is 6,000 KGS. Salkyn has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS for the purpose of further developing her business. She plans to buy sheep to fatten and sell. Salkyn will use the income generated by this loan to further expand her business and to have the opportunity to improve her housing conditions.

She lives with one of her two daughters, Any, whom she cares for in the house that she inherited from her parents 15 years ago. \r\n\r\nShe has 8 good quality cows, as well as 80 sheep that she cares for with dedication. Before the sun rises, she takes her animals to the heights above her village, where they can find the best natural pastures for grazing. Her effort is rewarded every time she markets the milk produced by her cows. She obtains several liters a day, so much that she loses count of how many liters she sells to a processing company that comes to her house every day. \r\n\r\nAlong with her work, she plants crops as part of a group as well as independently, which also generates a good income.

Although the kiosk business has been operating successfully for 6 years, most of the profit is used to cover her children\u2019s school fees. So Dorkas wants to improve the prospects of her business by adding more stock. To enable her purchase more products such as instant noodles, cigarettes, snacks, candy, cold drinks, soap and pens, Dorkas is applying for a 3,000,000 IDR loan from TLM. She is convinced that with this loan and an improved range of products, the business income will increase to provide a stable income to cover increasing family expenditures.

This is his ninth loan, and the previous eight have all been repaid in full. \r\n\r\nThis loan will enable him to buy 5 tonnes of maize and 1 tonne of sorghum. He buys his supplies in the villages in Garalo and the surrounding area. The cereals are stored in his shop before being resold for cash to men and women from Sikasso and Bamako. Often, he transports the cereals to Bamako if required. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Drissa envisages earning an average of 150 000 CFA francs per month. The money remaining after loan repayments will go towards investing in his business. He is intending to become a wholesaler in Bougouni.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1232532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-11T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-11T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Drissa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":167184.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179888,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":167184.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029767,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":167184.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399923993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T03:10:47Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:51:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":493899,"name":"Moustapha","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Moustapha est un homme mari\u00e9 de 58 ans et p\u00e8re de 4 enfants.

is a mother who has a strong faith and is determined to become successful in the future. She is 49 years old and widowed. Despite this hardship, she aims to improve her variety store and her hog-raising business to generate sufficient income and support the education of her three children. Two of her children are far enough along in school to need more financial support for their school fees and allowances. For this reason, Lalaine hopes to improve and strengthen her business. By generating a higher income to support the education of her children she hopes to enable them to earn degrees and become professionals someday. \r\n\r\nTo improve the business, Lalaine is asking for a loan of 15,000 PHP to buy soft drinks, canned goods, noodles, snack foods, biscuits, candies, laundry soaps, beverages, and seasonings to sell.

Antonia, her husband, and her four children, three sons and one daughter, study and work together, contributing to the household economy and improving the whole family's quality of life. She is a hard-working woman and really wants to move forward economically with her family. Currently, she wants to start a new business in her home, since she has enough space to have a grocery store and have a machine to make corn dough available to her customers. This will benefit many families near her home. This is why she sees the need to invest in opening this business, which is why she is applying for a loan of 8,000.00 GTC to pay for a corn dough machine that they recently bought.

In his free times he likes to spend a bit of time reading and sometimes his wife cooks for him the tasty dish Pachamanca [Peruvian dish baked on top of heated stones, consisting of meat and produce] in order to spoil him, as this is his favorite food.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of effort and dedication, Manuel works day by day in agriculture. He has a small plot of land where he grows cotton. Every day in the early hours of the morning he begins his field labors, working approximately eight hours, and he believes that because of his experience things are going well.\r\n\r\nManuel is very grateful for the Kiva loans, and thanks to the help they give he can cover the cost of maintenance, irrigation, and harvesting the cotton crops. This is why Manuel hopes to have a good harvest in order to be able to sell it at a good price, and thus continue working and striving in order to get ahead and attain his big dream of being able to expand his business soon and to have more diverse crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1232611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to cover the expenses of the maintenance of his crop including irrigation and harvesting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-11-11T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-11T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel Augusto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3001.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482917,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-27T15:47:44Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":493934,"name":"Benita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.
