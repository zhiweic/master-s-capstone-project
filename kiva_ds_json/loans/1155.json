is 26 years old. He lives in Senaki District with his sister and parents. His sister works at local pharmacy and gets a small monthly income which is the only source of income for their family. It is hardly enough for food and, according to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. Aleksandre has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start-up a  family business without any success. His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nAleksandre is requesting a loan from Credo to start-up family business. He will use his loan to start a used-clothing business and he plans to rent a commercial space to open his shop. Aleksandre's loan has been approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo that envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products.

Natalia has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but has never had any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her family's low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNatalia is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, she has a milk cow and produces cheese products to sell. Teimuraz has a car and works among the local people as a taxi driver. Natalia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Natalia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to traditional credit products.

Koba requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of his low income and the family's poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nKoba works as a driver at a private company and gets a monthly income. His wife works as a nurse at a local kindergarten. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nKoba requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Koba has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. \r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Koba will purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver. He has a rich experience of being a driver and hopes that this will be profitable for his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is 43 years old. He lives in Kvareli District with his wife, Tamar, and mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Solomon requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nSolomon is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have two pigs and 0.5 hectare of agricultural land, where maize is grown. He sells the harvested maize at local markets. Tamar works as a nurse at a local kindergarten. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nSolomon requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Solomon has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Solomon will purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver. After purchasing a car, he will be able to increase the income of his family. Part of the profit will be reinvested in the agricultural business. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1378213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kvareli","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solomon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":108.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":107.51},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":109.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":113.62},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":114.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":118.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":119.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":122.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":127.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":127.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":131.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":133.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":136.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":139.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":142.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":145.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":148.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":151.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.46},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":578546,"name":"Twitezimbere Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Consolatte fait partie du groupe Twitezimbere et habite \u00e0  Gutega.

He began a new business, together with his friend. They rented a small space, where they used to sell live fish. But now, Armen works separately, and he has enriched the services of his business. Armen not only sells the fish, but he also has all the needed equipment to prepare good and tasty fish on the grill. Armen\u2019s stall is very famous and visited daily by the people living nearby, and also by those who especially want to taste fish prepared by Armen.\r\n\r\nThe income from the fish business satisfies Armen, but he plans to enlarge both the assortment of fish and his business services. Armen asks a loan of 670,000 Armenian drams. He will use part of this loan to rent a car for the delivery of prepared fish, and part to buy a lot of fish to

This led him to access UGAFODE Microfinance Limited (MDI) services, which have taken him to a greater level.

The group is represented by Helam who, by profession, is a tailor in the village. She is pictured in the photograph with her right hand raised. Helam is married and blessed with two sons and her husband provides satellite television connections in the village. \r\n\r\nHelam had once started a tailoring business in the past but due to some family problem, she had to close down the shop. However, the income her husband generates from the satellite TV business was not enough to provide for all the family's expenses. So, she decided to start tailoring in the village once again, and though she did not get a huge amount of profit, she said that she is able to save some for her sons' schooling expenses and other monthly family expenses. \r\n\r\nShe started the tailoring business in 2011, and she said that she is able to save some from her daily and monthly income. At the same time, she also weaves shawls and other women's traditional wrap-around garments for sale. She has also purchased lots of household items for the house and her husband has also purchased more cable wire for expanding his satellite television business. He wants to expand to the interior of the village and also in the neighbouring villages. Helam said this is very reliable and very profitable, because they are the only one providing the satellite television network in the area. At the same time, with the loan from Kiva, she wants to buy more sewing machines, tailoring materials, cloth fabric, and other essential items for expanding her tailoring business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1374915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy more fabrics and sewing machines for expanding her tailoring business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T16:30:04Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Warnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkhotin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinkhonem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneimoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatnunnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-15T16:21:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577038,"name":"Felismina","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Felismina de 33 anos de idade, \u00e9 solteira e tem 1 filho ainda sem idade escolar.

From a very young age, she has been selling informally for a living. She married very young and as a result of that situation, she\u2019s had to work to cover the household expenses. She has always engaged in activities like selling food and selling products by catalog. She lives with her three children and is a single mother who has struggled to get her children ahead. Her oldest daughter has graduated from high school and she is the one who helps with the housework.\r\n\r\nThe selling is done on an intermittent basis or whenever she is requested for food preparation. She visits the city to buy all the supplies and to be prepared to meet the needs.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to lay flooring in her home. Currently, it is just cement, but she wants to lay a tile floor seeing as she plans to set up a small pi\u00f1ata shop there. She is familiar with this type of business, but for lack of a suitable place, she has not been able to set it up.\r\n\r\nAfter remodeling her home, she will set up the business that she has always planned to have and with it offer a rare service, although it has demand from the community. She has always been looking at how to slowly improve her home and make it more and more beautiful. \r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the main objective of the loan is to improve her home, by getting her business up and running, she will earn more income. She will also be providing a productive activity for her daughter, who will be her right-hand person in implementing this business.\r\n\r\nWhen asking her about the plans she has for the future, she said she has always dreamed of having her own business and run it with her family. She also dreams of having a sustainable income so she can provide the legacy of education to her young children so that they can be useful people in the

He lives in the Martvili District with his wife, son and mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Levan requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, whose milk is used to make cheese products. Besides that, they have 100 nut trees and 0.3 hectare of agricultural land where maize is grown. They sell cheese, nuts and maize locally at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLevan requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Levan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Levan will begin trading in cement. He will purchase a big stock of cement and then resell at a higher price. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1378692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to begin trade with cement","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Martvili","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T21:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T21:50:13Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Levan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.71},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":112.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":115.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":122.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":124.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":127.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":129.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":132.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":136.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":143.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":146.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.27},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":576886,"name":"Waheeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Waheeda, 38, is the responsible mother of 3 children.

For the past two years, Susan has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, milk, and bread. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Susan has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more items such as milk, soup and bread for the store to sell. This will help Susan to generate greater profits and boost her business. Susan hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a bicycle. \r\n\r\nSusan is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

\n\n","en":"The woman, who is the guardian of her house hearth and support for her children, has a grand idea to organize a new business.  Barno has been living very poorly for many years because her husband is a migrant worker and has a small salary, and cannot provide his two children with all the necessities.  The children require more comforts year-after-year because they develop with the developing world.  Barno decided to organize a business of sewing curtains.  She searched for help for a long time and finally learned about the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association for Business Women.  She participated in this course and obtained a lot of positives for herself.  She obtained a certificate upon completing the course.

Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNatia runs a pharmacy in her village. This is the only source of income for her family. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNatia requested a loan from Credo to startup a family business. Natia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Natia will purchase a stock of additional products such as hygiene items and baby food. As the pharmacy is expanded, the income is increased. Part of the profit will be reinvested in the same business. With another part, she will be able to provide wellbeing for her family members. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1349.35,"image":{"id":1378785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"to purchase additional products and expand the pharmacy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Nigoiti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T00:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T00:30:09Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":205.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":219.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":223.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":230.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":238.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":241.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":246.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":255.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":256.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":262.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":266.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":272.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":277.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":282.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":288.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":288.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":205.03,"local_amount":205.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":205.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613797,"comment":null},{"amount":219.24,"local_amount":219.24,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":219.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857510,"comment":null},{"amount":223.56,"local_amount":223.56,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":223.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134160,"comment":null},{"amount":230.1,"local_amount":230.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":230.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107745,"comment":null},{"amount":232.5,"local_amount":232.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":232.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255281,"comment":null},{"amount":238.92,"local_amount":238.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":238.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019415,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-07T17:11:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":576965,"name":"Gorpu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gorpu, a 28-year-old business woman from Liberia, is married and has two children, one four years old and attending school, and one nine months old.

He continued fighting with her and for her. He was obligated to sell the house where they lived in order to improve his wife's health.\r\n\r\nToday he lives in a rented mud house with his family. His daughters help him with the household chores; one works in the city as a housekeeper, the younger one studies in school, she has a 30 minute walk to arrive at her destination. Previously he worked making hammocks which he then sold in the city. Today he works farming (planting beans and corn) to support his family.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy the items to plant basic grains in the nearest city, it takes him 20 minutes to get to the highway to then take a bus or a car that travels throughout the area.

Shalva has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Shalva will purchase raw materials to sew shoes.

Part of the profit will be used to cover the family expenses and another part to reinvest in the same field. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She is pictured with her hand raised. The sudden demise of her father shocked her mother for a long time, which left her with no other option but to take care of her mother and brother. She had been running errands for a pharmacy shop in the town market since her childhood days, from where she learned how to maneuver a drug shop. The owner of the drug shop usually taught her and says \u201cyou can run one as well\u201d and she was very confident about it. The owner of the drug shop operates with a license and her B.Pharm Degree. It has been more than a couple of years since she has been running a drug shop in the town market.\r\n\r\nKimneichong runs a drug shop at the center of the town market. The town is about 40 kms away from the capital town of Imphal. She runs the drug shop with the assistance of the doctors posted in the District Health Centre. The nurses in the town and the villages also suggest the drugs that are most often required.  She initially started the business on her own but after her marriage, her husband has been giving a hand. She gets the drug supplies from the main town and sells them in the town market. Sometime her husband runs errands for Kimneichong. She profits a good amount from the drug shop because there are very few drug shops in the whole area. She wanted to run the drug shop with an abundant supply of drugs but usually ends up with a shortage of supplies. The insufficient capital is always the main reason for the shortage of stocks in the drug shop.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Kimneichong will refill the drug store and will earn more money. In the future, she will employ a trained nurse to give first aid services to the town and the nearby villages. She wants to make her living by selling life-saving drugs and provide the town with first aid medical services. The government-run district hospitals are defunct t due to the absence of staff, which leaves the town with no other options but to go to the city. She also plans to purchase a used minivan in the future and use it for public transport between the town and the main city.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in selling export garments from neighboring states, weaving, running a piggery and running a Paan shop. Kimneichong says her gratitude towards Kiva and WSDS is not justified by words. The contribution is appreciated by all the group members and they will always remain obliged. She says \u201cThank You Kiva.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1376727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To restock her pharmacy with more drugs and first aid supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kimneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaithem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneiching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boishi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":95000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-01T07:57:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577034,"name":"Malvina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Malvina is 21 years old.

Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe family owns a small plot of agricultural land where vegetables are grown. Harvested products are sold at the local market. Malvina's father has a car that he drives as a taxi to earn additional income for the family.\r\n\r\nMalvina requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Malvina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Malvina will open a caf\u00e9. She will pay the rent and purchase all the needed equipment and products to open the business. She already has found a very good place for a caf\u00e9. This place is in a populous area and Malvina hopes that it will help the business to be successful. She will work in the caf\u00e9 herself, in order to have minimum expenses.

Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nLia is a teacher. She is working at the local school as a Georgian language teacher on a small monthly salary. The family gets additional income from Lia\u2019s father\u2019s monthly salary and her mother\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n \r\nLia requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Lia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Lia will renovate an apartment to rent out. She has a space in a good area in a town. As Batumi district is becoming a very popular tourist area, there are more tourists every year spending their vacations there. Lia hopes after renovation is done, she will have no problem findung a renter immediately, to earn additional income for the family.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan,  will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She describes herself as hardworking.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Gbarnga, the capital City of Bong County. Bong is located in the centre of the country and is an agricultural hub.  The majority of residents are farmers growing rice, palm oil and cassava. \r\n\r\nTunapu has sold dried fish and soap for the past five years.  She works from 7am to 5pm each day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is having little capital. She intends to use the loan to buy more soap and fish for her business. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she gets money from her business for other uses.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to thank Kiva lenders in advance for their

This is the only income for the family, which is rarely enough to look after two daughters. \r\n\r\nNazi requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business.  Nazi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.  These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.  With her credit, Nazi will purchase more stocks of groceries for her grocery shop.

Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, near Tanzania. Inconsistent rains, especially recently, have made farming difficult, and the poverty rates in the county are above the Kenyan average. Beekeeping is somewhat new to Kwale, but the passion fruit farms and mangrove forests throughout the area provide excellent sources of nectar for bee colonies. Many farmers in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives, and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.  \r\n\r\nVeronica is married, and has seven children. Both she and her husband have been farming for twelve years and are currently growing oranges on their land. She is excited to start beekeeping because it will give her a source of high-quality, natural honey, which she enjoys eating. \r\n\r\nThis is Veronica's first loan and she plans to use the income generated by her hives to make some improvements around her farm. In the future, Veronica hopes to save up enough money to build a new family house.

lives and works in a small town in Kwale county. Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, and borders Tanzania to the south. Inconsistent rainfalls make farming difficult and contribute to the area's high poverty rates. Despite the unreliable rainfall, bees in the region have two excellent sources of food, from wild mangrove forest and local passion fruit plantations. Beekeeping is relatively new to the area, but many farmers are very interested in owning hives. \r\n\r\nRegun is unmarried and has been farming for six years. He is currently growing passion fruit on his land. He is excited to start beekeeping because he likes learning about bees, and he is also happy to have a secondary income source from honey. \r\n\r\nThis is Regun's first loan, and he plans to use the money generated from his hives to help pay school fees. Regun's hope for the future is to work for Honey Care, inspecting beehives as a Hive Technician.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"At first I did not show any interest in the creation of silver jewelry and instead learned to carve wood. However, during secondary school, I eventually became drawn to the creation of fine silver jewelry. Due to harsh economic circumstances, I had to work after school. I walked far everyday to Celuk, a village renowned for its silver and gold jewelry where I began to acquire the elements of my craft.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to all of you for your support and for offering me this microcredit, which will make it easier for me to purchase the materials I need. I wish to promote my collections so that many more people can see them, and hopefully my sales will increase over last year. If that happens, it will really help us here.

the citizens are Haitians. She lives in a modest home with her two children. With her efforts, she can make extra income and provide for her family. She enjoys going to work and taking care of her children. Margalet is excited to be taking out her third loan from Esperanza. She runs a business selling cosmetic products. She has had her business for nearly two years. She began her business by selling miscellaneous products that she bought with her first loan. Margaret is planning to use this new loan to invest in her business by buying more cosmetics. She will reinvest the profits in her business by purchasing more products and expanding her business, offering more options and gaining new clients. Margalet dreams of becoming someone with a very large business; she wants to have a general store.

Ella vive en una comunidad muy desarrollada que est\u00e1 dividida por manzanas (blocks) los habitantes de la comunidad son todos muy amables, la mayor\u00eda de ellos se dedica la cultivo de ma\u00edz, otros tienen negocios diferentes como comercios. \n\nDo\u00f1a Celia tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada desde hace 19 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Francisco juntos han formado una familia con tres ni\u00f1os dos ellos van a la escuela, la se\u00f1ora Celia se dedica al cultivo de hongos setas desde hace ocho a\u00f1os Do\u00f1a Celia Comento \u201cMe gusto cultivar mis hongos porque mi mama se dedicaba al cultivo de champi\u00f1ones, era un negocio muy bueno entonces fue como decid\u00ed iniciar con el cultivo de los hongos setas aunque es un negocio donde se requiere mucho trabajo me gusta mucho\u201d Esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para comprar cincuenta piezas de bolsas incubadoras para el cultivo de sus hongos,  su cr\u00e9dito le ayudar\u00e1 a comprar sus bolsas que son un poco caras. Do\u00f1a Celia tomo algunos cursos para saber c\u00f3mo mejorar el cultivo de sus hongos platica un poco de como los prepara. Primero necesita una tonelada de zacate picado el mismo zacate lo remoja en agua tiene que estar bien remojado, para ver si tiene el 70% de agua lo extiende muy bien y si le sale agua es porque tiene el agua que necesita. Despu\u00e9s se junta todo como un colch\u00f3n se tapa muy bien con un pl\u00e1stico negro esta preparaci\u00f3n se deja reposar un d\u00eda completo, al tercer d\u00eda se cambia de lugar y tambi\u00e9n se tapa perfectamente, al s\u00e9ptimo d\u00eda el zacate se esteriliza a ba\u00f1o Mar\u00eda, este producto se deja en botes reposando para que al siguiente d\u00eda se pueda sembrar en las bolsas incubadoras en ellas se pone zacate estas bolsas tienen que pesar 14 kilos, se dejan reposando 15 d\u00edas, para despu\u00e9s pasarlas al invernadero este proceso se le conoce como producci\u00f3n y finalmente solo espera para que los hongos inicien a brotar de la bolsa. Y es cuando Do\u00f1a Celia cada tercer d\u00eda tiene que cosechar sus hongos Zetas para sacarlos a la venta, Todos los d\u00edas se tiene que levantar a las cuatro de la ma\u00f1ana para cosecharlos y as\u00ed reci\u00e9n cortados los lleva al mercado para ofrecerlos a la plaza, Do\u00f1a Celia dice que tiene ya clientas seguras, en el negocio le va muy bien sabe muy el proceso la \u00fanica dificultad que presenta es cuando las bolsas incubadoras inician a mancharse de un color caf\u00e9 esto significan malas noticias porque en esa bolsa no saldr\u00e1n hongos aunque para Do\u00f1a Celia significan perdidas de ganancias e inversi\u00f3n pero esto no la limita para tener muy presente su meta, la se\u00f1ora Celia sue\u00f1a con tener m\u00e1s invernaderos y producir m\u00e1s hongos para aumentar sus ganancias y as\u00ed ayudar con los gastos de educaci\u00f3n de sus tres ni\u00f1os.\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Celia is a very cheerful woman, always telling jokes. She finds the kind and funny side to everything, but she is also a very hardworking person. She lives in a very developed community that is divided into blocks. The residents of the community are friendly. Most of them grow corn and others have different businesses, such as stores.  \r\n\r\nCelia is 39 years old. She has been married for 19 years to Francisco. Together they have made a family with three children. Two of them go to elementary school. Celia has grown seta mushrooms for 8 years. Celia remarked \u201cI like to grow my seta mushrooms because my mother grew mushrooms. It was a very good business, so that was how I decided to start growing seta mushrooms. Although it is a business that requires a lot of work, I like it a lot.\" This time, she is asking for a loan to buy fifty units of incubator bags to buy the mushrooms. The loan will help her buy the bags, as they are a little expensive. Celia took some courses to learn how to improve at growing mushrooms. She talked a little about how she prepares them. First, she needs a ton of chopped grass. She wets the grass in water. It has to be really wet. If it is 70% water it expands well and if water is dripping it means it has all the water it needs. She pushes it all together like a mattress and covers it really well with a black tarp. She lets this sit for an entire day. The third day she moves it and covers it well again. The seventh day the grass is sterilized with steam. The result is put into containers until the next day, when it can be put into the incubator bags. The grass in the bags has to weigh 14 kilos. They are left for 15 days and then put in a green house. This process is known as the production, and finally she just has to wait for the mushrooms to start to sprout from the bag. Then Celia has to harvest the seta mushrooms every third day to sell them. Every day, she has to get up at four in the morning to harvest them and take them freshly cut to the market to sell them in the plaza. Celia says that she already has regular customers. The business is going very well for her and she knows the process very well. The only problem she has is when the incubator bags start to get a brown color. That is bad news because no mushrooms will come out of that bag. Although this means a loss of profit and investment for Celia, it doesn't limit her because she is focused on her goal. Celia dreams of having more greenhouses and producing more mushrooms to increase her profits and help pay for the education of her three children.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":649.44,"image":{"id":1377067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy incubator bags to grow her seta mushrooms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Juan de las Manzanas, Ixtlahuaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1298.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1365.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1462.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1511.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1611.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1673.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1759.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1890.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1948.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2055.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2155.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96.57,"local_amount":1266.46,"processed_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1267.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698652,"comment":null},{"amount":99.01,"local_amount":1298.64,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1299.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944840,"comment":null},{"amount":104.13,"local_amount":1365.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1366.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227914,"comment":null},{"amount":111.56,"local_amount":1463.04,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1463.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991762,"comment":null},{"amount":115.27,"local_amount":1511.85,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644424,"comment":null},{"amount":122.9,"local_amount":1611.78,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1612.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877896,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-01T17:46:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577171,"name":"Fatmata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Sierra Leone!

from Sierra Leone! The borrower is 37-year-old Fatmata from Kandeh town Bo. She is married and has four children between the ages of 2 and 22. Her children are attending school. Fatmata runs a palm oil business, where she sells palm oil, beans and peppers. She has been running this business for two years. She works at the business ten hours per day, seven days per week. Fatmata says that the main challenges to her business are that purchasing power is sometime very low, that she doesn\u2019t have many items on her table, and that she lacks funds to expand her business. Fatmata has applied for a loan in order to buy food items, including rice, palm oil and cooking oil, for her food stand. The extra income from this loan will allow her to feed her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to expand her food stand business.
