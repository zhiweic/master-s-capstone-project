To make a living, she has been working as a paid construction worker in a local area while her brother helps the family to earn extra income by working as a motor-taxi driver in the local area. The current business earns her family 40,000 KHR per day and allow them to save 20,000 KHR each day after daily expenses.\r\n \r\nVuthdy\u2019s group consists of two members who have been with VisionFund for four cycles. The previous loans, which she completely paid back, have supported her business and improved her family\u2019s burden. Now she is leading her group to ask for a loan of 1,400,000 KHR each. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy a proper motorbike for her brother\u2019s transportation service because the old motor was seriously broken.

She says that this is the first time that she has been a member of Pro Mujer and she joined on the invitation of a friend who is a member of the institution. She currently has a business knitting sweaters for babies. She let us know that she started this business on her own initiative and, to date, she is doing well.\r\nThe loan that she is requesting now is to increase her capital to buy wool from the merchants in the city of El Alto which she will later knit and sell from her permanent stall. This type of work enables her to generate income to support her family as much as possible. She lives with her partner and 4 children.\r\nWhen she was asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answered that she likes the credit and health training. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":1214549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-10-13T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-12T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fania\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela Segundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":19696.95,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3224.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3294.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3294.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3294.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3294.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3294.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":480.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":480.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":480.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":470.61,"local_amount":3224.17,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3251.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095521,"comment":null},{"amount":961.74,"local_amount":6589.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6645.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235596,"comment":null},{"amount":480.88,"local_amount":3294.52,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617429,"comment":null},{"amount":480.87,"local_amount":3294.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172023,"comment":null},{"amount":480.9,"local_amount":3294.7,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:19:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-16T10:24:56Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T18:19:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":481714,"name":"Daliborka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daliborka is a 36-year-old married woman.

The group is comprised of 10 members and is directed by a board of which Domitila is the president. The businesses that the members run are varied and include: a carpentry, selling fruit, selling soaps, a business where people can make phone calls, selling games, a neighborhood store, selling sporting goods, sewing quilts, selling petticoats, weaving blankets, selling sweaters. \r\nThe loan will benefit the group of micro-entrepreneurs of which Domitila is a member. She says that she has been a member of Pro Mujer for years and became a member on the invitation of a friend who was a member. Currently, she has a business selling vegetables.

They have twin sons who are 13 years old.  Through great effort, they were able to build a house made of solid materials.  Erlinda is always dedicated to her family, so she chose to open a small business in her home.  Since then, she has managed her grocery store.  For more than 14 years, she has worked as a merchant.  However, her business has suffered as a result of the increased prices being charged by her suppliers.  Erlinda is always determined to continue her family business despite all of the challenges because this is the only way for her to educate and feed her children.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo overcome these challenges, Erlinda wants to buy products in bulk (preferably nonperishable goods) so that she can continue her business and generate more income.  In addition, she does not rule out the possibility of expanding her business by offering more products at lower prices.  She feels that the loan will help her accomplish these goals.  As of this date, Erlinda has received six loans from MFP.  She always tries to complete her payments on time and has maintained a good credit history.

Her main products are perfumes, makeup, jewelry, facial creams, deodorants and talcum powder, which she distributes among a clientele made up of other office employees, friends, and references. \r\n\r\nShe started this business 4 years ago, when a friend who also sells merchandise recommended to her that she start selling products from her catalog. Now she has a good business selling products from well-known brands, showing the catalog to her coworkers. \r\n\r\nOne of the challenges in her business is her insufficient capital, and because of this Nayibe has requested a Kiva loan in order to purchase a greater number of products to sell, such as perfumes, creams, makeup and jewelry, because every day a lot of customers come by. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that with more working capital she will be able to attend to the high demand for her products, during the Valentine\u2019s Day season and the end of the year, where her sales usually increase and she logically earns much more. \r\n\r\nNayibe is 48 years old and the mother of 3 children, from the ages of 23 and 27 years. She has as a goal to get further ahead and increase her earnings to remodel her house, because for her, having a place that is safe and good to live is very important. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1215077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase a greater number of products to sell, like perfumes, creams, makeup and jewelry. \r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-14T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-13T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nayibe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87807},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89856},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91952},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94098},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96294},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98540},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100840},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":103193},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":105601},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":108065},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110586},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":113168}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":483453,"name":"Angelita Porfiria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Angelita tiene 61 a\u00f1os de edad de estado civil casada tiene 1 hijo de 10 a\u00f1os .Compro una vitrina y perchas de all\u00ed ella vende laminas, cuadernos hasta art\u00edculos de bazar y pocos v\u00edveres.

Of course, she also wants to improve her business so that it will become stable.\r\n\r\nHaving her happy and loving family, Sylvia seems to be already fulfilled with her life but according to her, nothing is permanent in life. Thus, she must strive harder and look for better opportunities that will improve her family's life.

is Violeta. She previously accessed a 12,000 PHP loan that she used to buy additional stock of liquor and other beverages. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and for her personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 14,000 PHP loan to buy additional stock of liquor and other beverages. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nVioleta hopes her business will expand through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

To make a living, he has been farming rice for 33 years and working as a construction worker in the local area, while his wife is a homemaker and also raises cows. Saroen can earn approximately 30,000 KHR per day and manages to save about 10,000 KHR each day after offsetting daily expenses.

Pisco is a city with a very warm, welcoming climate. It is an agricultural area where cotton and corn are cultivated, among other crops. Hellen is a very hard-working young woman, but when she has free time she greatly enjoys playing sports. She especially loves playing volleyball with her friends and neighbours. However, her favourite thing to do is to enjoy her favourite food, the rich \"caucau de pollo\". Because of her lack of economic resources, she was only able to stay in school up to the fifth grade of secondary school, but she would have liked to study gastronomy, since she loves cooking.\r\nEvery day, Hellen works in her food sales business. She works approximately ten hours per day and is able to serve up to 25 customers in one day. She thinks that things are going well for her in her business because she is very kind to her customers, and, above all, because her food is delicious.\r\nHellen is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy chairs, two tables, and paint her business, among other things.

Because of this, Marta needs a bit more money since her husband's income is not sufficient for their costs.

People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy, and many national dishes are made with vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every table in an Azerbaijan family and are also used to make fresh punch. Saltanat's monthly income is 90 AZN.

The income totals 430 laris per month and is hardly enough to provide food for a four-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nGenadi requested a loan from Credo to restart his family business, which was stopped because of financial problems. His loan request was approved by a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

He is married and has 3 children, aged 8 months, 7 and 11 years. Two are school-going children. He has 1 additional dependent, who lives with him because he assists Abu in business. \r\nIn 2001, Abu established his Stationery (A4 paper, ledger books, files, markers, flip charts, chalk, staple machines, paper punch, pens, highlighters, stamp pads etc.) business. He began his business to further his education, because he was unprivileged.  His parents were subsistence farmers and at the age of 18 years he left his parents and started mining. Abu left mining and joined his elder brother in the city to assist in his business. His brother died after a short illness and he took over the entire business. \r\nWorking 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, Abu earns about Le 3,070,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 6,000,000. Abu has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy various products such as A4 papers, A3 papers, markers, ledger books, carbon paper and lubricating ink.  The balance of Le1,000 after these purchases will be used to pay his labourer.

People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce. Milk products are considered to be very healthy and are also present in everyday life.   \r\n\r\nThis is the one source of financial income in his family and not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children.
