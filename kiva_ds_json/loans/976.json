Because of this she\u2019s requesting this loan to pay for the expenses related to said course blocks to get her teaching degree.\r\n\r\nShe feels very grateful for the support she\u2019s gotten from Kiva and Ceprodel by granting this loan which will be a big help because her salary wouldn\u2019t be enough to carry out this process that in the future will lead to improved living conditions not

She does many activities during the day because her greatest effort is centered on getting ahead and improving economically.\r\n\r\nTogether with her husband, who works in construction, she also provides transportation in the motor vehicle she has; they use it to transport local residents to outlying areas.  She earns extra money doing this that helps her cover daily household expenses.  Because of this she keeps it in good operating condition.  \u201cEvery time I need money I turn to my motor vehicle because the other activities have their own capital,\u201d she comments.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 5th MFP loan.  In all this time she\u2019s been responsible and punctual but above all she enjoys being part of her association that\u2019s composed of mutually supportive, enterprising people.  Sayda will use the money to buy spare parts and service her motor vehicle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1223641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

With the help of these loans, they can buy or invest in things that their mere salaries do not let them buy or invest in.

At the moment, his wife doesn\u2019t have a job, so she looks after the children at home. Until 2011, they lived in a rental house or in his parents' house. In the last year, Batdelger\u2019s family bought a plot of land and has become \u201cthe real family\u201d in the full meaning. Now, they are living in a ger, a traditional Mongolian tent. The ger is built on the ground and doesn\u2019t have a fundament (foundation), so in the winter it may be cold if they don\u2019t have additional furnishings. Because the frozen land can cause a chill from below the ger, Batdelger is requesting 1,500,000 MNT to make a foundation and buy a thick layer of wool felt for his ger. By doing this, he and his family will be provided with good living conditions and overcome the winter\u2019s cold days.

For the last 8 years she\u2019s been a grocer.  She was able to set aside the ground floor of her house as a grocery store with support from her spouse and since then has been very well received by local neighbors generating good household income.\r\n\r\nShe believes that being able to be in her store allows her to keep in constant contact with her daughter since she was one of the motivating forces behind her opening the store.  Nevertheless, delays in product delivery from some of her suppliers cause problems because she constantly loses customers.

Most of them live in polygamous families in Mancourani I, one of the working-class neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nThis is their thirteenth loan with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  They are taking this loan in order to satisfy the needs of their customers.  Their previous loans were successfully completed.\r\n\r\nAmong the members of the BADEYA women's group, Nana sells dyed damask pagnes (traditional West-African fabrics).

She has set many good goals, and one of them is to distance herself from the social violence that her area is the victim of. To this end, she has looked for good alternatives, like selling cleaning supplies such as soaps, disinfectants, and bleach, among others. She works selling in the street and she has experience in sales which allows her to earn a good income. She has gained a lot of customers because people prefer her for the quality of her products, the good prices, and above all the excellent service. She is an enterprising woman who is dedicated to her work. She is determined and wants a more prosperous future. Every day she works to gain it. She is very happy and comfortable with her business.

He is married and has three dependent children. His wife works as a high school teacher. She takes their children\u2019s education very seriously. The children, Parviz, Nurullo, and Islom, all study either in high school or at the university. Bahtier works as an economist, but his income is insufficient to pay for his son\u2019s university studies; this year, Parviz has graduated from high school and now studies at a Turkish university. Parviz is very gifted young man. In his spare time he reads books and does sports. Bahtier is requesting a loan in the amount of 6,000 USD to pay for his son\u2019s university studies. Bahtier and Parviz are counting on your

is a Peruvian artist specializing in paintings with ecological themes. She would like to invest in the purchase of canvases, oils, and brushes to continue her work.\r\n\r\nMishelle has been selling through NOVICA since 2004. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I intended to study ecology, but didn't pass the entrance exam. Not one for giving up, I prepared to present the exam again. My parents suggested I also apply to the Fine Arts School, for they recognized my talents. I realized they were right, and that I could reach a compromise \u2013 I could paint ecological themes. I believe expression is an exercise, while art is the artist's reflection. I seek to communicate my reality through my work and the beauty of human sentiment through colors. My greatest challenge is to pursue my career while at the same time being a devoted mother to my daughter.\r\n\r\n\"I want to renew my themes and explore new styles to attract a larger audience. All I can say is thank you very much for your support through this microcredit.

She is an independent and hard working woman.  Through her hard work, and thanks to help from her family and nephews (who currently live with her), she was able to build a wood-framed house.  And so she is able to dedicate most of her time to her small grocery store that she set up in her home seven years ago.  With the store located in home, she maximizes her earnings.  It makes Irene very happy to help her customers because she has made a lot of friends through her store.  Everyone likes her, even though she sometimes has to battle with some customers who take advantage of their friendship to request items on credit and take a long time to settle their accounts.  Lately, Irene has had expanding the store on her mind.  That way she would be able to meet her customers demands.  It would be good for her to sell vegetables, beef and chicken, but only for the time being because in the future she wants to change the structure of her business, to have it well stocked just how she wants it.  The is Irene's eighteenth loan and she is committed, like always, to being responsible and punctual.  She is grateful for the confidence placed in her and happy with the way MFP has worked with her.  Likewise, she is grateful for her communal bank and the mutual respect they offer one another.

In his free time, he likes to play football with his friends and neighbors, and sometimes takes advantage of the chance to eat a very delicious \"chupe de camarones\" (Peruvian shrimp chowder), a traditional dish of his city.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, and with a great deal of effort and determination, Jos\u00e9 has worked for several years providing transportation services. He has a small taxi which he uses as his means of work. Every day, from a very early hour of the morning, Jos\u00e9 goes out to travel the streets of his city in search of passengers.\r\n\r\nHe can work around 12 hours a day, and believes it is going well because he knows the areas where he can find the greatest number of customers. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to the help offered he will be able to purchase a small car, which he will use to continue offering transportation services. In this way, Jos\u00e9 will continue working and doing his best, so that he and his family can better themselves, and so that he can achieve his dream of seeing his sons become good professionals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":920.54,"image":{"id":1223783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

She has a three-year-old daughter, Halsy, and she and her partner, Yuri, work hard to give their little girl everything they were unable to have as youngsters.\r\n\r\nOne of the things they have accomplished is to build their own house, which cost them many years of hard work.  With several options in mind, and with the help of her partner, she decided to establish a soda fountain and sell fruit juice and pastry.  In a year's time she was able to attract many customers and became more motivated in her work and started selling sandwiches and sodas to large institutions who were attracted to her tasty products.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys the fact that she can serve many people through her work, because it is something she always wanted to do.  Therefore, she would like to expand in the future.\r\n\r\nSometimes when she receives large orders and does not have the immediate capital to buy ingredients (which are ordered only one day in advance), she runs the risk of losing the order, and these are the ones that generate the most income.  This is her second loan through MFP and she is grateful for the confidence shown in her.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time.  \r\n\r\nShe is also grateful to the members of her communal bank for how they welcomed her into the group.  With the 1,000 PEN loans she will be able to fill all the orders she receives at her soda fountain, and will be able to buy wholesale ingredients to make sandwiches and drinks, such as fruit, meat, sausage and sodas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1223817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fruit, meat, sausage and sodas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-24T07:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-23T07:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":110.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":120.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":124.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":128.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":129.31},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":136.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":140.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053756,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-25T03:13:08Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":486691,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda works hard to support her family.

Five years ago she was able to complete construction on her home with quality materials thanks to her parents, who feel very proud to have such a hardworking daughter. Acquiring the land made it possible to produce crops and provide for her family's well-being for the past five years. She started on her own with one of the products in highest demand, cocoa. Since then, thanks to the loans through Kiva partner MFP, she has been able to hire workers as well as purchase fertilizer, with which she started growing commercial-grade products, thus motivating her to expand her plantation. Now she wants more than anything to continue building upon that momentum, since one of her goals is to open a convenience store in her home to keep her parents busy. Among her priorities to start the planting season is to acquire some cocoa plants as well as organic fertilizer, which is indispensable in order to reach the necessary quality for the cocoa buyers. Her seventh loan means more than she can say, and she is always grateful for the opportunity to be a member of MFP, which allows her to work hard with more confidence. She also is very grateful to belong to her community bank since all of her fellow members are very optimistic.

The representative of this group, named Marie Parfaite, is the one whose hand is raised in the photo. This is the second time that this group has asked for financial support from Alid\u00e9 to see an increase in their level of business. \r\n\r\nMarie Parfaite is 54 years old and no longer lives with her husband. She has two children, both of whom are under her care. One goes to school. Marie Parfaite lives alone with her children, and she alone takes care of their needs. Marie Parfaite did not go to school.\r\n\r\nFor about 15 years now Marie Parfaite has been selling shoes by the distribution system. This allows her to meet her and her children's needs without much difficulty.

Abir's most important aim is to provide the best education ever to her children.\r\n\r\nAbir applied for a YOUTH LOAN from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua for the first time, in order to increase her business capital to purchase a newly released jewelry collection. The sales will improve and develop her business a lot, which will reflect positively on both her social and financial situation.\r\n\r\nShe works from home to take good care of her children, and at the same improve their living. She hopes to expand her business one day to open her own shop.

Her customers are people from her neighborhood and university students that stay at the university over lunchtime.\r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a Credikiva, in order to buy ingredients such as different types of tubers, spices, vegetables and meat.

She\u2019s married and has four adult children.  She lives in her own house with her children and grandchildren.  She works hard to earn income needed to improve her quality of life for her family\u2019s benefit.\r\n\r\nBelmira\u2019s main activity is selling fish.  She rises very early every day to head to her city\u2019s small fishing port to buy the best, fresh, good-size fish.  When she has all the fish, she separates them by species and size, determines a fair price and sets them up on a table she has in her market stand.  She\u2019s been in this business for more than 40 years and it\u2019s her only source of income.  She always works alone and works all morning.  She affirms that sometimes she feels like she\u2019s taken some step backwards because of the intense, suffocating morning heat.  However, she knows that she has to work to meet her needs.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s now considered the possibility of selling bananas because she insists that they are the best nutritional accompaniment for fish and also because her own customers are requesting said product.  To do so, she needs to have the necessary capital and get to work.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth MFP loan and she\u2019s very at ease because of the great support she\u2019s getting because she feels that she will provide family, economic and personal progress this way; she will emerge with more self-confidence.  \r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the support she\u2019s gotten from her group and for all the advice her advisor has provided.  This motivates her to continue striving to make all her installment payments punctually.\r\n\r\nThe requested 1,500 sol loan is to buy fish and several bunches of bananas.  Her daily investment can be up to 200 soles depending on market prices since the wholesale price of these products may vary.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1224686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-24T18:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-23T18:20:20Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":229.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":237.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":246.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":248.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":265.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":273.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":229.15,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":236.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447774,"comment":null},{"amount":95.08,"local_amount":237.69,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":245.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053759,"comment":null},{"amount":98.62,"local_amount":246.55,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":254.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188691,"comment":null},{"amount":99.3,"local_amount":248.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":256.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572603,"comment":null},{"amount":106,"local_amount":265.01,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":273.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122262,"comment":null},{"amount":109.34,"local_amount":273.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":282.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868083,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

","en":"Adolat is a woman of 52 years. She is married and has two children. She is a teacher at the local school. She has been a client of our organization since 2009 and has not once violated the loan terms, and has shown herself from a very good side. \r\n\r\nAt the time of the previous loan, Adolat married away her eldest son. She hosted an event at the birth of her grandson. This next loan she wants to take for the upcoming wedding of her daughter.

A esta cultura pertenece Margarita, emprendedora como toda su gente, tiene 26 a\u00f1os es soltera, aprob\u00f3 la educaci\u00f3n secundaria y vive con sus padres. Viven juntos en la Parroquia San Rafael que se encuentra en el Cant\u00f3n Otavalo de la Provincia de Imbabura. Otavalo es una ciudad muy atractiva por la diversidad de su cultura por lo que es muy concurrida por turistas nacionales y extranjeros quienes en cada visita disfrutan de paisajes, fiestas coloridas y las costumbres de sus habitantes ind\u00edgenas y mestizos que provienen de legendarias historias y que han defendido su territorio desde siempre. Es un cant\u00f3n muy rico econ\u00f3micamente pues desde sus antecedentes ancestrales, fue considerado el centro de la industria artesanal y actualmente estos productos son cotizados en todo el mundo.  Tambi\u00e9n el turismo es una industria que aporta a la econom\u00eda de esta ciudad, pues en la zona rural se pueden encontrar r\u00edos, lagos, cascadas, bosques que son muy visitados. Por la afluencia de turistas, comerciantes y habitantes de la ciudad, en el centro de la ciudad se puede encontrar gran variedad de negocios que tienen el objetivo brindar todos los servicios para quienes pasan por la ciudad, estos negocios var\u00edan entre hoteles, hostales, restaurantes, cafeter\u00edas, papeler\u00edas, tiendas de ropa, alquiler de computadores, internet, etc. \nMargarita, aprendi\u00f3 de sus abuelos y padres a elaborar esteras, ventiladores y varios productos elaborados con paja de forma artesanal. Lleva en este negocio 7 a\u00f1os y lo realiza de forma ambulante en el centro de la ciudad para llamar la atenci\u00f3n de turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de estos productos. Uno de sus sue\u00f1os es convertirse en una microempresaria de \u00e9xito y dar a conocer en todo el mundo estos bienes artesanales que forman parte importante de su cultura. Como primer paso Margarita quiere rentar un local en el que pueda ofrecer su mercader\u00eda y al mismo tiempo se dedique a la elaboraci\u00f3n de estas artesan\u00edas, para lo cual ha asumido la responsabilidad de solicitar un cr\u00e9dito en donde adem\u00e1s pueda aprender sobre la adecuada administraci\u00f3n de su negocio. Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa cuyo objetivo es acabar con la pobreza en el pa\u00eds, brind\u00f3 el apoyo a Margarita y ella asegura que su estilo de vida mejorar\u00e1 con el incremento de ingresos por las ventas que realizar\u00e1 en su nuevo local. ","en":"Struggling to preserve their culture and identity, the Otavalo Indians have maintained their customary language, clothing, and crafts. Margarita belongs to this culture. Like the rest of her people, she is full of drive. She is 26 years old and single. She finished high school and lives with her parents in San Rafael parish, which is in Otavalo Canton, province of Imbabura. \r\n\r\nOtavalo is a very attractive city due to its diverse culture. It is highly visited by domestic and foreign tourists who enjoy the landscape, the colorful celebrations, and the traditions of its indigenous and mestizo peoples with legendary history and who have always defended their territory. The economy in this canton is very wealthy because even in its ancient past it was considered the center of the handycraft industry and currently these products are valued all over the world. Tourism is another industry that supports this city's economy, because in its rural areas you can find rivers, lakes, waterfalls, and forests that are highly visited. Because of the affluence of tourists, merchants, and townspeople, downtown you can find a great variety of businesses that seek to offer all kinds of services to anyone passing through the city: hotels, inns, restaurants, cafes, news stands, boutiques, Internet cafes and booths, etc. \r\n\r\nMargarita learned how to make mats, fans, and several items out of straw from her grandparents and parents, using traditional methods. She has been in this business for seven years and she works on the streets downtown in order to draw attention from domestic and foreign tourists. She invests at least eight hours a day in making and selling her products. One of her dreams is to become a successful microentrepreneur and show the whole world these traditional crafts which are an important part of her culture. As a first step, Margarita wants to rent a location where she can set up her merchandise for sale and at the same time make her crafts. In order to achieve this, she has taken on the responsibility of requesting a loan. She also wants to learn about how to adequately manage a business. \r\n\r\nFundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, whose goal it is to erradicate poverty throughout the country, has offered Margarita support, and she assures that her living standards will improve thanks to the increased income she will obtain from sales made at her new shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1224744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"to rent a shop
