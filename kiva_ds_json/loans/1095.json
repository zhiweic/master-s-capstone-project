Titin used to be a junior high school teacher and is nowadays housewife.

In this area nobody has potable water from their tap. Many people use well water which is often very dirty. To get safe drinking water people have to buy water which is very expensive. That is why Titin started to sell Nazava Water Filters and so far with great success. Within a month she has ordered 3 times and each time all her filters were sold out very quickly.\n\u201cSelling the Nazava filters for drinking water and for filtering household water for washing and cooking are a very appropriate business opportunity here in Cikarang and surroundings. I hope that using this KIVA loan, I can become the largest agent in the greater Jakarta region\u201d.\nThe KIVA loan allows Titin to save on shipping costs, enables her to expand more quickly and will therefore provide more people with safe and affordable drinking water.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1329866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to expand water filter sales and increase the access to safe and affordable drinking water in Cikarang, West Java, Indonesia.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cikarang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2013-04-10T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-10T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Titin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":666.67,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-30T08:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381768365,"comment":null},{"amount":1333.33,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T09:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400266332,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T00:18:36Z","paid_date":"2013-09-19T09:11:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":546355,"name":"Assatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Assatu is 27 years old and lives in West Point, one of the most populated and well-known market areas in Montserrado county.

She is married and has a young son. She lives with her husband and son at her in-laws' house. Her works consists of selling sweet treats; she sells her products door-to-door, and also has, on occasion, sold them from home, where she displays them on a table. She sells products such as sweets, cookies and gum. She is well-known for her charisma and sunny disposition, which have helped her sell her products and thus gather the economic revenue that she needs. She started this line of work 5 years ago as she wanted to be independent and to help with the family's daily expenses. When she first started her business, she felt very shy to be doing this kind of work; but with time, she was able to develop the personal qualities called for and she now generates a lot of sales and is very happy to do so. What she likes best about her work is talking with clients and getting them to laugh; she thinks the most difficult part of the business is having to sell when it is very hot outside.

Dominican Republic, surrounded by mountains and lush vegetation.\r\n\r\nMaria is running a business selling clothing, cosmetics, shoes and other products. She is the mother of a child, and she lives with her child's father. She tells us that her most difficult challenge is to have a successful business. She is dreaming to have a very large general store in her community, a store where she can sell to wholesalers. Her most favorite activity is attending to her business. This is her 14th loan, after having repaid her previous loans satisfactorily.

Most of them started to leave when they were very young, even migrating to Argentina, in search of better living conditions.  As he was the oldest brother left, he started when he was very little to help his father with the farming and the dairy cows.  Therefore, he did not finish high school.  \n\nAt his older siblings\u2019 insistence, he even went for a few years to Argentina.  However, upon his father\u2019s death he had to return to Bolivia and start a new life with his future wife.  Taking advantage of the land he inherited from his father, he decided to work as a farmer and milk producer.  \n\nUpon noticing that there is a great demand for this product, he is prepared to invest and devote himself exclusively to this field.  However, he needs a little more capital.  He will use the loan to buy two head of dairy cows from his brother who wants to sell them because he is

Teresa sews items by request and makes alterations such as fixing hems, putting in zippers and\/or buttons. She makes blouses, pants, skirts, shorts, and shirts, as well as items such as curtains and sheets, etc. Teresa has run her business out of her home for the past 5 years. She took a course on making clothing through a program of her local government, and learned how to make alterations. In colder weather, Teresa makes knitted sweaters, hats, scarves, gloves, capes, and knitted blouses. In warmer weather, such as now, she is taking orders for blouses from thin fabrics and capri pants. Teresa is asking for this loan in order to buy fabrics of different colors and textures, thread, yarns, hooks, buttons, zippers, needles, etc. She says that this loan will help her very much with her business by allowing her to complete several requested orders and by having the capital that will make her able to offer items for sale to her clients.

She is from a city that is full of art, although it is not very well known. Since she was little she liked art, drawing and creatively observing any surroundings. Her primary school wasn't very good, since she had to travel from town to town due to violence. She stopped drawing for awhile and started to worry more because there wasn't anything to eat. She is displaced from a sparsely populated town where the guerillas rule and has taken refuge with her mother and two siblings in an old house with no utilities. The violence hasn't made them them leave there. \r\n\r\nThat was when she started to like less realistic drawings with mysterious details. When she was little she she didn't feel it was abnormal to run from one place to another or to hide or have no financial stability. To the contrary, she thought it was all an adventure or at least she wouldn't show any sadness. It was something that she was raised with and these unlucky events taught them how to be good people. They personally determined that they would keep whatever good thing each event would show. Her story is long and she has lived a lot for her age, but this is just a chapter that will be seen and from that her biggest wishes and dreams are to express her life in an artistic and adventurous

She wants Kiva to give her this big help because at this time she has no financial stability. It has become a little difficult to pay for college since she has to help her mother with the household responsibilities. Her mother doesn't have a job because she is elderly and it is very difficult to find her one, especially since she doesn't have much experience. For these reasons the payment has been a little difficult but when she found out about this agreement she was very happy. This is an opportunity that is seldom seen. In addition her eagerness to get ahead has given her more strength to not ignore her studies and keep fighting for her dreams. Sometimes you feel defeated by things that happen but God helps everyday to have more strength and get up eager to keep fighting for her goals. She also has the encouragement that her mother gives her. It's because of her that she is studying to get her ahead so she can make her proud and have a calm life. You have to have a humble and simple life. That is how we will be great human beings professionally, at work, and spiritually. Never stop fighting and showing the world that you want to get ahead.

cargo de su vida con el apoyo de su abuela materna, en una ciudad peque\u00f1a no importa la edad solo importa las ganas de trabajar para emplear a alguien y eso le sucedi\u00f3 a ella entonces se vio obligada a dejar sus estudios en el colegio y ponerse a trabajar dure as\u00ed un a\u00f1o mientras se repon\u00eda de todos los da\u00f1os que este se\u00f1or le hab\u00eda causado en cuesti\u00f3n de ropa, libros del colegio y calzado, entre otros luego de ese tiempo decidi\u00f3 ingresar a estudiar validando los dos a\u00f1os que le faltaban (d\u00e9cimo y once), con el dinero que se ganaba compro los \u00fatiles, uniformes y matricula, acorde con el jefe en ese entonces que la dejara trabajar hasta las seis de la tarde para entrar al colegio a las seis treinta  acepto y as\u00ed logro estudiar y trabajar seis meses porque resulta que al se\u00f1or  no le serv\u00eda que ella se fuera tan temprano pues su jornada normal era de todo el d\u00eda. Sigui\u00f3 estudiando con lo poco que le pod\u00eda ayudar su abuela y culmino exitosa mente el bachiller, se mudo a una ciudad  en el 2006, para ese tiempo ten\u00eda 16 a\u00f1os  quer\u00eda trabajar pero era m\u00e1s complicado que en su pueblo,  aun as\u00ed lo consigui\u00f3 con un amigo  que ten\u00eda un local peque\u00f1o donde vend\u00eda gorras y correas all\u00ed conoci\u00f3 a la persona que ahora es su esposo e iniciaron una bonita relaci\u00f3n, su  anhelo siempre ha sido seguir estudiando porque ella ha tenido muy claro que es lo \u00fanico que ayuda a salir adelante, ingreso a un instituto  estudio un semestre de secretariado y tuvo que retirarse por que resulto embarazada y su embarazo era de alto riesgo, conformo su hogar con el padre de la ni\u00f1a y se dedico a las cosas de la casa y no estudiaba  por cuesti\u00f3n de dinero, tampoco trabajaba por estar con la bebe (actualmente una ni\u00f1a de 5 a\u00f1os), en la actualidad est\u00e1 estudiando gracias a Dios y al esfuerzo que est\u00e1n haciendo pues vivir  tres con un solo salario es complicado  pero se sabe que es una gran inversi\u00f3n para las vidas teniendo en cuenta una oferta laboral mejor remunerada, un ingreso m\u00e1s alto, en la casa no tienen  mucho hay veces que se ven alcanzados ya que no tiene para la mensualidad pero confiamos en Dios y eso les da aliento para confiar que todo estar\u00e1 mejor.

Her mother lived with him after the baby was born but five years later they got divorced because of his bad behavior.  He did not feed them and was abusive.  Her mother decided give herself another opportunity for love and she took her daughter to live with another man who apparently loved them.  After six long years of living with this man, his bad intentions toward her made life impossible, so at age 13 she decided to live her own life with the support of her maternal grandmother.  In a small city, it is not the age that matters but rather the determination to work, so this is why she left school and started to work.  She lasted a year doing this while recovering from the harm this man had caused her, in matters of clothing, text books, and shoes, among other things.  After that she decided to go back to school to finish the two years she needed for high school (10th and 11th grades).  She used the money she had earned to buy supplies and uniforms and pay for tuition.  Her boss allowed her to quit work at 6:00 p.m. so that she could go to school at 6:30 p.m.  She was able to study and work for six months, but her boss finally said she was leaving too early at a job that was supposed to last all day.\r\n\r\nShe continued her studies with the help of her grandmother and finished high school successfully.  She moved to another city in 2006 at age 16 and wanted to work but it was more complicated than in her town.  But she was able to get a job through a friend who had a small hat and belt business.  There she met the person who is now her husband and they began a nice relationship.  She always wanted to continue studying because she felt that was the only way to get ahead.  She began secretarial studies at an academy but had to quit because she got pregnant and it was a high risk pregnancy.  She set up house with the father of her daughter and began to take care of the home and could not continue studying due to financial reasons.  Nor could she work because of the baby (who is now five years old).  Thankfully, she is studying again through much effort because it is difficult for three people to live off of one income.  But she knows it is a great investment for their lives because there will be more well-paid work on offer.  Sometimes there is not enough money at home and they cannot even afford the monthly rent, but they trust in God and that helps them believe things will get better.  She has a very united, caring family who she works hard for.  She values the opportunity to study and to enjoy every day she has with her daughter.  She tries to teach her that one much fight for one's goals without hurting anyone along the way."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1329117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Together, they live in a wooden house.  From a young age, she was taught different agricultural tasks and work related to the production of cacao and organic coffee, this being the main livelihood of her family.  As the years passed and she married her husband, she was able to become independent through the support of her parents; they offered her an inheritance of some plots of land for the maintenance of her own family.  \r\n\r\nShe had been in this business for almost four years, but in having a young daughter, she decided to start a small business selling carbonated drinks, snacks, and other items, near a court where people play sports in her neighborhood.  She hopes that her neighbors will be her main customer base.  In this way, she hopes to put in the effort now in order to achieve a better quality of life in the long-run, her final objective being to open a larger foods store.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva, which she says is a good tool for work.  She hopes that in her first opportunity, she will receive 1,500 soles, which she will invest in the purchase of snacks, crackers, rehydration beverages and carbonated drinks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1329168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy snacks, crackers, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-11T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-11T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":165.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":181.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":187.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":187.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":206.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":211.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.12},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.12,"local_amount":160.29,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":165.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578123,"comment":null},{"amount":66.04,"local_amount":165.11,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":170.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530358,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":181.79,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":187.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975386,"comment":null},{"amount":75.1,"local_amount":187.77,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":193.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996654,"comment":null},{"amount":74.88,"local_amount":187.19,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:25:07Z","rounded_local_amount":193.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864136,"comment":null},{"amount":80.04,"local_amount":200.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":206.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352499,"comment":null},{"amount":82.68,"local_amount":206.69,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":213.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904325,"comment":null},{"amount":84.42,"local_amount":211.05,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":217.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090416,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T00:28:31Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":546700,"name":"Divino Ni\u00f1o Jesus Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dos de las integrantes de este grupo, han mostrado en su encuentra de eliminaci\u00f3n de pobreza, que tienen un ingreso muy por debajo.

She has two children.  Her eldest, Javier, is 17 years old.  Last year, for financial reasons, she was unable to enroll him in college.  He is currently at home.  With faith and hard work, she hopes that he will be able to start university next semester.  Diana's other son, Oscar, is 4 years old.   He is in pre-school and, thanks to God, he is receiving an education.\r\n\r\nDiana works as a carer in family homes, looking after adults.  However, the work is sporadic.  She lives in a rented apartment and covers all the household expenses herself.  The family don't have any luxuries, nor can Diana give her children things they ask for, but she tries to give them what she can within her means.  They have to miss out on a lot of things and, if they really want something, Diana has to make sacrifices.\r\n\r\nDiana is currently studying in the hopes that she will be able to get ahead and provide a better quality of life for her children and her mother.  Diana's mother, Rocio, is 56 years old.  Owing to her age, Rocio is out of work.  She was a nurse's aide with SENA (the Colombian National Learning Service) but, as a result of her age, the way society is and institutional protocols, she is no longer able to work.  Instead, Rocio helps out with the children while Diana goes out to work and attends college.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Diana separated from her husband because of domestic abuse.  She no longer has any contact with her children's father and he does not help out financially.  Diana has done her best.  This agreement will help her a lot as she will need to help her eldest son with transportation costs when he starts studying in June and she also has household expenses to cover.  Thankfully, the Institution provided the opportunity to attend classes.  She started a little late, when classes had already begun, but thanks to the interest she showed, she is now ahead in her studies and receiving good grades.  She hopes to continue in this way right up until graduation day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1329139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to complete her studies as a nurse's aide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-11T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-11T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":151448.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197716,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":151448.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891043,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":75724.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912452,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":75724.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391557685,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T14:43:26Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":546565,"name":"Narek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Narek is from the Vayots Dzor region.

They live together in their own home which is made from solid building materials.\r\n\r\nLucia's business is farming.  She grows organic cacao.  In order to keep her business running smoothly, she must always have capital available so that she can hire local laborers in order to help with tasks such as weeding, pruning and harvesting.  Organic cacao is a product whose profitability varies according to its quality.  For this reason, it is essential that Lucia constantly provides adequate care for her crops.

donde generalmente las personas se dedican al cultivo de ma\u00edz. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron  porque en la comunidad donde viven hay un banco donde se extrae la piedra la cual se utiliza para construcci\u00f3n de las viviendas.\nTere quien es integrante del grupo cuenta que tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad vive en uni\u00f3n libre con Iv\u00e1n desde hace siete a\u00f1os  quien es alba\u00f1il, juntos han formado una familia con un ni\u00f1o que se encuentra estudiando su educaci\u00f3n primaria. Tere se dedica a la venta de productos de belleza desde hace cinco a\u00f1os, Tere comenta \"Inicie con la venta de mis productos de belleza porque una se\u00f1ora venia a mi casa a ofrecerme los mismos cosm\u00e9ticos y ropa, esta misma persona fue quien me motivo para iniciar con mi propio negocio\". Adem\u00e1s, es una actividad que le permite a Tere estar con su ni\u00f1o sin tener que descuidarlo por mucho tiempo por lo que tambi\u00e9n puede ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de su hijo. Tere pl\u00e1tica que en las tardes y cuando est\u00e1 en sus ratos libres visita a sus vecinas para poder ofrecerle  sus productos para tambi\u00e9n mostrarles sus folletos. Esta Vez Tere est\u00e1 solicitando cr\u00e9dito a la instituci\u00f3n para comprar m\u00e1s cosm\u00e9ticos y perfumes que le han solicitado sus clientas. La \u00fanica dificultad que est\u00e1 presentando Tere es cuando algunas se retrasan con los pagos lo que se le dificulta poder cubrir cubrir su cuota que paga quincenalmente de ah\u00ed en fuera nada grave, esto a Tere no le impide tener sue\u00f1os \"Quiero que alg\u00fan d\u00eda mi hijo termine una carrera profesional que m\u00e1s le agrade y le permita tener una mejor calidad de vida\" Aunque sabe que para lograr esto ella tiene que tener un mejor ingreso por lo que quiere estudiar computaci\u00f3n piensa conseguirlo mediante su negocio. Tere tiene metas, as\u00ed como el resto de los integrantes del grupo es por eso que est\u00e1n solicitando cr\u00e9dito a la instituci\u00f3n para poder invertirle a sus negocios Como Don Mario y Mar\u00eda Alberta invertir\u00e1 en sus tienda de abarrotes, Laura, Francisca, Rosa, Basilia, invertir\u00e1n en cr\u00eda y engorda de borregos, por eso ellos est\u00e1n muy contentos y agradecidos con Vision Fund y KIVA por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado.\n","en":"The group Banco de Piedra (Stone Bank) is made up of seven members; they live in a very quiet community where the people generally make a living in growing corn.  They selected this name for their group because in the community where they live, there is a bank where the people extract stone; they then use this stone to construct their homes.\n\nTeresa is the featured member of this group.  She is twenty-eight years old and has lived in a common-law marriage with Iv\u00e1n for seven years.  Iv\u00e1n is a bricklayer.  Together, they have formed a family with one son; he is studying in primary school.  Tere has made a living in selling beauty products for five years.  She says: \"I began selling beauty products because a woman came to my house and offered me these same cosmetics and clothes.  This same person was the individual who motivated me to start my own business.\"  Furthermore, this activity allows Tere to be with her son without having to leave him alone for a lot of time.  She is also able to help her husband with the home expenses and with her son's education.  Tere says that in the afternoons and in her free moments, she visits with her female neighbors in order to offer them her products and to also show them her brochures.  \n\nThis time, Tere is requesting a loan in order to buy more cosmetics and perfumes that her clients have requested.  The only difficulty that Tere deals with is when some clients get behind with their payments; this makes it hard for her to be able to cover her own payments that she makes every two weeks.  From there on out, it's nothing too serious.\n\nThis doesn't prevent Tere from having dreams: \"One day, I want my son to finish his studies for a profession that he likes and that will allow him to have a better quality of life.\"  She knows that in order to achieve this, she has to have a higher income, since her son wants to study computer science.

She has been married for 27 years to Miguel who works as a laborer. Together they have six children, but only two are still dependent. Feliza has been raising pigs for 27 years. She says, \u201cI started raising pigs when my husband wasn't working and all of our children were in school. We had many expenses so I wanted to help my husband with the household expenses.\u201d \nFeliza is requesting a loan to buy feed for her piglets so they can continue their healthy growth. She says that she buys piglets when they are very small and raises and fattens them to sell. Her neighbors generally check in with her to find out when her pigs are developed enough to sell. Her one challenge is paying for feed for her piglets. \nHer dream is for her children to have a better future and to become professionals.  Like Feliza, the other members have dreams and will invest their loans in their businesses.

This is 43-year-old Ledwin from Masvingo. She is married and has three children, all of whom are attending school. She also cares for one dependent. \r\n\r\nLedwin runs an agriculture business of selling chickens. The business has been in operation for 10 years.

bonita tiene a su esposo y su hija de 9 a\u00f1os.\nSiempre le ha gustado estudiar, sus padres Joaquin y Patricia le dieron la oportunidad de cursar sin ning\u00fan contratiempo la primaria y el bachillerato de los que tiene recuerdos muy gratos como, ser una muy buena alumna, haber participado en diversas actividades deportivas, en danzas, banda marcial ,etc. sus padres a pesar de ser separados hace mucho tiempo le inculcaron valores muy importantes como: apreciar todo lo que la vida le pueda ofrecer, as\u00ed mismo ella sigui\u00f3 sus estudios y presento ex\u00e1menes de admisi\u00f3n en la universidad Aut\u00f3noma para seguir con la carrera profesional de Odontolog\u00eda donde tuvo \u00e9xito y pudo empezar sus estudios como ella lo hab\u00eda so\u00f1ado; sin embargo como la vida suele tener altibajos su mama cabeza de familia de cuatro hijos  quien era la proveedora econ\u00f3mica de su estudio no pudo seguir apoy\u00e1ndola y as\u00ed ella dejo de estudiar  odontolog\u00eda.\nMas adelante ella misma con sus ingresos laborales pago y realizo  una serie de diplomados para  poder mejorar de alguna manera su perfil laboral y acad\u00e9mico, Caterine nunca dejo de tener como meta terminar sus estudios o cursar una carrera profesional as\u00ed que como muchos en esta vida trabaja junto con su esposo fuertemente para poder estudiar Contabilidad financiera. Ella sabe que poco a poco, pelda\u00f1o por pelda\u00f1o se llega a la sima y que con el apoyo de su familia y el empe\u00f1o que ella le ponga, su sue\u00f1o finalmente se har\u00e1 realidad.\nUna de las cosas mas importantes para Caterine es mostrarle a su hija y a muchos que la edad  y los hijos no son inconvenientes para llegar a la meta.\nElla sabe que con el pasar del tiempo y con la experiencia que dan los a\u00f1os pudo enfocarse con mayor seriedad y responsabilidad en lo que hoy es su prioridad despu\u00e9s de su familia y es llegar a obtener la tarjeta profesional no en odontolog\u00eda como ella escogi\u00f3 en un principio sino como contadora y especializarse en finanzas, como su vida y vivencias le han mostrado que es lo que realmente ella sabe hacer. \nElla sin duda alguna da gracias por que ha disfrutado la vida de manera que no se arrepiente de todo lo que ha hecho  que sin duda alguna la han formado en su car\u00e1cter, responsabilidad, respeto y conciencia. Caterine solo espera poder contar con salud, una mejor\u00eda econ\u00f3mica y laboral para llegar a su nueva meta pero no al final de su vida; ya que piensa que tiene muchos sue\u00f1os por cumplir y muchas metas por alcanzar, sin duda alguna ella y su gran coraz\u00f3n la llevaran muy lejos.\n ","en":"Caterine has lived in the city for ten years; she\u2019s an enterprising woman who very much wants to get ahead.  She has a lovely family: a husband and a nine-year-old daughter.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s always enjoyed studying.  Her parents, Joaqu\u00edn and Patricia, gave her the opportunity to attend elementary and high school problem-free and she has very pleasant memories of those days like being a very good student, of participating in various sports activities, in dances, in the marching band, etc.  Despite her parents being separated, they always instilled in her very important values like the appreciation for everything life can provide for her.  She continued her studies and took the admission tests for the Autonomous University to continue a professional career in dentistry where she was successful and was able to start her studies like she wanted to.  However, as life is wont to do, there were highs and lows.  Her mother, who was head of household with four children and provided economically for her studies, was unable to continue doing so and she had to drop out of the dentistry program.\r\n\r\nLater on with her own income earned at work she took a series of courses to be able to improve her work and academic profiles.  Caterine never stopped aiming at finishing her studies leading to a professional degree so like many others she works hard alongside her husband in order to be able to study financial accounting.  She knows that little by little, climbing up step by step, one reaches the summit and that with support from her family and the effort she herself puts into it her dream will finally become reality.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things for Caterine is to show her daughter and many others that age and having children is no obstacle to reach one\u2019s goals.\r\n\r\nShe knows that with the passage of time and with the experience years provides one can focus more seriously and responsibly on what one's priorities are today which besides her family are to attain her professional degree not in her original choice of dentistry perhaps but as an accountant specializing in finance which life and her life experiences have shown her to be what she\u2019s really good at.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, she\u2019s thankful for everything she\u2019s enjoyed in life and she does not regret anything she\u2019s done for it has all led to forming her character: responsibility, respect and conscience.\r\n\r\nCaterine only hopes to be in good health and to improve her economy and her work so that she can reach a new goal.  But this isn\u2019t the end; she believes she still has many dreams to reach and many goals to attain.

She also makes products derived from wheat flour and sells breakfasts every day. With these diverse activities she generates additional income to benefit her household, which includes her husband and their 2 children, ages 11 and 28 years.\r\n\r\nJudith's goal is to achieve an increase in their incomes and, further along, to have a place with more ample space in which to live. She wishes to get ahead together with her husband and her 11-year-old son. Judith's major challenge is competition, since the competitors in her market are able to buy in larger volume, obtaining better prices. She must replace her merchandise continuously and her small quantities don't merit competitive prices. This is Judith's justification for approaching Kiva, to request her 1st financing through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo.

He still had no future plans and no clear goal to follow or fight for. His friends told him to study a degree related to biology, while his parents wanted him to study engineering because it was the career of the future which would give him the most money. He came to understand a famous phrase during this period of his life: \"Stand up for your family.\" Since he was the first person in his family who would go on to higher education, he took on responsibility and had the eyes of everyone on his family on him. In 2011, he started a degree in Industrial Engineering at the University of La Salle. From the beginning, he knew very well that it was not what he really wanted to study, but he had a clear goal: to stand up for his family.\r\n\r\nIn late 2012, he made a decision that changed his life, for that moment and forever. He made a 180-degree turn and turned everything upside down. This decision had many repercussions, because for obvious reasons his parents decided not to support him with his studies any longer. Therefore, he started to work in a pre-university institution so that he could pay for a degree that he really wanted with his own resources. It took him a long time to realize that healthcare was the field that he really liked and that he was passionate about: that indescribable feeling of helping people when they need it, helping someone when their life may be at risk, taking care of a patient both physically and psychologically with all of their needs in order to obtain a quick and satisfactory recovery, and many other aspects. This is what he really enjoys and provides his main motivation to study something related to the healthcare field.\r\n\r\nHis dream, or his hope, at this moment is to study and to fill himself with all of the knowledge that he needs to help other people. One of his goals is to be able to study medicine. However, since he does not have the necessary resources to study that degree, at this moment he is studying nursing because he didn't want to give up on his career despite the obstacles in his life. If life has taught him anything, it is that everything starts somewhere. It doesn't matter how small or big things are, or how good the studies are, or where one studies. What is important is to know how to take advantage of the situation and to make the most out of it. The most important thing is to keep moving forward without worrying about the obstacles that life gives you."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to finish his nursing assistant studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-11T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-11T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":152040.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197685,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":152040.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891007,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":152040.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845835,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T20:23:47Z","paid_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544608,"name":"Santiago","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santiago vive con su madre (M\u00f3nica)  sus hermanos (Isabella y Felipe) por lo general considera que tiene una familia humilde que se rebusca la vida trabajando juntos para llegar a un futuro bueno se ven mucho problemas econ\u00f3micos como siempre pero no se dan por vencidos es una persona respetuosa sincera humilde y responsable que sabe valorar las cosas y que no se da por vencido \n\nEn el transcurso de su vida ha visto que es la vida real estudio en colegios tanto p\u00fablicos como privados y Sali\u00f3 adelante con la primaria y bachillerato  trabajo en diferente sitios para apoyar a su familia mientras consegu\u00eda la posibilidad de estudiar.

He's 48 years old. His wife doesn't work but stays at home taking care of their children.\r\nAfter graduating high school, Abdurasul attended vocational college and then driving school. While going to these schools, he worked as a mechanic in a body shop. However, the body shop closed and Abdurasul was forced to leave the work he was attached to and enjoyed a great deal. \r\nUsing the money he saved up during college, Abdurasul bought a car and started working as a cab driver. It's not an easy job because Abdurasul doesn't have regular work hours and sometimes works at night. \r\nEverything Abdurasul does is focused on completing the dream of his children receiving a prestigious education and finding better work opportunities. \r\nOn his friends advice, Abdurasul approached MDO \"Arvand\" with a request for a loan. This new capital will allow him to improve his vehicle and purchase some spare parts. \r\nAbdurasul is very thankful to organizations such as \"Arvand\" which enable people in difficult financial situations to achieve their goals.

de vida claro, de la cual ella y toda la familia pudieran estar orgullosos, como era peque\u00f1o no cre\u00eda que lo que ellos le ped\u00edan fuera gran cosa, pero a medida que pasaba el tiempo se iba dando cuenta de lo dif\u00edcil que puede llegar a ser ese tipo de persona del cual se pudiera estar orgulloso, pero deb\u00eda lograrlo para no decepcionar ni dejar atr\u00e1s todo el esfuerzo que su madre y  familia hicieron siempre para que el lograra esto.\nSiempre trataba de tener buenas notas en el colegio y ser un alumno destacado no solo por conocimiento, sino tambi\u00e9n por colaboraci\u00f3n frente a los profesores, compa\u00f1eros incluso con la instituci\u00f3n.

He grew up seeing his mother work long workdays to provide everything he needed like good education, clothing, food and things that perhaps he undervalued back then.  She never asked for much in return for everything she did for him every day.  All she wanted was for him to become a professional, enterprising person once he grew up with a clear life plan that she and the entire family could be proud of.  Because he was little, he didn\u2019t think that what they were asking of him was very much but as time passed he realized how difficult it is to become the type of person that one can be proud of.  But, he had to accomplish this in order not to disappoint and waste the efforts his mother and family always made so that he could attain this.\r\n\r\nHe always strove to get good grades at school and to be an outstanding student not only because of his knowledge but also because of his cooperation with teachers and classmates and even with the school itself so that his mother and family, but especially her, would proudly receive his grades and the sincere congratulations he\u2019d get from his teachers.\r\n\r\nThanks to all this, he gradually realized that what he liked best was to help people to the extent he was able to do so.  Thanks to his good grades he had good analytic, responsibility, cooperation and collaboration skills.  Putting all his knowledge and skills into practice he could be of great help to those who need it, including his mother, and this is why from the age of 16 on whenever he had school vacation or had some other opportunity to work he\u2019d do so in whatever was available to help her with expenses.  This was something she valued highly.  Even though he wasn\u2019t all that good at some things, he always did even the impossible in order to do things well and be able to help her.\r\n\r\nAs time passed and he continued to grow he needed to decide what he was going to do with his life to reach the only goal he had at the moment: to make sure that all his mother\u2019s labor had not been in vain.  However, to date he had no idea how he was going to accomplish this.  Despite everything, he still did not have a clear idea of what he was going to do with his life or perhaps feared discovering what he really wanted for himself.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of reflection and analysis he started to figure out what he liked best in life: helping people, human compassion, and curiosity to learn more every day and to become a great person to reach a final decision.  These led him to the answer to his question of what he wanted to do with his life: health.\r\n\r\nOnce he made this decision things weren\u2019t as easy as he thought they\u2019d be or as he\u2019d imagined because he lacked sufficient economic resources to study medicine.  Because of this and in order not to set his dreams and goals aside, he decided to study nursing to start a career in the health field so that in a short period of time and with his own resources he\u2019d be able to pay for the career he\u2019s so passionate about and he\u2019s never stopped dreaming about and has always kept fixed on his horizon: Medicine.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1328433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to finish his nursing course.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-11T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-11T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter Gabriel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197700,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-07T10:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891022,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391557683,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T21:37:45Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545269,"name":"Digna Emerita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Digna tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera, tiene 2 hijos con los cuales vive en el Municipio de la M\u00e1sica, San Juan Pueblo.\n Desde hace 4 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de comida que ella misma prepara como ser, pastelitos rellenos de arroz y carne, baleadas, tajadas con carne molida, refrescos, golosinas.

She lives with her sister and mother.  Currently she is studying toward a technical professional degree in financial accounting.  All of her life she has lived with her mother, and she is the person who has taken care of her since she was born and given her everything she has needed so far.  She is an independent woman who works at a bakery.  The truth is that her income is not high enough to continue paying an expense as large as Cindy's school fee.  Since her mother is older, Cindy is trying to get a job that would help her, since she is a single mother of two daughters who have various expenses.  With this, she would help pay for her studies and share some of the expenses.\n\nTwo years ago, she was part of a program that offered techniques for competence in the workforce.  She signed up and thanks to this program, she was able to increase her knowledge of everything that has to do with a career in public accounting.  A year ago, she worked at a corporation to expand her knowledge.  She liked it since it provided a high quality of learning and accommodated her as a person.  Now that she has the opportunity to do something for her well-being she does not want to abandon it so that she can help her mother.  \n\nChanging topics, she likes sports and exercising.  She also likes to read, help at home, and participate in theater shows or anything that has to do with culture and arts in general.  She would like to be part of an academy and study scenic arts in the future so that she could be an actress and a professional accountant recognized as an enterprising woman with an intense need to help the most needy in Colombia.  She could start a foundation so that many people could work together to support the future of her

crecer profesionalmente pero realmente en su casa no hab\u00edan  los recursos suficientes para poder estudiar en una Universidad y menos si es una carrera como la ella  quer\u00eda. Al salir del colegio por ser menor de edad no consegu\u00eda trabajo, pero una vecina le ayudo y logro trabajar en unas cabinas entre semana de y los fines de semana decidi\u00f3 entrar a estudiar enfermer\u00eda auxiliar con su trabajo se pagaba la carrera pues claro que la plata no alcanzaba pero se hac\u00eda rendir de una u otra manera, al realizar sus practicas y graduarse de enfermera  trabajo con una familia cuidando un en cama. La vida le cambio a por completo cuando empieza a trabajar y empieza a darse gustos tal vez de cosas muy peque\u00f1as pero al fin son gustos. Al finalizar el a\u00f1o llega la noticia que nadie espera pero que todos saben que va a llegar. Su padre fallece, el gran y \u00fanico compa\u00f1ero de su madre, mientras todos sal\u00edan a trabajar y as\u00ed ayudarse entre todos para los gatos de la casa. No basto con la muerte de su papa, su mama entra  en una depresi\u00f3n que ya no quer\u00eda hacer nada ni por salud de ella, decidi\u00f3 renunciar  a su trabajo para estar con ella en la casa acompa\u00f1arla y poderla ayudar a salir de esa tan fuerte depresi\u00f3n segu\u00eda en su cargo de enfermera pero en turnos de noche nada c\u00f3modo pero feliz porque estaba trabajando y creciendo profesionalmente, en julio a su mama le da una trombosis cerebral enfermedad que la impide hacer ciertas actividades por ella misma. Desde aquella enfermedad queda con terapias con apoyo psicol\u00f3gico y afrontando su depresi\u00f3n, meses despu\u00e9s le diagnostican Artrosis Degenerativa, enfermedad que aun no tiene cura para ser m\u00e1s exactos ya no es la misma la alegr\u00eda que caracterizaba ya no se le nota, motivo por el cual evita no alejarse tanto de casa para estar pendiente de ella. Su abuela materna que ha vivido toda la vida con ellos les ayuda y estaba pendiente de su hija y de los nietos, pero a su larga edad  las enfermedades y los achaques empiezan a aparecer, le realizan una cirug\u00eda de urgencia de alto riesgo pues su sistema digestivo no le quiso funcionar mas. Resumiendo su historia ni su mama, ni su abuela son las misma ambas est\u00e1n enfermas y Jenny est\u00e1 a cargo de ellas claro que entre los hermanos se colaboran pero al vivir con ellas dos siente m\u00e1s responsabilidad velar por su bienestar.

She finished and was eager to go to school and grow professionally but really in her home there weren't enough resources to go to college, much less for a major like the one she wanted. When she left high school, since she was a minor she couldn't get a job, but a neighbor helped her and she was able to work in some telephone booths weekdays. She decided to go to school to become an assistant nurse on the weekends and paid for it with her work. Of course, there wasn't enough money, but she made it work one way or another. \n\nWhen she did her internship and graduated as a nurse, she worked with a family caring for a bedridden patient. Life changed completely when she started to work and she began to take small pleasures, but they were pleasures. When the year ended she received the news that no body is expecting but that everyone knew would come. Her father died, the wonderful sole companion of her mother while they all worked to help each other with the household expenses. As if the death of her father weren't enough, her mother entered into a depression and didn't want to do anything for her own health. Jenny decided to quit her job to be with her at home, to keep her company and help her overcome this severe depression. She continued in her role as a nurse, but at night. It wasn't easy but she was happy because she was working and growing professionally. In July, her mother had a stroke, an illness that impedes her doing certain activities on her own. Since her mother had that illness, she has had physical therapy and therapy for her depression. Afterwards, she was diagnosed with degenerative osteoarthritis, a disease that has no cure. In short, she doesn't have the same cheerfulness she was known for. For this reason, Jenny tries not to go far from home so she can keep an eye on her. Her maternal grandmother, who has lived with them her whole life, helped them and cared for her daughter and grandchildren, but at her advanced age illness and maladies begin to appear. She had an emergency high risk surgery because her digestive system did not work anymore. To get back to Jenny's story, neither her mother, her grandmother are the same. Both of them are sick and Jenny is in charge of them. All of the siblings cooperate, but living with them, she feels more responsible for their well being. She decided to go to school to learn more and open her own spa. In order to pay for her studies she works a shift, then she goes to school. She picks up two children that she cares for in the afternoon and she helps them with their homework. Then she goes back to the shift and returns home. At that time her mother and a friend help her care for the children while she comes and goes, they have tea, the children leave and she does her homework and makes dinner, puts her mother and grandmother to bed, does housework and gets ready for a new day. On Saturday, she works shifts as a nurse because that day her sisters can take care of the mothers and not leave them alone.\n\nHer biggest motivation are the two of them. they are the reason she gets up every day, thanking God for keeping her healthy so she can continue to work to get ahead and be with them.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1327389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to finish her degree in nursing.

He has 10 years of experience working with livestock.  His father bred livestock and Fatto helped him throughout his childhood.  Now the business is his income, it is how he earns a living. Now grown, he followed in his father's footsteps starting his own business with 5 head of ram.  Starting out was difficult, especially during the winter.  But his years of experience proved useful and he began finding ways to overcome obstacles and improve.  Today, he owns more than 50 rams, and recently he bought a cow.  His wife and 5 children take part as well.  Due to the current season, he cannot sell his rams since prices for them have fallen.  Fatto needs additional funds for feed and to buy new livestock.  With this goal, he turned to Arvand for a loan which he plans to use for these purposes.  He is grateful to Arvand for the support and big role it plays in his life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":231.55,"image":{"id":1328943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-12T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-12T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":103.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":107.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":114.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":126.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":130.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":134.69},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":139.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":143.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":148.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.03},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.52,"local_amount":103.96,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":107.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572702,"comment":null},{"amount":23.27,"local_amount":107.38,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":110.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971474,"comment":null},{"amount":24.03,"local_amount":110.91,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":114.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751993,"comment":null},{"amount":24.82,"local_amount":114.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":118.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616080,"comment":null},{"amount":25.64,"local_amount":118.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":122.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859951,"comment":null},{"amount":26.48,"local_amount":122.22,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":126.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136696,"comment":null},{"amount":27.36,"local_amount":126.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":130.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900892,"comment":null},{"amount":28.25,"local_amount":130.4,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":134.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550073,"comment":null},{"amount":29.18,"local_amount":134.69,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":138.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774298,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T20:06:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":546819,"name":"Phat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A young local farmer from Dambae district of Kampong Cham province, Phat is 19 years old and blessed with one child.

She is married to Eleazar, her husband, and they have 7 children. She has lived with them in a rented house for six years. Early every morning she sells food from a small room that she outfitted in her house, since nights she sells hamburgers. This work is very profitable and she can help with the household expenses. But this isn't the only activity that Nery does. Since she was very young she has worked the soil. When she grew up and started a family she began to rent cropland where she grows beans, peas, and spinach.

Edith makes a living sowing peas, potatoes and corn.  After harvesting them she takes them to the country's capital city, to sell her products to sellers at the central market.  There in Lima, people pay a higher price for Edith's vegetables.  Edith travels to the city at least three times a week and so she hopes to buy a truck in order to reduce her travelling costs.

Regardless of his disability, Metusela is a very economically active member of the community. Metusela is mainly a small-scale farmer who grows vegetables and supplies them in a local market.
