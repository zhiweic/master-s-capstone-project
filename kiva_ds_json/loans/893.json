She lives in Duran with her parents, in a family home which is made from cement and has all basic services.  G\u00e9nesis' business is selling cosmetics through a catalog.  This entrepreneurial young woman tells us that she started her business with the support of a friend who helped her with the registration.  She then set out to learn how to manage her business because, back then, she wanted to earn money for when she gave birth.  Now she knows her business and is doing well in it.\r\n\r\nG\u00e9nesis tells us that the way to make real profits, for her, is not to sell products directly but rather to have a sales network.  A network is when there is one main person who manages the orders, deliveries and payment.  They earn money for every member they have in their network.  G\u00e9nesis currently has 30 people in her network which makes her a lot of profits.  It also has the advantage that she has very little contact with the end customer which reduces her risk of having to deal with people who don't pay.  G\u00e9nesis tells us that she doesn't work fixed hours as she is available whenever people make orders so that she doesn't let her saleswomen down.

Since then, no major changes in business direction have been observed.  Irina continues to lease a space for her business at one of the local markets in the city of Zaporozhye.

He\u2019s been in business six years and it\u2019s been growing step by step.  He recalls that at first he did not have the tools to handle the Tagua pits but he now has machines that make the process easier.  The process consists in collecting, peeling, shaping and drying.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuiterio sells at wholesale and retail. In the photo sacks of material appear that will be used to convert the pits into buttons and artisanal animal figurines.  Because this business is his source of income he works at it only from 7am until 5pm.  Most of his customers are small vendors in the city who sell the products as souvenirs to tourists at the beaches in Manta.

Initially, the business belonged to his sister, who had a well-known workshop frequented by a great number of customers. It was she who first taught him the ropes of the business; later he decided to take some courses to learn about sewing techniques. He discovered that he quite enjoyed sewing, so he decided to expand his sister's workshop. This is the second loan that he has applied for; the first loan was invested in buying a sewing machine. He does not work alone in the business as his sister helps him serve the customers; they work all day from Monday to Sunday as they have a high demand to satisfy, especially during school term times when they manufacture uniforms. His main customers are the schools who request bulk orders of uniforms, as well as private individuals.This particular loan will be used to buy fabrics, threads, buttons and closures for use in his production. Walter hopes that in the future he will increase his sales and be able to buy his own home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1116936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to buy fabrics, threads, buttons and closures.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Libertad","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-03T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-02T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter Gilbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":948.91,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":65.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":71.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":72.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":73.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":76.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":79.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":81},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":82.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":86.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":97.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.07},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.65},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.98,"local_amount":208.74,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":208.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340371,"comment":null},{"amount":74.07,"local_amount":73.99,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":74.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096743,"comment":null},{"amount":76.26,"local_amount":76.17,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":76.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331099,"comment":null},{"amount":77.51,"local_amount":77.42,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":77.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939742,"comment":null},{"amount":79.65,"local_amount":79.56,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":79.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072162,"comment":null},{"amount":81.1,"local_amount":81,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318521,"comment":null},{"amount":82.94,"local_amount":82.85,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":82.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013265,"comment":null},{"amount":85.43,"local_amount":85.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453631,"comment":null},{"amount":184.06,"local_amount":183.85,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":184.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459480,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

His wife tends to the house; they live in the village of Las Pi\u00f1uelas, Catacamas, Olancho. Heriberto has been working in agriculture for nine years: he started with sweetcorn and black beans, and, with time, became more experienced. He now also grows watermelons. He works all day long. An advantage he has is that when the weather is favourable, the crops grow well. Heriberto asks for a loan because he needs the money to buy manure, urea, and chemical fertilisers, and to hire help. The problems he faces have to do with watering the crops (sometimes there is too much water, which is harmful, and sometimes there is not enough water), fighting parasites, and, when the times come to sell the produce, the risk of a drop in prices. His goal is to make his crops grow and to have a harvest in good condition for selling. Heriberto is in his third cycle with field partner FAMA's loans; he has always been punctual with his repayments and the loans he obtained helped him improve his standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1116888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertiliser and to hire help.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Catacamas, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-07-03T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-02T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Heriberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":20007.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981332,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-17T01:48:49Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:26:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":440867,"name":"Thoung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thoung is 30 years old.

widow. She's raised two children and is now caring for her thirteen-year-old nephew. In 1996, searching for a new source of income, she began a farming and animal raising business from a starting capital of 15,000 soms (KGS). Thanks to her hard work and dedication, her business has grown to include 6 cows with offspring, 10 heads of small-horned cattle, 2 horses, 3 hectares of land she uses to grow potatoes and grain crops on and a monthly income of 7,500 soms (KGS) by selling milk. \r\n\r\nHoping to expand to her business even further, Jumagul approached \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" with a request for a loan of 70,000 soms (KGS) in order to purchase some small-horned cattle. She plans to reinvest the profits from the loan back into her business.

When his contract ended he received a settlement, with which he bought a three-wheeled motorcycle and began his job.  He decided on this job because an uncle told him it was profitable and taught him the job.  He works from 7 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon, covering various areas.  He has a microphone to announce the purchase of articles in bad condition.  Then he goes to the collection area and sells it.\r\n\r\nThis is a way to earn his daily living and at the same time help the environment, because of the multiple government campaigns to turn Ecuador into an ecological country.\r\n\r\nThe loan Eduardo is requesting is to have financing to be able to buy the junk.

Cruz has worked as a seamstress since she was 26-years-old, when she graduated from the academy.  She began with a personal sewing machine that she bought from a shopping center on credit, and to make the payments she began to offer her services as a seamstress.  In the beginning, her customers were relatives and friends, but little by little business improved as they spread the word.  Two years ago, she changed houses as she needed a larger place to fit her machines as now she has two sewing machines, an overlock machine, and cutting tables.  With this in mind, she uses the living room of the house for her workshop as now she has a helper and needs the space.  She works Monday through Saturday, all day, and when she has an order to complete, she only rests when she is done because she likes to be punctual.  She mostly makes party dresses, suits, and uniforms; as well as doing repairs on garments if that is asked of her.

She also started going through the areas near her house so that now she\u2019s very well-received.  \r\n\r\nShe tends to her business by herself at all hours taking catalogues and whatever products she has on hand.  She does it this way because she usually buys products that are on sale like perfume and two-for-one make-up, cream and deodorants since they are more economical and she can sell them at their normal price giving small discounts.  \r\n\r\nThis strategy has been very useful because competition is aggressive but she\u2019s managed to retain her customers this way.

She married very young and already has a three-year-old boy whom she takes care of. He does not yet attend school.  Her husband has a barbershop, in which she assists him.  After she got married, she began to enjoy the business and has been working with the aim of meeting her daily expenses.  She has always been an enterprising woman, and she now sells beauty products.\r\n\r\nHer biggest selling items are perfumes, whether they are from Ecuador or other countries.  She obtains the foreign perfumes through a friend who has an export business.  She works all day without rest from 7 in the morning until 9 at night, making her rounds promoting her products or collecting payment from her customers.\r\n\r\nMaria reports that this season has been more difficult since the rains have damaged the streets where she sells her products.  The loan she is seeking is to renovate her husband's barbershop to make space for her to sell her own products there.  The funds will be used to buy glass, cement, sand and stones for the construction.

Micaela Bastida\" (Micaela Bastida's Enterprising Women). The group is composed of 7 members with good ideas for today\u2019s activities. Tereza is a member of the group and hers is a special story of success and progress. Tereza is 54 years old, she is married and she has four children whom she has been able to provide for with the great contribution of the small activity she started more than 25 years ago: she sells spices and dressings. Through this activity she has always succeeded in getting ahead. Thanks to the profits of her shop and to her husband\u2019s help she has succeeded in offering a dignified life to her children and to provide a stable income for her family. The loan she is now requesting will be used to buy dressings. Just like Tereza, every member of the group has a special story, but these all meet in the effort with which they face every challenge coming up in their lives, fighting for the wellbeing of their families as well as for their economic improvements."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4200,"image":{"id":1112906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy dressings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Comas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2012-07-03T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-02T23:50:04Z","loan_amount":4200,"lender_count":124,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tereza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Valentin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Melania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Dorotea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olimpia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1883.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1883.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1883.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1883.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1883.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1883.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":699.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":1883.33,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:19:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1885.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294315502,"comment":null},{"amount":700,"local_amount":1883.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1885.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301372392,"comment":null},{"amount":700,"local_amount":1883.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1885.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308131390,"comment":null},{"amount":700,"local_amount":1883.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1885.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315367299,"comment":null},{"amount":1400,"local_amount":3766.68,"processed_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3770.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322976502,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T16:05:13Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:10:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438536,"name":"Adiela Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adiela es madre soltera cabeza de familia de su hijo ya que su padre los abandon\u00f3 hace un tiempo, y para generar los ingresos que se requieren en su hogar ten\u00eda un empleo hasta hace unas semanas; luego de esto qued\u00f3 desempleada y durante unos d\u00edas logr\u00f3 sostener los gastos de su hogar con los ahorros que ten\u00eda de su empleo, y gracias a que era muy disciplinada con los ahorros tuvo un poco de capital para poder estar bien econ\u00f3micamente durante unos pocos d\u00edas.

She is 20 years old and has been living independently for three years.  She is currently single and does not have any children.  Her business is her sole source of income.  Kiara started working with micro loans at the age of 17, selling products at her high school.  She enjoyed her work and her business was quite popular.  At school, she made her sales through an aunt who was her representative with the company [who provided her products] because she was a minor.  When she went to University, she gathered together some capital and signed up as an independent vendor.  Kiara mentions that, in this type of business, there are no official hours.  She visits her customers when they call her on the phone and arrange a visit.  She travels on buses, carrying the products that she sells in a suitcase.

Four years ago, she bought a house with help from her husband. Juan is Gloria's husband; he's a master builder and has been in this line of work for 12 years. They have three children who go to public school. Gloria's business is pottery, that is to say, she makes ceramic figures to serve as ornaments or souvenirs. She started this business because of a course she took out of curiosity - she enjoyed it a lot and realized that she was skilled at painting. She began by buying the piece and painting it her own way, with guidance from the magazines she got from the lessons she took. In her business, she needs to be open to criticism and know how to take it into account, because customers are not all alike. Currently, she's experienced in this line of work, especially in creating the pieces. There's a process for that: first comes the creation of the piece, made out of kaolin, clay, ashes, powdered silica and lime, which are mixed proportionately to form a paste that's poured into a mold. Secondly, there's the drying in open air, when the piece acquires a more solid consistency that can be manipulated for finishing. Thirdly, the piece is placed in special ovens where it's cooked, and attention is paid so that it doesn't suffer a sudden change in temperature, which could cause it to crack. Then it's left for cooling and painted at will. Certain pieces such as the souvenirs are painted before going into the oven - they demand more delicate handling, but the result is a very eye-catching, beautiful product.

Two of her children have settled for marriage while her other three children are already working.\r\n\r\nMercedes has been involved in a beauty salon business for 20 years. She does not have a fixed stall location where she could have all the equipment needed to provide her services due to the insufficient capital she has. At her age, she aims to have a fixed location for her beauty salon, so that she will no longer perform her services on a house-to-house basis. For this reason, she is asking for a loan of PHP 30,000 allowing her to buy rebonding chemicals, nail cuticle products and nail polish for her beauty salon business. She believes that this loan will help her to obtain greater profits, which will enable her to provide quality service to customers and be able to cover all her household expenses and have a better way

Hace 11 a\u00f1os inicio su taller de confecci\u00f3n de ropa. Aprendi\u00f3 desde muy joven porque su mama se dedicaba a este negocio y fue ella quien le ense\u00f1o corte. Se desempe\u00f1o como su ayudante por varios a\u00f1os aprendiendo no solo la confecci\u00f3n de las prendas sino tambi\u00e9n el trato a los clientes y proveedores. Pasando varios a\u00f1os se independizo al formar su familia empezando a ofrecer sus servicios con una maquina casera de coser. Poco  a poco se fue dando a conocer y ampliar el negocio realizando varios cr\u00e9ditos para poder crecer. Actualmente tiene varias maquinas industriales y realiza confecciones por series, los pedidos se los hacen empresas y consisten en camisas tipo polo bordadas con el logotipo de la misma, pantalones unisex y chalecos este tipo de ropa es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de confeccionar porque se realiza con medidas est\u00e1ndar. Trabaja de lunes a domingo cuando es necesario desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la tarde. Mantiene un horario de trabajo porque tiene un grupo de personas que laboran para \u00e9l.

El mayor problema de Alfredo es enfermarse ya que el conoce todo su negocio y no tendr\u00eda quien lo reemplace pero tiene fe en Dios que le brindara salud y fuerza necesaria para continuar. El pr\u00e9stamo que est\u00e1 solicitando lo empleara en la compra de mercader\u00eda como telas, hilos, botones y dinero para realizar reparaciones a sus maquinas. ","en":"Alfredo lives in Orqu\u00eddeas, where he has a tailoring workshop. At the age of 49, he is a widower and his children are grown. He lives in the northern sector known as Basti\u00f3n Popular, where he has his own home made of cement, with basic utility services. He started his tailoring workshop 11 years ago. He learned the trade when he was very young, because his mother worked in this business, and it was she who taught him to make clothing. He worked as her assistant for a number of years, learning not only how to make clothing but also how to deal with customers and suppliers. After some years went by, he set up on his own when he started a family, starting by offering his services with a home sewing machine. Little by little, he became known in the area and expanded his business, taking out several loans so that he could grow. Currently, he has several industrial machines, and he has lines of clothing that he creates. His orders come from companies, consisting of polo shirts embroidered with the firm's logo, unisex trousers and vests. This type of clothing is easier to make, because it is created with standard measurements. He works from Monday through Sunday, when necessary, from 8 in the morning to 6 in the evening. He maintains fixed working hours because he has a group of people who work for him. He feels satisfied because in these years he has seen his business grow to the point of providing jobs for people who need them. Alfredo's greatest problem is getting ill, because he knows everything about his business and does not have someone to replace him. However, he says he has faith in God who will provide him with health and the strength he needs to continue. He will use the loan he is requesting to buy supplies such as fabrics, thread and buttons, and he will also use some of the funds to carry out repairs to his machines.

He has a general store that he started 17 years ago, when he first came to live in this place.  At first, his business consisted of the sale of rice and chicken, through which he was gaining customers, so he started to stock his business with a variety of products.  As he had made a big investment, he dedicated himself to the business so he could see it grow.  Now his store is well-stocked and has a big customer base.

The work is done by hanging the carpet over a metal support she had built and then she begins washing. If there are stains, Rocio applies a cleaner directly to them. Then she utilizes a cleaning machine whose tank is filled with water and carpet shampoo. The machine has rotating brushes at the base which when agitated, make the shampoo penetrate the fibers, washing out the dirt. She continues this until the water in the tank is no longer dirty.\r\n\r\nRocio says prices for cleaning vary according to carpet size but generally, she collects $10.00, and for upholstery $15.00.

As she is single, she lives with her parents.  She is already studying at the university.  She started this store with some capital that her father gave her, and she decided to invest it buying confectionery products.  Later, studying her neighborhood, she started offering cellular re-charge services.  After some time, and seeing that her business was getting good results, her parents supported her in opening up a store in front of the house.  Now her business sells stationery goods, juices, and general merchandise.  She feels that at her age, she is on a good path to keep her business stable, which is helping her pay for her university expenses.  At this time she has no plans to get married, because she wants to finish at the university, and she spends her free time working in the business.  Her store is open from 7am until 7 in the evening, and her sister helps her during the afternoon hours.  Maria Jose is requesting a loan for the first time in her life, and she is certain she can make her payments on time.

The lands are fertile, and because of this he has a large quantity of banana and cacao plants.  When he gathers the harvest, his selling locations are the town, where he offers it buyers of retail.  In the photo he is observed near a cacao plant.  The reddish color of the fruit indicates that it is mature and that he can continue the drying process for selling.  The most difficult season is the winter since the rains flood certain parts of his farm and for this reason production lowers.\r\n\r\nVictor is separated from his wife, with whom he has 2 children.  For the moment the younger lives with him and is studying the cutting of cloth\/material and tailoring.  His other son is now older and independent.

His wife is Arminda, and they have no children. They live in their own house located in a Native American community.\r\n\r\nSantos is a cheerful man and a hard-worker, with almost 30 years of experience in agriculture. He started with just one plot of land and now has four, where he grows coffee, yuca, and plantains. \"From my land, I obtain about 80 sacks of coffee in a harvest and I sell them form 120 soles (Peruvian currency) each,\" he says. One of his problems in all his years as a farmer has been the lack of capital, and because of this he says that he has been able to achieve many things little by little. In spite of the illnesses that afflict his plants, he puts on a smile and faces these kinds of problems with wisdom. He longs to plant more coffee, and because of this he has plans to cut the old coffee plants and replant some small ones, in order to guarantee a better bean production.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth credit that he receives from MFP, because of this he promises to pay his monthly payments on time. He belongs to the community bank \"Shantzoshis\", a solid and organized group.\r\n\r\nHe will invest the money from this loan in the purchase of tools for removing his plants and to buy bags of fertilizer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1122773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy tools to clean up his plants and bags of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-04T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-03T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1058,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867709,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-06T20:05:26Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":442172,"name":"Lua`a Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group of entrepreneurs calls themselves \u201cLua`a.\u201d There are three members, Aisha, Faizh and Lua`a, who know each other and are neighbors from Aden, Yemen.\r\n\r\nAmong the members is Faizh, 31 years old (in the center of the photo) and a wife and mother of four children.
