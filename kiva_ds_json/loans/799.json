Currently Churek lives with her daughter-in-law and her grandson, while her son is away to Russia to earn money. \r\n\r\nChurek was born into a simple family of a sheep herder. After school she attended Prjewalski co-op institute to earn her degree as a saleswoman. Upon finishing her studies Churek moved to the Moskovski region where she had relatives and started working as a milkmaid in the \"Druzhba\" farming co-op in the Aleksandrovka village. In 1981 she married a tractor driver from the same co-op. The young family received a house from the co-op's administration and Churek's four children were born there. They lived and worked for the co-op for 20 years, raised their children there, slowly purchased their own herd of livestock. After the farming co-op broke apart with the fall of the Soviet Union, they lost their jobs and were forced to sell their livestock and move to the Rovnoe village in Panfilovski region, where they were able to buy a house. Churek's husband started working as a mechanic in \"Shapak\" farming co-op and Churek took care of the house and children. \r\n\r\nIn 2003 Churek and her husband decided to start raising livestock again and purchased a heifer. Their livestock business began with 5,000 som (KGS) and it grew to yield 7,000 som (KGS) monthly profits. In 2010 Churek's husband passed away and she became her family's main provider. Her hard work and determination allowed Churek to continue her husband's business and currently her herd has two milk cows and a heifer. In order to purchase more animals she has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). Churek is planning to use the profits from this loan to purchase more animals and in the future save enough money for her grandson's education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1016553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Chincha was named after the Chincha people, who are known for their advanced knowledge of agriculture and for their maritime exploits.  Today, Chincha is an incredible mix of cultures, with a large Afro-Peruvian population, which comes from the remnants of an indigenous past and the influence of the Spanish empire.  The city, along with other cities close to the Pacific coast, was damaged in 2001 and 2007 when high-magnitude earthquakes struck.  However, it has endured, just as it always has throughout a large part of its history.  In her free time she likes to watch soap operas.  As everyone knows, Peru is famous for having the most delicious food in the world and one of Dionisia's favorite dishes is the wonderful carapulcra con sopa seca.  Dionisia is the mother of four children, all of whom are now adults.\n\nDionisia works selling toasted corn, peanuts, broad beans, and candy.  She does this work for five hours a day and she can serve up to 25 customers in one day.  She believes that her business is going well because she seasons her food well and because she is charismatic with her customers.\n\nDionisia is very thankful to Kiva's lenders, as it is their help that will allow her to buy more merchandise, which will allow her to have fresh ingredients with which to prepare her dishes and keep offering quality products.  This will allow her to keep working toward achieving her greatest dream: to be able to offer other products and to grow as a small businesswoman.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1011210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She likes to make the \u201ctanates\u201d (baskets for tortillas) and fans.  She is proud of how her finished baskets, fans, and figures look so pretty.  She is well-known for making handicrafts from palm by all in her community.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to expand her business and make other different figures, and she thinks she will do it with the loan she will receive.  Her dreams and hopes are for her business to grow, to continue making tortilla baskets, fans, and figures from palm.  She also dreams of her children learning to make these handicrafts.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group want to say thanks to Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  \u201cMany thanks for the loans that help us to keep working in the businesses and to have a better family life.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1009306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy palm and paint to make baskets, fans, and toy figures.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-02-28T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-29T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ogilve ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":320.31,"local_amount":4062.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330444,"comment":null},{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3279.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044466,"comment":null},{"amount":320.32,"local_amount":4062.5,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656657,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1639.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317329,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-28T11:06:09Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T16:57:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396226,"name":"Ruben","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Ruben continua con su negocio de su pulperia, trabajando al lado de su esposa, quien es quien mas atiende el negocio, ya que ahora el administra su propio taxi, generandole mejores ingresos para apoyar a su hija de 13 a\u00f1os quien cursa la secundaria, el cual se esfuerza mucho para estar en mejores condiciones de vivienda, salud.\nComo objetivo es el crecimiento de su negocio, en donde seguira comprando mas granos basicos, productos lacteos, carne, pollo, productos de limpiezas, pote de leche, frutas, verduras, cosmeticos, ofreciendo una gama de productos accesible a sus clientes.

of Neen). Its members decided to call it that because in their community, there are a lot of Neen trees, which serve to control diabetes and blood pressure.  This group is made up of three hardworking and nice people with desires to improve and complete their lives. The representative of this group is Mr. Francisco Bruno, an intelligent and hard-working man of 42 years who is happily married to Mrs. Maura Berta, a very nice and hard-working woman with the strength necessary to help her husband with what he needs. They have three children, Berta Sof\u00eda, Eva Maria and Carla Idolina. They are their pride and motivation to fight to continue helping them so the children can achieve their dreams and the parents can give the kids a good education. Better known as Don Chico, Mr. Bruno has been dedicated to the production of limes and bananas since he was five years old.

He says that he grows some of the fruit he sells himself and buys the rest in the wholesale food market in a nearby town.  He says that he has been in this business for ten years, since he was very young.  He used to help his parents sell in the markets and streets in different towns.  Janitzio is requesting a loan to buy fruit such as peaches, avocados, blackberries, cauliflowers, lettuce, spinach, carrots, etc.  He says that he will also buy manure and fertilizers because he has an avocado orchard with approximately 50 trees but only 30 are producing.  One of the difficulties that he has is transporting his fruit because it costs a lot to pay somebody to do this.  He would like to have his own vehicle and he is working hard so that he can buy a used truck.  He would also like to continue sowing more avocado plants because this is a good business, and he would love to own cows, pigs and lambs so that he can guarantee his children's future.\r\n\r\nJanitzio is married to Carolina who is a homemaker.

Ana is a hard-working, honest woman who has a great desire to do well.  Her family is the most important thing in the world to her.  She doesn't lose hope of some day seeing her children become professionals with better opportunities in life.  This is what inspires her to work hard in her store which she worked hard to set up.

Her dream is to continue to keep her business active because it is her primary source of income and has allowed her to provide for her family. \r\n\r\nThis is why she has decided to ask for a loan from INTEGRAL. She plans to invest in her business by buying more fruits and vegetables (potatoes, onions, tomatoes, carrots, watermelon, oranges, lemons, avocados, pineapples and more) and hopefully achieve her goal of improving the standard of living of her family.

She wishes to make her business grow, in order to have more economic income and to provide a better quality of life to her family.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Marta Lorena is requesting the amount of 100,000.00 colones ($200USD), in order to buy the materials for her shop, including items like fabrics, threads, and elastics, since she wants to continue giving the best tailoring service to her community and thus obtain more clients.\r\n\r\nMarta Lorena is a member of the communal banking group Rinc\u00f3n Grande S.A. This will be her fourth loan, and she is very grateful for the opportunities of access to credit that the group provides so that she can carry out her life's projects."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1012017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase

is a 36-year-old farmer who is married to Meriana, a 36-year-old lady. Ayub and Meriana are blessed with two children from their marriage, namely: Fenny, 14,  who is studying in the 2nd grade of Junior High School, and Ferdy, 11, who is studying at the 4th grade of Elementary School.\r\n\r\nAyub has been a farmer for years. From the job, Ayub is able to earn income to finance his children's schooling costs and households needs. He cultivates vegetables such as mustard greens, water spinach, tomatoes and cucumber at his farm. Ayub is lucky since his neighbor allows him to utilize part of the field to cultivate paddy. The income from the harvest will be shared equally with the landlord.\r\n \r\nAt the end of January Ayub spent his capital to plant rice and to buy the fertilizer. He plans to continue cultivating vegetables but he needs more money to buy more seedlings and fertilizer. Therefore he is requesting a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 4,000,000. Ayub is hoping that TLM will help him through the loan assistance for his business improvement.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1016531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Her three children have all completed high school, which makes her very proud. For 12 years, Maria has been earning a living by selling food such as chuchitos (small corn tamales), bread with chicken, atole, toast, enchiladas, and other traditional foods of the region.  <p>\r\n\r\nWith hard work and determination, Maria was able to purchase a small store in the market two years ago, which she now operates from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday. While her sales have increased, Maria  depleted all of her savings in order to purchase the store. Looking for a small loan to be able to purchase more materials, Maria decided to join the Seagulls Trust Bank, comprised of seven members who have 29 children among them. Their businesses range from restaurants to veterinary assistance to tortilla-making. Like Maria, they are all striving to make a better life for their families. <p>\r\n\r\nMaria, who has expanded her product line to include purified water, sodas, smoothies and meals, hopes to one day have a larger store to accommodate more customers. \"My group and I feel fortunate that people in other countries, who don't even know us, are willing to support us financially,\" said Maria. \"Our families are benefiting, which is our goal.

In this way she can increase her income, allowing her to better meet her financial obligations, and improve her quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1013906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Sialupe Huamantanga - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-28T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-29T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":139.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":149.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":148.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":161.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":185.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":192},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":196.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":139.95,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":140.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270012184,"comment":null},{"amount":53.44,"local_amount":142.5,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":143.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621300,"comment":null},{"amount":55.89,"local_amount":149.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":149.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332670,"comment":null},{"amount":55.8,"local_amount":148.8,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":149.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423460,"comment":null},{"amount":60.66,"local_amount":161.75,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":162.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316857,"comment":null},{"amount":60.96,"local_amount":162.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":163.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373695,"comment":null},{"amount":62.55,"local_amount":166.8,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":167.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308384961,"comment":null},{"amount":65.83,"local_amount":175.55,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":176.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368551,"comment":null},{"amount":67.27,"local_amount":179.4,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":180.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977624,"comment":null},{"amount":215.12,"local_amount":573.65,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":576.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331114871,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-10T20:53:33Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:57:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398198,"name":"Ma.ruby","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ma.

He fattens goats and also works as a shepherd on a collective farm.  There is a herd on the collective farm, which counts over 200 goats.  Having rich experience in livestock raising, Sayfuddin also takes his goats to pasture.  Taking into consideration harsh weather conditions, Sayfuddin leads his herd into the mountains, and in winter he brings the animals back.

village called Cruz Blanca, San Juan Sacatepequez, in the central highlands of Guatemala, where access is by dirt road. The group is very active and dynamic; it is composed of seven women, dedicated to various commercial and production activities, such as: sale of clothing, animal husbandry, and the sale of meat, which are sold in the community or the nearest market (20 minutes away from the village). All the members are neighbors and know one another.  This is their third loan cycle, and their two previous loans with Friendship Bridge were paid in full and on time. \n\nMaria Francisca, treasurer of the group, is forty-six years old, married and has four daughters. In recent years Maria Francisca has been a working with livestock, rather than weaving. She sells her products in the market nearby (20 minutes from where she lives) on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Maria Francisca believes strongly in good education, although she did not have the opportunity to attend school herself, but she encourages her daughters, currently in kindergarten, 1st, 4th and 5th grades, to stay in school.  Her dream is that they graduate from high school and ultimately from college. \n\nWith the new loan, Maria Francisca wants to increase her sales. She plans to add variety to her business, so she will buy more chickens, turkeys, ducks and pigs to meet her clients\u2019 needs. With her income Maria Francisca can provide better standard of living for her family, as the cost of living has increased and her husband's income is not enough. Maria Francisca is very optimistic about the future; she hopes to be more successful through growing her business with the support of her daughters. \n\nMaria Francisca and her Trust Bank are very grateful that people from around the world know about them and take time to invest in them. They believe that Friendship Bridge and Kiva loans make a difference in their lives. \"Wow, technology has advanced, and there are no barriers to support another human being,\" says Francisca Maria

Rosa Maria also sells traditional clothing. As she lives near the market, she made a small space in a room in her house to open a small shop where she sells her products. Rosa Maria is excited to get another loan with Friendship Bridge, which she will use to purchase fabric and thread to fill the orders she has, especially during this time of the year (which is right before Easter).  Many people place orders with her because of her modern designs. Rosa Maria's dream is to have market stall or storefront in the market.

In search of a financing source for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1996 with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Seyde's persistent work, today her business has two cows, seven heads of sheep and one horse, and yields about 12,000 som from sales of milk and meat products.  Also, Seyde works on 2.28 hectares of land, where she grows cereal crops, potatoes and sainfoin.  In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.

Gulnisa started her work career as a biology teacher and was awarded the \"Excellent Educator of the Kyrgyz Republic\" medal for her high performance.  Currently, she works at a school in the Pokrovka village.  In search of a financing source for her family, Gulnisa started her own business in animal husbandry in 2000. Thanks to her persistent work, today her business has one cow with a calf and ten sheep. Also, Gulnisa works on 2.15 hectares of irrigated land, where she grows beans. In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows and mineral fertilizers. Gulnisa plans to invest the earnings into increasing livestock headcount

But because it gave her shame to go out and sell, her daughter was the one who started selling. After some time she got comfortable with the idea and with the help of a loan she increased her sales and started to sell beauty products, jewelry, corn on the cob and 'frituras' (a fried snack food) as well. Maria wants to restock her merchandise and to buy a small cart to be able to sell corn on the cob from, so that she isn't limited to only selling outside of her home, but can also go to different neighborhoods. In the future, with her profits, she wants to improve her house and buy a car.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1014068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to restock merchandise and buy a small cart to sell corn on the cob from.

necesario para el d\u00eda a d\u00eda y ya no para invertir, es por eso que su hijo decidi\u00f3 ayudarlos y sacar un pr\u00e9stamo para que ella abriese la tienda, con la \u00fanica condici\u00f3n de

She is married and has 4 children, two of which are adults and the other two, whom she is still caring for are 8 years old and 10 years old. They are both in school and in a few weeks will resume with classes again. \r\n\r\nBenedicta and her husband work hard to help their children get ahead. Her husband earns income preparing and distributing meals and she sells groceries and ice creams from her small store. Her store was recently reopened, thanks to one of her older children. A few months ago her husband had an accident and was not able to work to provide income. They got to the point where they only had money for day to day necessities and nothing to reinvest in the store. It is because of this that their son decided to help them by taking out a loan so that Benedicta could stock her store and re-open her business, with the only condition that she must work hard. With this good news Benedicta was filled with joy and she re-opened her store. Thanks to God her husband has now recovered and has returned to work.    \r\n\r\nBenedicta has the dream of opening a Mini Market. She is currently working an average of 15 hours a day. She has her business in the front part of her living room so that she can take care of her small children at the same time. With much effort and dedication she will be able to improve her income, but right now she doesn't have the necessary money to buy the school supplies and other items that she will need when classes start in a few weeks, and which her customers have already started asking for. It is for this reason that she has requested a loan through Kiva.   \r\n\r\nShe has decided, in a few weeks, to start using a part of her living room as storage for the store. She wants to repay her son for the support he provided her when she needed it most. She is thankful that she is increasing her income, with which she will provide a better education to her two small daughters.

","en":"Ainagul is a 49-year-old widow who is raising a son, still in school.  Like many families in search of income for their family, Ainagul fattens livestock.  She started this activity in 2009 with an initial amount of 20,000 som (KGS).  Today, she owns one cow and a couple of sheep, and the sale of dairy and meat products allows her to earn close to 8,000 som per month for her family.  In order to further expand her business, Ainagul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy a dairy cow.  With her revenues, she plans to do some repairs in her

Nurbu also farms two hectares of land where she grows beans and perennial grasses. In order to further develop her business, Nurbu turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase two heifers.

Natalya was born and grew up in Ak-Suu on the family farm. After graduating from high school, she married a fellow villager. Natalya's husband worked as a mechanic on one of the largest cooperative farms, and she worked in a sugar factory. Five years later, Natalya and her husband collected the money to buy a small house in Ak-Suu. For additional income, the family decided to farm. The husband built a place for the livestock. They bought a few piglets. Today, Natalya and her son take care of the household. Her husband works on a tractor, but since his work is seasonal, in the winter, he slaughters livestock and sells the meat at the local market.
