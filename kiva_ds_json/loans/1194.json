Mauricio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santiago es un joven esposo y padre de 30 a\u00f1os, tuvo la oportunidad de prepararse en educaci\u00f3n superior, sin embargo no le fue f\u00e1cil conseguir un empleo, est\u00e1 casado con Eliana de 26 a\u00f1os con quien tiene 1 hijo de apenas un a\u00f1o de edad, ellos se casaron siendo muy j\u00f3venes y han tenido que trabajar muy duro para solventar sus necesidades como familia. Santiago vive con su esposa e hijo en el Cant\u00f3n de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. Tambi\u00e9n es una ciudad ideal para actividades de comercio por el paso de turistas en la ciudad y las necesidades de sus habitantes. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nSantiago al vivir la dura experiencia de la falta de oportunidades laborales en su ciudad y a\u00fan en las ciudades aleda\u00f1as, decidi\u00f3 emprender su propio negocio hace un par de a\u00f1os, aplicando los conocimientos de administraci\u00f3n que obtuvo en su formaci\u00f3n acad\u00e9mica. Invierte por lo menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en su Centro de C\u00f3mputo en donde acuden estudiantes de escuelas, colegios, universitarios, ejecutivos e inclusive familias a hacer uso del servicio de internet, c\u00e1mara web y de los programas computacionales. A veces el tiempo invertido se prolonga por el mantenimiento minucioso que debe hacer a los equipos. A medida que Santiago ha incrementado los servicios y ha trabajado en mejorar cada d\u00eda la atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes, la demanda ha crecido y muchas veces personas esperan para poder tener acceso a un computador, por esta raz\u00f3n, este hombre emprendedor solicita un cr\u00e9dito con el cual comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s computadoras que las ubicar\u00e1 en el espacio disponible que le queda en el local, de esta forma podr\u00e1 atender a todas las personas que llegan en busca de los servicios que se presta en su local y as\u00ed incrementar sus ingresos que le ayuden a brindar a su familia un estilo de vida de calidad y un d\u00eda poder cumplir su sue\u00f1o de tener su casa propia. ","en":"Santiago, age 30, is a young husband and father.  He had the chance to get a higher education.  Nevertheless, it was not easy to find employment.  He is married to Eliana, age 26, and they have one child who is just one year old.  They got married when they were very young, and they have had to work very hard to pay for the family\u2019s necessities.\r\n\r\nSantiago lives with his wife and child in the Salcedo canton, which is in the eastern part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces in the Ecuadorian mountains.  There are various tourist attractions like lakes and spas in Salcedo.  They offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists.  However, the main business activity in this town is farming and, to a lesser extent, livestock.  It is also an ideal city for commerce because of the tourists that pass through the city and the inhabitants\u2019 necessities.  In spite of these productive activities, there are very worrisome indicators of illiteracy and poverty because basic needs are not met.  An example is the sewer service that only 25% have in their homes.\r\n\r\nUpon living the difficult experience of the lack of work opportunities in his city, and even in surrounding cities, Santiago decided to undertake his own business two years ago.  He applies the knowledge of administration that he got when going to school.  He spends at least eight hours each day at his Computer Center.  This is where students from elementary school, high school, universities, and executives, including families, go to make use of internet service, web camera, and computer programs.   Sometimes he spends more time there because of the meticulous maintenance he needs to perform on the equipment.\r\n\r\nAs Santiago has increased the service and worked every day to improve customer service, the demand has grown.  People often wait to be able to have access to a computer.  For this reason, this enterprising man is requesting a loan to buy more computers.  He will place them in the available space that he has at his place.  This way he will be able to tend to all of the people who arrive seeking the services he offers at his place.  This way he will increase his income that will help him provide his family with a quality lifestyle.  One day he will be able to fulfill his dream of having his own house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":851.13,"image":{"id":1414692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to buy computers for his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salcedo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-08-21T21:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-20T21:00:33Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1386.9,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":155.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":164.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":168.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":171.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":175.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":179.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":183.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":187.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":330.83,"local_amount":327.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":330.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320658,"comment":null},{"amount":168.61,"local_amount":167.03,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":168.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856346,"comment":null},{"amount":173.52,"local_amount":171.9,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":173.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059924,"comment":null},{"amount":178.17,"local_amount":176.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":178.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995256,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T14:12:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598076,"name":"Norma Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norma es una mujer de 39 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta 9\u00ba grado, esta acompa\u00f1ada; su pareja trabaja como motorista del transporte publico.

Obtaining a higher profit margin and improving her family's earnings is her principal objective. \r\n\r\nJeimy and her husband are in the process of expanding their new business. They have invested much of their money and assets into it. With an established stock of merchandise, they sell their clothes at the weekly festivals in Grecia as well as in different stores in the region.

Jeimy's goal is to produce clothing and sell it directly so that she earns more profits from her merchandise and achieve growth that leads to consolidation. Jeimy and her husband each have much experience in dressmaking. They started their family business with their own capital and they already have equipment and machinery that allows them to produce quality products for their clients.

Lailo's family owns 0.15 hectare of land and also uses 0.3 hectare of \"presidential\" land for the cultivation of crops.  Lailo and her sisters help their mother with the farm work: from planting to harvesting.  \n\nLailo is a very hardworking and energetic young woman who would like to start her own business.  She is thinking of buying and selling livestock, as she has all the conditions required to run such a business: there is a small barn in the house's courtyard to keep some livestock, and she could use a portion of the family's farming production to feed her livestock.  \n\nLailo's starting capital amounts to 500 USD.  She is requesting a loan as additional capital, to buy four young bulls and start her own business.\n\nLailo says that her mother will help her run this business.

She lives with her husband, with whom she has a son, 27.  Her business is selling merchandise such as clothing and footwear, and food such as cheese sticks.\r\n\r\nDiana started her business three years ago selling party snacks (cheese sticks, mini-empanadas) on the recommendation of her son, who inspired her to set up this business.  In the beginning it was a way to make the most of her her time.  Once she went about her sales activities, however, she started realizing that the business was giving her income that helped with the household expenses.  Diana pays in cash and sells on credit to neighbors and friends.  She works from Monday through Sunday from 8 in the morning until 8 in the evening.\r\n\r\nThis is her first Kiva loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

His vision is to start a solar product business and even own a shop to sell products to people in rural areas. Only about 4% of the population in rural Tanzania has access to electricity and the national grid. Therefore, providing solar products has a great impact on people\u2019s lives and may contribute to empower the population in rural areas. For instance, businesses may extend their shop hours, people can offer mobile phone charging stations, or children can study for school after nightfall.\n\nDue to his former occupation as an electrical technician, he has a lot of connections in the energy sector as well as technical knowledge. This will help a great deal when setting up a business.\n\nHe is convinced that he can sell 10 products per day! Thus, he is eager to get access to a loan.

Azizhon came to our organization to make his dream come true.  He has a land plot and wants to install a greenhouse there to grow ecologically clean products, such as fresh cucumbers, tomatoes and greens.  His grandfather, who has many years of experience, advises him in this endeavor.  Azizhon's parents also support him.  In the future, Azizhon wants to expand his selection and grow vegetables with the help of biological minerals, fertilizers and heat the greenhouse with the help of biogas.  Azizhon came to Arvand to obtain a loan.  He plans to purchase mineral fertilizers for his greenhouse.  Azizhon thanks Arvand in advance for the support and realization of his plans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":369.11,"image":{"id":1401477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase mineral fertilizers for his greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Azizhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":72},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":72.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":74.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":77.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80.52},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":81.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":85.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":86.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":90.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":92.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":93.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":94.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":95.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":144.9,"local_amount":144.9,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":144.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136794,"comment":null},{"amount":73.81,"local_amount":73.81,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":73.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900992,"comment":null},{"amount":74.73,"local_amount":74.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":74.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550174,"comment":null},{"amount":75.67,"local_amount":75.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":75.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774396,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T08:35:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":595916,"name":"Leah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leah is married and has been blessed with two children, both of whom attend school.

Est\u00e1 casado con Blanca de 40 a\u00f1os, se casaron siendo muy j\u00f3venes y han trabajado de forma independiente y sacrificada para sacar adelante su hogar. Tienen un hijo de 15 a\u00f1os Byron que se encuentra estudiando en un colegio p\u00fablico y a quien Segundo espera verlo convertido en un profesional de excelencia. Viven en Ecuador en el pueblito de Salcedo lugar donde la principal actividad que desarrollan es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares, a pesar de este obst\u00e1culo sus habitantes luchan por salir adelante.\nSegundo se dedica a la crianza de pollos, actividad que hered\u00f3 de sus padres y abuelos, y en la cual invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda, y un poco m\u00e1s en los d\u00edas de feria cuando sale a comercializar sus animales. Este negocio ha funcionado durante 30 a\u00f1os y la falta de capital ha sido un impedimento para el crecimiento, sin embargo las ganancias que ha obtenido del mismo han servido para abastecer la demanda de sus clientes y el mercado. Ahora Segundo solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayudar\u00e1 a comprar animales de crianza y tambi\u00e9n alimento al por mayor, de esta forma obtendr\u00e1 un ahorro y por ende mayores ingresos que le ayudar\u00e1n a cubrir los gastos de educaci\u00f3n de su hijo y adem\u00e1s ofrecer a su familia un mejor estilo de vida.

","en":"Segundo is a 57 year-old man who grew up in the country and has only a limited elementary education.  He is married to Blanca, who is 40 years old.  They married when they were very young, and they've worked independently and sacrificed to provide for their family.  They have a 15 year-old son, Byron, who attends a public school, whom Segundo hopes to see become an excellent professional.  They live in Ecuador, in the little town of Salcedo.  This is a place where the main economic activity is agriculture, followed by livestock production.  The nice weather that this canton enjoys also makes it a very suitable place for raising livestock.  In spite of all of these productive activities there are worrisome rates of illiteracy and poverty, and there are unmet basic needs, such as sewer service, which only 25 percent of households have.  In spite of all of these obstacles, the residents here strive to get ahead.\r\n\r\nSegundo has a business raising chickens, which he inherited from his parents and grandparents.  He spends 8 hours a day working in this activity, and a little more on the market days when he goes out to sell his animals.  This business has operated for 30 years, and a lack of capital has been an impediment to its growth.  However, the earnings that he has obtained from the business have enabled him to meet the demand of his customers and of the market.  At this time, Segundo is requesting a loan that will help him to buy animals to raise, and also to buy animal feed at wholesale.  In this way he will obtain savings and thereby increase his income, which will help him to cover the educational expenses for his son and also offer his family a better quality of life.  Segundo thanks the Fundacion Alternativa for the trust they have placed in him so that he can contribute to the growth of his nation's economy.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":387.06,"image":{"id":1414807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens and chicken feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salcedo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundo Leonardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1668.53,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":84.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":97.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":105.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":106.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":109.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":112.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":113.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":116.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":118.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":123.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":126.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":129.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.94},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.21},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.72,"local_amount":84.39,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":84.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814488,"comment":null},{"amount":98.18,"local_amount":97.8,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":98.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320660,"comment":null},{"amount":101.62,"local_amount":101.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":101.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856348,"comment":null},{"amount":102.54,"local_amount":102.14,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":102.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059926,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T05:58:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598166,"name":"Jovel Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Jovel de 47 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en casa propia con su compa\u00f1era de vida y sus 4 hijos 12, 15, 17, y 18 a\u00f1os ellos estudian actualmente, desde hace 20 a\u00f1os se dedica a la agricultura especialmente al cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol, comercializa sus productos en los alrededores de su comunidad tiene mucha clientela por los buenos precios y la calidad de sus productos con las ganancias que obtiene logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, Don Jovel solicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas como: fertilizantes, abonos, semillas, herbicidas, controles de plagas, etc. para su cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol y con esto espera brindarle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Jovel, 47, lives in his own home with his spouse and their four children, ages 12, 15, 17 and 18, all of whom are currently in school.

The financial responsibility falls directly on her, so she wants to start her own business, a restaurant where she'll serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\r\n\r\nShe already has a place but to implement her business plan she needs the support of the loan to buy fixed assets (tables, chairs, a stove, a refrigerator, pots, cutlery, dinner service) and ingredients (meat, vegetables, grains, fruit, soda).

Her planned schedule is 6:30 a.m. until 7:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nMariana has the advantage of knowing this field because currently she sells fried foods and has taken several cooking classes.

He has been working as a farmer all his life, in the employ of various farms in his areas. Four years ago, building on the experience acquired during those jobs, he decided to start his own business, namely the raising and fattening of pigs to sell. His goal is to earn an independent income, and he has succeeded to pay for basic household expenses since he started. Arley is full of enterprising spirit: he works long hours every day and is always looking for the best way to overcome obstacles, since setbacks can be caused by external factors wholly out of his control, one example being the fluctuations in meat prices. This is why Arley asks for his third loan with the field partner. He will use the funds to buy piglets to fatten, as well as supplies such as vitamins and feed. This will enable him to increase his production and to have a better profit margin, that he will put towards improving his business and giving his family a better life.

After the death of her husband, Sarabubu did not have a long time to get over the loss of a loved one.  She had to raise her children to stand on their own two feet, so she decided to take the household and financial responsibilities into her own hands.  Sarabubu has a high school education.  Her neighbors see her as an enterprising and capable woman.  Her elder daughter works as a journalist and her son is a student.  Her daughter helps her mother make ends meet every month.  \r\n\r\nSarabubu raises livestock and grows crops, which have been the family's main source of income since 1994.  She started this business with 10,000 som (KGS), and thanks to her hard work, her farm now has two dairy cows, one bull, four sheep and she also has a .72 hectare plot of land on which she grows barley.  Her business bring her about 9,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and calves, which covers the basic costs of food and household needs for her family.  \r\n\r\nThe income from the farm has allowed Sarabubu to raise and provide for her children.  With the goal of developing her business further, Sarabubu has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy calves to raise and resell.  She plans to invest the income from this loan back into her farm, and also to pay for her son's future education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":495,"image":{"id":1410506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

\"hero-mother\" who is raising six children (two daughters and four sons).  Orizjon has a high school education, her husband is disabled and the children help her around the house.  Their family is big and friendly, and their family ties are very strong.  The two elder sons are migrant workers in Russia, and they help their parents by sending money home on a monthly basis.  The rest of the children are still in school and pre-school.\r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for the family, Orzijon has been involved in agriculture and raising livestock since 1990.  She started this business with 2,000 som (KGS) and thanks to her hard work, her farm now has one dairy cow and 13 sheep, as well as a .72 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes, sunflowers and corn.  Her farm brings in about 12,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and livestock, and it is enough to provide food and household items for the family.  The income from her farm has allowed Orzijon to improve her standard of living.  With the goal of developing her business further, Orzijon has turned to the microcredit bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy calves.  She plans to reinvest the income from the loan back into her farm, and she intends to make repairs on her home in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1410524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Shakhzada is 41 years old and is married with four children.  She has a high school education and her neighbors see her as an enterprising and hard-working woman.  Her husband and children actively help her around the house.  As the main source of income from her family, Shakhzada has been involved in agriculture and raising livestock since 1999.  She started this business with 6,000 som (KGS).  She has a lot of experience in breeding and raising livestock and also in working the land.  Thanks to her hard work, Shakhzada now has one dairy cow, two calves and seven sheep on her farm, as well as a two-hectare plot of land on which she grows corn, sunflowers and potatoes.  Her farm brings in about 15,000 som (KGS) per month, which is enough to pay for the food and household goods for her family.  Shakhzada is trying to increase her farm's income to help her family.  With the goal of developing her business further, she turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep to raise and resell.  Shakhzada plans to reinvest the income from this loan back into her farm, and she also has plans to make repairs on her home, where she lives with her

She is single and has three children, with two of them currently in school. For the past five years, Harriet has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, soap and salt. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Harriet has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda.

He has worked in agriculture from a young age, always working alongside his father and siblings.

With a great deal of effort he worked with their oxen to provide the daily food for his family.\r\n\r\nWhen Ismael was 23 he got married but he still helped his mother out. During his marriage he had 6 children who all have families of their own now. Four of them work with him in agriculture, growing 28,000 square metres of corn together. Ismael lives with just his wife, as his family all have their own homes.\r\n\r\nThe land where he works is 1km from his home and he has to get up early every day to get through all the necessary cultivation tasks.

When she got married, her husband helped her to take care of 7,000 m2 planted with corn. She always hires laborers.

Manjula sells her products to the local traders on a weekly basis.

She sells general grocery items like sugar, lentils, biscuits, soap, shampoo, chocolate and stationery such as books, pens, etc. Binakumari was able to increase the variety of items at her general store with her scanty savings and increase her cash flow. Her monthly income from the existing business is Rs.4000\/-. Out of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses. As per her statement, she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. \r\n\r\nBinakumari wants to increase the stock of her business. So the loan amount will be utilized to purchase items like sugar, tea dust, lentils, biscuits, soap, shampoo, chocolate etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock less frequently from the nearest town, 15 kms away. Binakumari hopes to save enough to build a good house for her family as the present house is very small and congested. She also dreams of giving a better education to her children. The other three members of the group are  Dahana, Basanti and Jashobanti who are running a bamboo basket-making and selling business, a general store and a milk business respectively. \r\n\r\nSince the inception of Trishakti group, Binakumari has been heading the group with dedication and sincerity.

This is why he's applied for a loan. Rubiel will use the loan funds to purchase a delivery van and inventory (dairy products, meat, grains, cleaning supplies, and other basic goods). The store will then have a greater variety of products to sell and the van will allow easier transport of goods. Rubiel can then launch a home delivery service, boosting the store's customer base as well as sales and income.

Several times she has requested loans from local financial institutions for her hair care business start-up but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of her low income and lack of experience in this new business. The only source of income for her family is the small monthly salary earned by Zhana\u2019s father working as a mini-bus driver. Her brother studies at high school and needs a lot of money for student expenses. \r\n\r\nZhana has high education but she is unable to find a job with her profession and generate an income, so she requested a loan from Credo to start a beauty salon. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with reasonable conditions for the country's vulnerable poor who do not have access to standard credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nZhana will purchase equipment for her beauty salon and start up a hair care business.

In addition, he runs a small-scale agricultural business and grows various vegetables. \n\nHe works hard all day long but his earnings are not enough to cover the cost of food and everyday expenses. For this reason, Paata decided to start a dairy farm. Paata's loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with reasonable terms to start-up businesses. These loans are provided to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low incomes. \n\nThe loan will be used to purchase a milk cow. Paata will place the cow in the cattle shed located in his yard and he will sell the dairy products at the local market. Thanks to this loan, he will improve his quality of life and increase his income. His goal is to provide his family with better living conditions and his children with an education.

years old, a widow, and has raised three children (two daughters and one son). Sayragul has secondary technical education. The neighbors speak of her as a friendly and responsible woman. After the death of her husband, Sayragul pulled herself together, bravely endured the loss of her husband and took the whole burden of caring for and supporting her children, and the welfare of the family as a whole. The two daughters live and work in Russia, and they help family financially, sending their salary every month. The son lives together with his mother. \r\n\r\nAs main income for the family, Sayragul has worked with livestock breeding since 1996, after having started this business with 1,200 som (KGS). She has long experience in breeding and keeping livestock. Thanks to persistent work, Sayragul has two dairy cows, one horse, one foal and one heifer on her farm. Her business brings in around 6,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as the basis for covering food and household expenses for the family. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Sayragul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of bull-calves. Sayragul plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, and in the future she also intends to repair her house where she lives with her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":206.25,"image":{"id":1410746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy bull-calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Tyuz village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sayragul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":10081.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426997,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-26T15:51:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592203,"name":"Saul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saul dreams of becoming a professional but without a degree he knows it may never be possible.

36, is married and lives with wife and two children (2 and 5 years old) in the village of Sanakhshire. Besik is the only one who makes money in his household by doing construction work and completing custom projects locally. Besik is a very enthusiastic man and wants to generate more income and help the family. Their existing income is not enough to cover everyday expenses. So, Besik decided to start up a grocery store, but found that he didn't have enough money to do so. Unfortunately, Besik was unable to obtain a loan from existing financial institutions, as they require a stable income and business experience as a precondition for a loan. But Besik has now received his loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides start-up and re-start up loans with simple terms to the country's vulnerable poor who do not have access to credit. With a loan of 2,500 USD, Besik will rent commercial space in his district and purchase basic groceries for starting up a store. He will care for his clients and treat them in a kind and friendly way. With this determination and his loan he expects to improve his income and give his family members better living

Her family\u2019s income is 10,000,000 VND per month. \n\nHang is aware that studying will give her opportunities to find a good job and earn more money. She chooses this job because she thinks that this major is lacking in workers in Vietnam. After graduating, she can find a stable job, earn much money to afford for her family, and improve her family\u2019s living standard. She wants to borrow 10,206,000 VND to pay for her education fees and buy a computer to support her studies. If she couldn\u2019t access this loan, her studying would have to be interrupted.

The group is comprised of both males and females who have teamed up to help each other develop. Grace, just like most of the group members, does fishing as her major source of income and she gives this business a maximum of six hours per day. She started fishing in the year 1991 with high hopes of making profits and hence catering to her needs and the needs of the children. \r\n\r\nGrace has additional income from a bar which is in the same area and which she operates when she is off the fishing business, especially in the evening. She hopes to use the money to buy more fish nets and drinks for her bar so that she is able to catch more fish and serve her customers better and hence make more sales which would result in high profits. Grace\u2019s clients are the residents of Kasenyi cell and Kigabo. Her major challenges are the debts which come as a result of people drinking at her bar and not paying and the thieves who are quite many in the area. Her honesty and hard work have helped her to attain the business success which she is proud of.
