Con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n, Albeiro busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de un caballo para transportar sus productos y no tenerlos que cargar en su hombro hasta el sitio donde los entrega a sus clientes.\n\nAlbeiro espera que de esta manera pueda transportar de mejor manera sus productos, y as\u00ed pueda conservar su salud. Adem\u00e1s, como demorar\u00e1 menos tiempo en llevar sus productos hasta el sitio de entrega, podr\u00e1 entregar mayor cantidad de pedidos, pues actualmente debe negarse a entregar pedidos a sus clientes porque no le alcanza su tiempo para hacer todos los recorridos. Albeirot sue\u00f1a con poder tener un gran negocio y que este le permita sacar a su familia adelante, adem\u00e1s, sue\u00f1a con que sus hijos puedan acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad y puedan en un futuro ser unos profesionales. \n","en":"Albeiro, in spite of all the adversities that life has presented him, has had the fortitude to advance and continue making progress, together with his family. From a very young age, he learned the work of the fields, since his parents always worked at this activity and they rapidly taught it to Albeiro. When his father died, he inherited the land where he now raises a great variety of fruits, and thanks to this he generates the income necessary to sustain his household. Albeiro is married and is the father of three children, to whom he has always wanted to offer a good education. In his business, he has a large number of customers, who guarantee him a very good level of sales. Nevertheless, Albeiro has the difficulty that he needs to deliver his products to his customers at a location that is very far from where he grows his products, and for this reason he has to carry them on his shoulders for a long time. Because of this, Albeiro has already experienced some health problems. With the spirit to improve this situation, Albeiro is seeking a loan, which will offer him the possibility of being able to purchase a horse to transport his products so that he won't have to carry them on his shoulders to the place where he delivers them to his customers.\r\n\r\nAlbeiro hopes that in this way he can transport his products in a better way, and thus he can preserve his health. In addition, as it will take less time to take his products to the delivery site, he will be able to fill a larger quantity of orders, since now he has to turn down some orders from his customers because he doesn't have enough time to make all the trips. Albeiro dreams of being able to have a large business and that this will allow him to move his family forward. Furthermore, he dreams that his children can have access to a quality education and in the future can have careers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1019307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a

Maria had a dream of being able to help people from other towns who wanted to study in her city, and got the opportunity by finding a place where she could house people at much lower rates than community hotels. In this way Maria opened up her home by renting out some rooms to out-of-towners with few resources who came to her city for a better education. Thanks to this activity, Maria has generated income to contribute to the household finances and offer her three children and her husband a better quality of life while at the same time improving the quality of life and providing better opportunities to others as well. In addition to this activity, Maria also sells personal-use products via catalog, which earns her extra income for her family. With the goal of doing her work more productively, Maria is requesting a loan so she can purchase household appliances that will make her job easier. Maria hopes that in this way she can increase her productivity and tend to a greater number of people, so she can grow her profits and also make an impact in more people's lives. Maria dreams in the not-too-distant future she can start up her own restaurant and provide employment to people in need while also improving her family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1019472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase appliances to increase her productivity.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Santa Fe de Antioquia","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":56995},{"due_date":"2012-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58594},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":60238},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":61928},{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63666},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":65452},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":67288},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":69176},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":71117},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":73112},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75163},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":77271}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.68,"local_amount":115678,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":121158.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902543,"comment":null},{"amount":36.16,"local_amount":60893,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":63777.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326895,"comment":null},{"amount":35.94,"local_amount":60530,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63397.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378316,"comment":null},{"amount":77.05,"local_amount":129772,"processed_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":135919.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432945,"comment":null},{"amount":6.33,"local_amount":10657,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":11161.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617417,"comment":null},{"amount":86.23,"local_amount":145233,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":152113.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640344,"comment":null},{"amount":30.69,"local_amount":51691,"processed_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":54139.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029420,"comment":null},{"amount":63.11,"local_amount":106287,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":111322.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165568,"comment":null},{"amount":24.93,"local_amount":41988,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":43977.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548088,"comment":null},{"amount":45.88,"local_amount":77271,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":80931.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098067,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-08T12:03:56Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:47:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403545,"name":"Chheng Leang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chheng Leang (in the photo), age 29, is a tailor.

I hope to attain financial stability by my late twenties. My philosophy is that I may be a slow walker but I never walk backward. I am a principled person guided by my own goals and objectives in life. I am adventurous and an achiever with a \"go-getter\u201d attitude. I love challenges in my day-to-day life. I am of the opinion that, if I want a better tomorrow, then I must start working on it today and now."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1057822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop to help in data keeping, research and accessing coursework.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.816667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":218,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42800.04,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":161.54,"local_amount":13169.24,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13423.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301513674,"comment":null},{"amount":40.38,"local_amount":3292.31,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3355.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308499095,"comment":null},{"amount":40.38,"local_amount":3292.31,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-18T10:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3355.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315708518,"comment":null},{"amount":132.74,"local_amount":10821.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-09T09:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":11030.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339632053,"comment":null},{"amount":93.76,"local_amount":7643.3,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":7791.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364991238,"comment":null},{"amount":50.8,"local_amount":4141.21,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-19T09:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4221.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373389530,"comment":null},{"amount":5.4,"local_amount":440,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":448.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390686106,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-02T17:43:45Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:48:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408053,"name":"Mwanasiti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanasiti is a married woman.

Strathmore University instills ethical values which promote both personal and social development; thus, it was the university of my choice. I am currently in second year doing a Bachelor of Commerce which involves a lot of research, study and understanding of business-related issues. Finance is my major and it is something I pursue with a passion. \r\n\r\nI am taking out a loan for a laptop which I will use for research, making presentations, saving and backing up my work, and acquiring knowledge through access to many IT-related platforms. The world is currently in the digital age, and information is very vital to all who are going to take part in this revolution.

She is married and works as a merchant. She sells cosmetics and also bakes. She decided to go into business because of her mother's influence; she used to help her mother out on the weekends when she was not in school. Radiatou really enjoys her work because she has a lot of merchandise and her customers are able to select from a wide variety. She is a member of one of one of the branches of UIMCEC and is requesting a loan of 300,000 francs. This loan will be used to buy cosmetics to increase her stock. Radiatou's husband covers all of the household expenses; so the increase in her income that this loan will bring about will allow her to have more working capital for her business and cover her personal expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1060251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy cosmetics for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Radiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25641.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276767616,"comment":null},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25641.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283412152,"comment":null},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T08:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":25641.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287817665,"comment":null},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-19T08:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25641.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":295120919,"comment":null},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25641.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301517930,"comment":null},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25641.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308861059,"comment":null},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25641.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315888913,"comment":null},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T10:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":25641.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323609792,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-28T09:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":102567.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331715615,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T10:34:03Z","paid_date":"2013-01-28T09:52:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":401807,"name":"C 20006 Abadahemukirana Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Consolee is 40 years old and is married with six children between 7 and 20 years old.

He started his business long ago on a movable wheelbarrow usually containing a tomato basket and one other basket of potatoes. He kept on this way for a long time and then developed a business to be opened in a small shop on the street where he now sells his vegetables instead of moving on a wheelbarrow. He took a youth loan of 80,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase enough vegetables to meet the demands of his clientele, which has expanded. This loan will allow him to purchase all types of vegetables such as tomatoes, potatoes, onions, etc and to build a good relationship with his clientele by serving their needs. In the future, Mohammed hopes to expand his business and improve his capital, as this will help in generating more income. He is also saving to buy a small truck, which he will use to bring his vegetables from the vegetable

She sends money to the city of Lima and from there, they send products which she attempts to sell in her city among friends and neighbors. Cherli has been working for some 9 years on her own, and she has built up a very good customer list. Some 6 months ago she began selling groceries and the new investment is going well.\r\n\r\nCherli likes the work very much since it leaves her time for other activities. What she doesn't like is that at times, people delay paying. But she always has customers and the good thing is that since she now has years devoted to the business, she knows who to give credit to and who not to. Cherli would like, later on, to establish a silver and gold jewelry store in the city.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 5th loan through MFP. Cherli is very content to know that she will have financial aid, since she will feel more secure advancing her business. Once again, she is committed to complying with her schedule of payments, as she has with previous loans. In addition, Cherli is very content to belong to her communal bank, since everyone is very responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the 1,800 new sols requested, Cherli will purchase more silver jewelry, because she wants to keep her customers in style, and she will buy some groceries to continue in that business.

She is married with three children. Her husband is a civil servant and two of her children study at university. The other one goes to high school. She began her business life when her children's educational expenses increased. She wasn't happy with only her husband working, because she wanted to contribute to her family\u2019s budget, so she stepped into the business world. Firstly, she started to work in a textile factory. At the beginning of her job in the textile factory, she did delivery and shift work. She found the job hard, but she didn't give up because if she quit her job, she wouldn't be able to support her children's education, and she was encouraged by this thought. \n\nAfter that, she got the best job opportunity of her life. She partnered with the owner of a tailor shop with the help of someone close to her. She dedicated herself to this job. Later, her partner opened a new shop, so Fatma became the owner of the original shop. \n\nHer biggest dream is to be an expert at her job and she wants to make her own shop a fashion house. She doesn't want her husband's contribution, because she wants to do everything by herself. She financed the rest of the shop with the Maya loan, as well as repairing the machines in the shop. She appreciates the Maya loan through Kiva and has shown that she has developed her business and is determined to continue to do so in the future.\n\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Volunteers\n\nFatma Hanim 1970 Sivrihisar do\u011fumlu.

She is a good, kind and enterprising woman. She lives with her spouse and has two children, aged 25 and 12. She lives in her own house and works hard to offer a better quality of life to her family. Pilar's work is raising poultry. She has two sheds very close to the city and she goes there every day with her spouse to check on and feed her animals. Her average production is 1,500 chickens every 45 days, which is the average time needed to raise the chicks to be ready for market. She has dome this job for approximately 5 years and it is something she learned little by little. She likes her work because it gives her time to do more things. She only uses half the day to be in her sheds and the rest of the day she is at home with her children helping them with anything they need. Every day she is more convinced that the work she does is good, since she has a lot of regular customers who wait for her monthly production because her chickens are big, plump and healthy. Now she is preparing to have one more shed and she is convinced that with her hard work she will keep growing. This will be her 13th loan with MFP. She hopes for your cooperation to continue with her goals. She is also committed to making her payments on time as with the previous loans. She also wants to keep working with the members of the communal bank because they are all kind and supportive. With the 4000 soles she has asked for, she will buy chicks to raise. She will also replace some things in the sheds where she raises her birds.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1019536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chicks and materials to raise chickens.

Since 2003, Taalaibu has been engaged in animal husbandry, having started her business with an initial investment of 60,000 som (KGS). Today, Taalaibu's farm has 1 dairy cow with a calf, 1 heifer, 6 sheep, 4 goats, and a horse, and currently earns roughly 10,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and dairy products. In order to continue developing her business, Taalaibu has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase young livestock.

He lives with all of them in his own house located in the native community of Yavirironi, district of R\u00edo Negro \u2013 Satipo.  Eulogio is a persevering man and a fighter.  He works the land with the sweat of his brow and the strength of his hands, producing coffee, bananas, and avocados.\r\n\r\nFarming is what he most likes to do.  At the age of 15 he already was working, helping his family.  Now that he has a wife and children, he does this same work but with more determination because the expenses are greater.\r\n\r\nHe has two plots of land of only coffee fields.  He harvests 50 sacks a year, but he thinks that his production will increase this year.  Sales are good, but Eulogio would like to produce more.\r\n\r\n\"I don't use fertilizer.  My coffee is organic, so my sales are immediate,\" he says proudly.  When he has the sacks ready for sale, he takes them to the city of Satipo, where he offers a 50-kilo bag for 500 soles (PEN).\r\n\r\nOne of his plans is to acquire another plot of land to grow more plants.  In this way he will give his family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis would be his first loan with MFP, for which he thanks them in advance for their help.  He mentions that he will make his monthly payments punctually.  Inkani is the name of his recent communal bank.  He is excited about working with people whose interests are similar.\r\n\r\nHe will invest the 1000 PEN in pay for day laborers who will help to weed the coffee field.  He also will buy coffee plants to update a part of his planting.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1019690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire day laborers and to buy coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eulogio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455770,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-03T01:34:27Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":405151,"name":"Isaura Carola","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Isaura Carola,  ella es habitante de Catarina municipio de Masaya,  menciona que ella siempre se ha relacionado con el producto de elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de artesan\u00eda porque  sus padres le ense\u00f1aron a como desenvolverse en este negocio, ya que ellos tambi\u00e9n Vivian de ese tipo de negocio, aparte que la zona se desarrolla mucho en lo que respecta en artesan\u00eda de todo tipo.

She is part of a group called \"Hortensias\", because Do\u00f1a Martina loves these flowers and decided to give that name to the group.\r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working and enterprising woman, who goes out daily to the villages living near her area to sell seasonal fruits and vegetables such as avocado, lettuce, green chili peppers, tomatoes, cactus, plantains, mandarins, oranges, beans, and apples, peaches, melons, guavas, and more.  She comments that she began this vegetable business more than 19 years ago to help her husband with the household expenses.  She also notes that she sells in different markets around her community.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Martina says that the loan that the Fundaci\u00f3n is giving her will be invested in various fruits and vegetables.  She says that she is very happy about this loan, because sales are high right now as she has been going to other locations to sell with her son, who helps her.  She says that she stocks up on fruits and vegetables in the central supply store in the village of Zitacuaro, where they give her low prices so that she can make some profit.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to have a stable stall in one of the village markets, so that she doesn't have to spend so much on transporting her products.  She says that she is very grateful for the loans which the financing institution has made to her, because her business has been growing bit by bit.  \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are called Lazaro, Rosalba and Leopoldo.  They will invest their loans in their businesses: a stationery store, a grocery store, and buying and selling second-hand clothing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5175,"image":{"id":1034921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase seasonal fruits and vegetables such as avocado, lettuce, green chili peppers, tomatoes, cactus, plantains, mandarins, oranges, beans, and apples, peaches, melons, guavas, and more","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":5175,"lender_count":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lazaro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leopoldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":66000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5803.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6131.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6264.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6399.27},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6537.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6678.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6822.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6969.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7120.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7273.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":455.02},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":501.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":523.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":546.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":558.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":570.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1928.74,"local_amount":24598.4,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":24691.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656761,"comment":null},{"amount":1036.23,"local_amount":13215.72,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":13265.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317433,"comment":null},{"amount":1081.43,"local_amount":13792.14,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13844.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418817,"comment":null},{"amount":1128.6,"local_amount":14393.74,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14447.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568410,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T14:09:23Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:45:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409833,"name":"Nube Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nube Luz tiene 45 a\u00f1os  de edad y vive con su familia en una comunidad de la provincia de Guanacaste llamada Guaitil.

They all live in the home that she owns in the rural community of Yavirironi, R\u00edo Negro Distrcit \u2013 Satipo.  Esther is an organized and hardworking woman.  She has been making her living in agriculture for more than 20 years.  She has 3 plots of land on which she plants coffee, cacao and annatto.  Producing these three products is very profitable, but each harvest is annual. Esther plants her fields in such a way that the harvests coincide with the months of greatest expense.  For example, she harvests the coffee in May and June, the cacao in April, May and June and the annatto in October and November.  That way they have the money to invest in other plantings.\r\n\u201cI have been farming coffee for 10 years.  Now I am harvesting 12 sacks.  The cacao gives me 350 kilos a year,\u201d she says.\r\nOne of her problems is low prices.  Annatto is getting 4 soles per kilo, but in better times gets 7 or 8 soles per kilo.  Thanks to her other crops, she can compensate for said inconvenience.\r\nEsther is currently thinking of renewing her coffee crop with a new crop of small coffee plants.  This will be her first loan from MFP, and so she promises to be punctual with her monthly payments.  She is happy to be a part of the communal bank \u201cInkani\u201d, whose members are responsible people.\r\nEsther will invest the money in the purchase of 10,000 little coffee plants to renew her crop.  With the rest, she will pay the day laborers who will help her with this strenuous work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1019704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase 10,000 little coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T22:50:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455774,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-03T22:04:45Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399784,"name":"Blanca Ines","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca es una persona que a pesar de todas las adversidades que le ha presentado la vida, ha tenido la fortaleza para salir adelante y continuar progresando.

Srey is a 62-year-old farmer who lives in the Baray district of Kompong Thom. Mrs. Srey and her husband help each other in the farming business. From this occupation, they are able to make revenue of around 4 USD per day to use for the family\u2019s expenses. \n\nThis couple has given birth to four children: three of the children are married and one is single. One of the children is grocery seller in a market of Phnom Penh city. She sells groceries, including household things especially materials for using in the kitchen.

She is a very responsible woman and for that reason, does not permit minors to enter her establishment. Maria has always upheld social norms and respected her obligations. Her business is located in her house where she prepared a space for attending to her customers.

She is also happy and friendly.  She is in a common-law marriage with Eduardo, who transports cargo for a living.  He is the father of their 8 children, the majority of which are now independent.  She lives with her youngest son, Javier, who is 30, in their own home.  Elva raises chickens.  She has a small shed that has a maximum capacity of 200 chickens, which is located in back of her home.  There she raises them and sells them at markets in the area, managing to sell all of her production.\r\n\r\nElva stated her business with her own capital that was the fruit of her savings more than 33 years ago.  She also has the support of Eduardo, who is in charge of cleaning and feeding the chickens.  She considers her business to be rather profitable due to the demand that this product has.  It is consumed in mass as part of the daily diet of the population.  What she likes most about her job is being able to have extra economic income for her home's expenses.  On the other hand, what she doesn't like is that sometimes part of her production dies due to plagues, and she has occasional losses.  This is why she had to start over thanks to the support of Microfinanzas Prisma.  She has plans to continue her work and to make some repairs and improvements to her shed.  This will be her twelfth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she hopes that through it she can make her plans concrete.  She will make all of her payments on time so she can have a good credit record.  She feels very good about her communal bank.  She thinks the members are sociable and supportive.  With the requested amount of 1,000 PEN, she will invest in the repair of her shed's infrastructure.

Together they have three children whom they care for in their own home, which is located in the town of Tambo. \n\nShe runs her business out of her house so that she can spend time with her children and educate them. She makes a living selling basic products in her grocery store. Meanwhile, her husband opened an automotive shop at the side of their house. They have dedicated many years to their businesses and hope to be able to develop them more. During her 12 years of experience, Miriam was able to learn everything necessary to save money and improve her income. She buys food in bulk so that she can sell it at slightly lower prices than the other stores. Having invested all her capital to increase her merchandise, she is now seeking support for her children's studies. \n\nThis is her ninth loan with MFP, where she is pleased to receive economic support to grow her business. Moreover, she promises to be punctual with her payments, as her communal bank is comprised of responsible and supportive people. Upon receiving support, Miriam will use the money she requested to buy school supplies for her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1017969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

He has a small store in their home, where he attends to the needs of his neighbors, who are his main customers.  He also fishes with a small boat.  He considers his grocery business to be very profitable since there isn't a similar business in their area.  He likes his job.  Attending to the public distracts him, but more importantly, he feels productive because he can pay for his home's expenses.  He has plans to expand and convert his store into a mini-market where he can sell a variety of products.  This will be his third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He is happy to be able to have their support.  He promises to make all of his payments on time.  With the requested amount of 4,000 PEN, he will invest half in the purchase of basic groceries to stock his store so it will be able to keep growing.

She's separated from the father of her four children - Monica, 28; Luis, 26; Walter, 21; and Nancy, 14. She lives comfortably with her children in the home she owns. Doris's work is selling food like daily prepared breakfasts. She works every day in front of her home, where she amiably tends to her customers, mostly her neighbors and passersby whose preference she has won. She started more than 28 years ago with her own capital, and later took out bank loans that allowed her to continue with her work. Now she has the support of an assistant to prepare the food and attend to the customers who pay per work week. Her business is pretty profitable and gives her a good income. \r\n\r\nShe likes her business a lot because she enjoys cooking and making new types of meals to surprise her customers. What she wants most right now is to increase the size of her business and open a restaurant in her home where she can give her customers more comfort. This will be her 13th loan with MFP. She hopes for a small loan to help her achieve her objectives. For her part, she promises once again to make her payments as she did with previous loans. She is grateful to be part of the village bank because all of the members are responsible and united. With the requested 2000 nuevos soles she will buy cooking implements as well as tables and chairs to grow and improve her business and give her customers better service. She will also fix her roof because it rains a lot in that area."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1021379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cooking implements, tables and chairs, and to fix the roof on her building.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T04:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T04:20:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":290.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":319.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":344.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":366.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.11,"local_amount":290.97,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":291.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714074,"comment":null},{"amount":120.32,"local_amount":320.84,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":321.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202974,"comment":null},{"amount":121.11,"local_amount":322.97,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":323.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098645,"comment":null},{"amount":128.01,"local_amount":341.36,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":342.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401489,"comment":null},{"amount":134.09,"local_amount":357.57,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":358.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455790,"comment":null},{"amount":137.36,"local_amount":366.29,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":367.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451457,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Because Mar\u00eda\u2019s husband\u2019s income was insufficient to cover all household expenses, she started a business selling food hoping to generate income and contribute economically.  The fast food business generated good income for a time but due to circumstances beyond her control she had to close it.  Since then, Mar\u00eda has sought ways to be able to contribute economically to her home so that her family would be able to enjoy a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis led to her setting up a sewing workshop motivated by teachings she received from a family member on how to do this activity and thanks to it she can today count on higher income for her home.  She provides sewing services for third parties in her shop and thanks to the good quality of her work has had very good sales.  So much so that she needs to hire an employee for her shop so is looking for a loan so that she can buy an overlock sewing machine to provide work tools for the person she\u2019s going to hire.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda hopes that in this way she will be able to improve the quality of life not only of her family but also for other people who are more in need.

In time, he hopes his children will become upstanding citizens and have a better quality of life which is why he spends most of his time in his field seeing to his crops development.  \r\n\r\nThis will be loan #5 with MFP.  He is thankful for the trust placed in him to continue working and reaching his objectives.  He will use the requested loan to buy coffee plants to increase his cultivated fields and amass more production in his upcoming harvests."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1021444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":169.29},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":175.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":184.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":186.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":199.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":202.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":210.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":219.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":225.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":234.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":242.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":249.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.79},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":131.01,"local_amount":344.77,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":350.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714080,"comment":null},{"amount":70.1,"local_amount":184.46,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":187.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202980,"comment":null},{"amount":71.85,"local_amount":189.09,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":192.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098650,"comment":null},{"amount":75.66,"local_amount":199.11,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":202.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401495,"comment":null},{"amount":77.6,"local_amount":204.22,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":207.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455795,"comment":null},{"amount":82.57,"local_amount":217.29,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":220.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451463,"comment":null},{"amount":83.71,"local_amount":220.29,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":223.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446643,"comment":null},{"amount":86.88,"local_amount":228.63,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":232.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052658,"comment":null},{"amount":91.56,"local_amount":240.94,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":244.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187763,"comment":null},{"amount":179.06,"local_amount":471.2,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":478.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121624,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-13T15:28:35Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:32:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400632,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria, de 25 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy responsable y activa; vive en su propia casa junto a su pareja Alberto de 32 a\u00f1os y sus 03 hijos a quienes desea brindarles una mejor calidad de vida.

She is married, and tells us that she and her husband support their two children, who are the reason why they both work very hard. She is very satisfied with her business, and with the training that the group receives. \r\n\r\nShe is applying for the loan, because she wishes to supply her grocery store, as she doesn't want to lose any customers. She wishes to buy dairy products, baked goods, vegetables, fruit, and other basic household products. The group is very happy about the help they receive."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":1050988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy supplies for her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Mariano R.
