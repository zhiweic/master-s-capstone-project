Ainagul has a high school education.  The main source of income for Ainagul's family is cattle raising, which she started 12 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 10,000 som (KGS).  Her spouse is helping her with running this business.  Thanks to Ainagul's hard work, she currently has two milk cows and 20 sheep.  Ainagul has all of the necessities to keep livestock in her house.  Ainagul milks the cows herself and sells the milk to daily, which provides some additional income.  Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS).  In order to advance her business, Ainagul turned to the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to buy a horse.  A horse will help with grazing of the cattle in the fields.  Profits from her business, Ainagul plans to reinvest to increase the headcount of her herd.

because lately, he has financial problems.  He is 51 years old, married and is raising six children.  The climate of his region is favorable to raising crops and raising cattle.  For more than 10 years, Abdurauf has been raising livestock.  He sells milk to his neighbors, who are very grateful for having access to naturally produced milk.  Also, he fattens cattle for a few months and then sells it.  Beside these activities, he also keeps bees, and at the moment, he has 40 bee houses.  He has many clients at the market.  He wishes to advance his business further, but has no financial means to do so.  He is asking for a loan of $1,700 dollars (USD) to purchase cattle in order to expand his enterprise.  He is waiting for your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1488373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He is married and has a five-year-old child. Rajabali and his family live in his parents' house, and there he keeps livestock. Rajabali has been keeping livestock and farming for about two years. However, his primary occupation and main source of income is keeping the livestock. Since childhood, Rajabali has been helping his father work in the barnyard, and he has learned a lot from his father. He only started doing this as a business two years ago. Currently, Rajabali has few cattle, so he has decided to take out a loan to increase his livestock and thereby increase his income.

She has extensive experience in agriculture. Burmakan has a secondary education. The livestock business is the family's primary source of income. Burmakan started it 26 years ago when she bought 4,000 KGS worth of livestock. Because of Burmakan's hard work, her farm currently boasts five dairy cows, two mares, and 23 sheep. Every year from April to September, Burmakan milks the mares to make the traditional drink called \"kumis\" to sell. Kumis is a very nutritious and healthy drink. She milks the cows year-round and sells the milk. She earns a monthly income of 6,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Burmakan approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a horse for breeding. Burmakan plans to invest profits from this loan into increasing her livestock, and she plans to save enough money to buy a new home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1488438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy a horse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kurulush village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-11T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burmakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T02:23:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":644476,"name":"Kayirma","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0430\u0439\u044b\u0440\u043c\u0435 54 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 1 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0430, \u0441\u044b\u043d-\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a. \u0423 \u041a\u0430\u0439\u044b\u0440\u043c\u044b -

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

This will enable her to provide for her and her child\u2019s needs. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to someday grow the business and create employment opportunities in her community\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1488776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase bales of clothing for her stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"wedza","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":305,"posted_date":"2013-12-12T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-10T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nomatter","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T12:14:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656277,"name":"Bobby","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bobby is from Plaridel.

I grew up with my parents instilling me with good values that put me on the right path.<br \/><br \/>Since I started school, I always got good grades and was successful every year. After I finished secondary school, I had another goal: to be a professional and study at a private university. My dream career is in Systems Engineering, but this presented my first obstacle because I don't have the economic resources to afford it. Of the four of us who live in my household, my mother is the only one who works. She has put all her efforts into moving us forward and instilling us with values, challenging our economic situation. Despite her efforts, her income isn't enough to sustain a household of four. Her income comes from taking care of the elderly.<br \/><br \/>For this reason, I came to Fundapec to request a Kiva education loan in the hopes that nothing is impossible if you ask. I am convinced that education is the foundation for development and I, as a young person, want to have a better future than the youth who live in my neighborhood.

Because of many costs, she isn't able to do it by herself and that's the reason she asks for this loan. \n\nNaira has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan is very important for Naira's further work and she hopes for lenders' support.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1508551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for new flower seeds and flowers for selling to customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Goris","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2014-01-11T07:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-10T07:30:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7433.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11087.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10823.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10989.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11285.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11452.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":11388.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11790.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11754},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12238.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12319.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":12327},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12684.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13022.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":12858.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13379.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13397.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":13552.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13894.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14021.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":14235.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":14475.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":14689.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":14899.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T20:19:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656285,"name":"Nelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of six children, Nelia works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business where she manufactures brooms in the Philippines, and she also earns additional income from pig fattening.

husband are raising 3 children.  Her eldest, Nursultan, is 17; her youngest son, Bekbolsun, is 13; and her only daughter, Aizirek, is 15.  All her children are in school.  Salkinay has a secondary level education and goes through life with optimism. She knows what she wants and goes after it will everything she has.  Salkinay knows how to plan and properly use her money to reach her goals.\r\n\r\nHer family's main income is Salkinay's animal husbandry business, which she started 16 years ago with the purchase of 10,000 som (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today Salkinay has 5 milk cows and 15 sheep, and she has everything necessary for raising cattle:  a barn for keeping them and nearby pastures.  She keeps the milk cows at home all year so she can look after them herself, but she sends the sheep off with a shepherd from March through October.  Plenty of hay and feed are always ready.  Her monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Salkinay applied to microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to buy calves to increase the size of her herd.  She plans invest the profits from the loan in further increasing the number of cattle she owns, and to save up money to build a new house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1489072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kurulush village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-12T12:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-10T12:50:05Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salkinay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-12T17:12:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656325,"name":"Kissanga Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salma, who is in her early 30's, is a divorcee with three children who are still in school.

She is 58 years old and has been farming since she was little because this was her family\u2019s way of life and they worked on the fields to earn a living.  Thanks to this, she has her own farm where she raises different products, especially avocados, and sells the harvest in her local market.  She always finds a way to get ahead, despite the challenges and difficulties that present themselves due to climate changes that damage her crops and because of the high cost of required supplies.\r\n\r\nHowever, Luz continues to move forward and she is asking for a loan to buy the supplies she needs in quantity (fertilizers, pesticides, compost) and more avocado trees.  This will allow her to increase her production and she will be able to continue caring for her crops and increase her harvests so she can bring more food into the marketplace.\r\n\r\nLuz says that her purpose is to continue working on her farm and make her harvest more productive and profitable so she, her husband, and five children can have better living conditions and wellbeing."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1509336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farming supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-01-11T15:30:38Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-10T15:30:38Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":47979},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":49306},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50670},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":52072},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":53512},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":54992},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":56514},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":58077},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":59683},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":61334},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":63031},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":64774},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66566},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":68407},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":70299},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":72244},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":74242},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":76298}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.94},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-14T21:27:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645246,"name":"Sylvain","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Jeune homme de 27ans, Sylvain est revendeur des accessoires de voitures.

Though there are some risks in cultivating potatoes, she still prefers to use more farmland for this business because potatoes are in great demand in her area as well as a popular vegetable used in most of the Indian dishes.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to give proper education to her children, upgrade their lifestyle and purchase land for expanding their farm.\r\n\r\nShe thanks BJS and Kiva for the loan that can make her dreams true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1509483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase potato seeds and fertilizers for starting cultivation of potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-01-11T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-10T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purnima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-11T20:51:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":644496,"name":"Shakeela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shakeela is a 25-year-old, hard-working housewife.

The investment will allow her to offer a wider range of products and meet demand from local shoppers.  Her margins will go up, she says, and she will use the profit to reinvest in the business and help provide for her family.
