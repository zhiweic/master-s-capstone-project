He is 57 and has a wife and adult children. Islom is a farmer and he works a small plot of land. As with many villagers, his property includes two cows for his family's needs. In addition to his current work, Islom now wants to buy and sell big-horned cattle in order to improve his family's financial situation. His starting capital is $450.

Klara has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 20 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Klara's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and 10 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 14,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Klara requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a cow for increasing livestock headcount. Klara plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and to save money for her son's

She has worked the land for more than 15 years and her specialty is growing coffee as well as making plant nurseries in season. They grow corn and beans for their own consumption as well as to sell sometimes. They acquired the land little y little and started with a small parcel that was inherited from her parents. They were the ones who taught her to work the land. Today her property is approximately 1.05 hectares of cultivated land thanks to their hard work day to day. They sell their product to middlemen and their crops are grown around their house. This facilities getting a better result with the yield, involving all of the family members and avoiding the cost of hiring more workers.\r\n\r\nLucila's dream is for her children to be able to go to school and improve their quality of life, as well as to leave them a strongly established inheritance.

Recently, he decided to go into business for himself and created Reanimator Media, a media company out of his new residence, Houston, Texas. Originally from Los Angeles, Calif., Adam works with one of the top acting agencies, which he says allows him to network with more musicians, actors and people they know.  \r\n\r\nAt 25 years of age, Adam says he can\u2019t say exactly how many artists he\u2019s worked with throughout the entire span of his business, but he says he\u2019s worked with at least 20 bands within the past 12 months. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and recently decided to make it a full-time deal,\u201d he says. And since he is new to having a registered business, Adam had to learn how to obtain more capital. \r\n\r\nWhile doing an online search for lenders, he found nonprofit microlender, Accion Texas Inc. Once he applied and was approved, he was able to rent a studio, pay monthly fees and charge other bands for his services and facilities. Before the Accion loan, Adam was paying studio fees by the amount of time spent;, and the fees quickly added up. But his Accion venture will save the business money, which could be used on Adam\u2019s one full-time employee, or anywhere else.\r\n\r\nAdam\u2019s business, however, isn\u2019t just for musicians looking to record their latest album. Adam\u2019s skills allow him to manage sound and lighting equipment for live shows, and his networking skills allow him to always stay employed. He says since he\u2019s worked with many other artists, bands are learning the name Reanimator Media and are seeking him when they need to rent equipment.\r\n\r\nAdam has plans to market his business through a clothing line named Occeus Couture. Accompanying Occeus\u2019 owner, their main designer will travel from Florida to Houston to open a new store. And to promote their upcoming grand opening, Reanimator was hired to complete marketing projects. Adam says this will help both businesses. The campaign will try to show other companies that his business doesn\u2019t work solely with bands, but with major companies as well.

She has been involved with someone since she was 15 years old. Coming from that relationship, she has six year old daughter who currently studies in the first grade in the community school, which is about 50 meters from where they live.\r\n\r\nHer partner works in construction and also agriculture. Her in-laws also live in the house where she lives with her daughter and partner. Thanks to her efforts and those of her partner, they have managed to build a home on the land of her in-laws.\r\n\r\nLeivi comes from a family of eight siblings (three brothers and five sisters); she is the last sibling in the family. She grew up farming. She studied until the seventh grade.\r\n\r\nShe works selling pupusas (a treat made from stuffed corn dough) and other traditional treats during the afternoons four times a week in the community where she lives. She learned this thanks to her older sister, who taught her the job. She decided to do this because she already had her own home and had to help her partner to get by. She also works raising pigs and poultry, which she grows and fattens so that she can then sell them. At this point she has three years of experience.\r\n\r\nShe buys the supplies for her pupusa sales in the closest city. She has to walk twenty minutes to get to the street where she catches a bus. The bus travels around 40 minutes to arrive and buy the supplies. She does this once a week.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is asking for is to buy three pigs, valued at $225.00. She needs the rest of the money to construct a snack shop in the community from wood and metal sheeting. She can sell traditional snacks and pupusas to her customers, because the neighborhood is in a high-traffic area near the community school.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will get a higher income, which will allow her to give her daughter a better quality of life. She will also contribute to the support of her home.\r\n\r\nShe plans to have a stronger business in the future, where she can offer her customers basic staples. She dreams of being able to give her daughter an education and to improve her house little by little."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":38.82,"image":{"id":1429586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy three pigs valued at $225.00.

","en":"Zarina is 43 years old and married.  She, her husband, and children live in Vahdat, a city not far from the capital.  Her husband works as an administrative manager in the school their children attend.  Zarina had her own business until six years ago when circumstances forced her to close it.\r\n\r\nNow she has decided to restart her business, since her children have already grown up a bit and she can dedicate herself to her business.  To realize her goal, Zarina applied for a loan.  She already has her own shop.  With the loan funds and her own savings, Zarina wants to buy grocery items in order to open her store and start selling.  She plans on expanding her business in the future and open a second store.

She also would go with a machete to the hills to prepare the soil and sow the corn and bean crops.\r\n\r\nCurrently, with the help of her children she has sown 7,000 square meters of corn and 3,500 of beans. Every single day she has to keep watching and waiting for her crops.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for is to buy three pigs ($225.00) and poultry ($100.00); she will invest the rest in farming.

Mar\u00eda has had little formal education, as she only studied until the fourth grade at her community primary school.\r\n\r\nShe has set up a business selling pupusas [thick filled corn tortillas] at weekends in her mother's house. She also sells fresh fish, which she buys from some artisanal fishermen at the lake. She used to work as an employee at a very popular community canteen, and studied in the afternoons for a time. Later, she didn't want to study any more because of work, and dedicated herself to working with her mother for some time. \r\n\r\nShe has been working at these different commercial activities since she was young, since her mother worked and continues to work at these activities too. When Mar\u00eda got together with her partner, she decided to be as independent as possible and to help with household expenses, since construction work is not always constant. Her partner goes through some days when he doesn't have work, and with the expenses related to their daughters and basic services, they need to have a constant flow of income.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is asking for this loan to buy fresh fish for resale and inventory for selling pupusas.

She was only able to study up to first grade and did not finish primary school because her family had various financial problems and they were poor.   Her husband didn\u2019t complete primary school either as he only studied until fifth grade.  They have two children.  Their eldest son is 32 and lives in another country and he helps them with expenses.  The younger son completed third grade but he didn\u2019t like school, so he decided to work the land like his parents. Their income is dependent on coffee cultivation, although they also have a small general store that generates additional family income.  The family engages in various activities such as cleaning, cutting, pruning, and applying fertilizer and manure, which helps them maintain their crops.  They own the land that they work.   They inherited some land from Maria\u2019s parents, and with the profits from the first coffee harvest, they bought another parcel.  Their crops are a fifteen minute drive from their home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s goal and purpose is to tend to her coffee crops and sow new coffee plants to expand her crops because her family is very dependent on this work.  With the income from the production, she plans to make a terrace in the back of her house so that once the beans are cut and washed, she will have a space in which to dry them.  For this reason, today she has requested a loan from the Comixmul cooperative, with which she will purchase 3 quintals of urea, 6000 units of coffee plants, 3 quintals of 12-24-12 formula, and 3 quintals of 18-24-0 formula [types of fertilizers].  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1429589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase new coffee plants, and purchase inputs to maintain the planted crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-14T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-14T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Aida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-15T03:13:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605572,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nancy lives in the Likoni area in Kenya.

Daniela is 19 years old, married and has a young daughter who is not yet in school. Daniela explains that she went to school until secondary school, and when she grew up it was difficult for her to find a well-paid job where she could also have days off. So she decided she should open a laundry service, which she established out of her parents' house since she could set up a room for it there. \r\n\r\nWith her own business, Daniela was able to keep an eye on her house and her family. She says that she started this type of business because she once worked in a laundry and she saw that, though it was a difficult job, it was profitable. She is now requesting a loan, and says that it was her sister who invited her to join her group, Poetas, in order to ask for it, as she saw that Daniela was having some problems with her washing and drying machines. Daniela says, \"At the moment I am having a lot of problems with turning in the laundry on time, since it takes me a bit longer because two dryers and a washer have broken down, and I need capital to be able to fix them, so I can finish my pending work and not let my clients down.\"\r\n\r\nShe will also invest in products for washing clothes. She says her dream is to be able to buy three washer-dryer combos-- new ones, as the ones she has, she bought used. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Rodrigo, Irma, Ricarda, Teresa, Eduardo, Beatriz, Elizabeth, Pablo, and Roberto. They will invest their part of the loan in their businesses of buying car parts and oils, running a hair salon, buying and selling frozen foods, buying material and liquids for a unisex beauty salon, buying supplies to make traditional corn-based Mexican dishes, buying sweets and fried foods to sell, stocking seasonal fruits and vegetables and stocking clothes and shoes to sell by catalog."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7300,"image":{"id":1423178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","use":"to maintain washers and dryers and to buy laundry supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-14T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-14T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":7300,"lender_count":189,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodrigo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":7300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1825,"local_amount":23750,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":23830.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227968,"comment":null},{"amount":2281.25,"local_amount":29687.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":29787.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991813,"comment":null},{"amount":1368.75,"local_amount":17812.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":17872.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644461,"comment":null},{"amount":1825,"local_amount":23750,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":23830.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877921,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T02:30:52Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605587,"name":"Kumomoru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kumomoru is 35 years old, married to Eunice and a father of four.

She is the mother of seven children who attend the community elementary school and are in various grades.  She is a housewife and farmer, with six years of elementary education in total.  For over ten years, she and her husband and children have been engaged in planting vegetables such as potatoes, broccoli, and cauliflower.  She learned from her parents at a very young age because they have been farmers all their lives and the family has been engaged in farming for generations.

He has six years\u2019 experience in this business and has learned how to care for his crops, especially good quality pumpkins that he nourishes with organic manure.\r\n\r\nHe currently has four hectares in cultivation and he wants to continue planting more because he\u2019s hoping for a good season this year.  \u201cAgriculture is a bit difficult; one has to wait several months to earn profits.  This is why I started the business of buying and selling cattle, especially all types and sizes of bulls,\u201d he states.  He now hopes to increase his herd size and to increase the number of small animals because he earns good daily profits selling animals.\r\n\r\nThis is his second Kiva loan and he\u2019s very happy to have financial support since he\u2019s always shown himself to be responsible with his payments.  Jhosep will use the money to buy organic manure for his crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":435.12,"image":{"id":1429789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-14T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-14T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhosep","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":379.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":401.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":412.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":430.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":443.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":459.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":479.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":491.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":138.42,"local_amount":379.99,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":385.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353819,"comment":null},{"amount":146.36,"local_amount":401.76,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":407.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905581,"comment":null},{"amount":150.34,"local_amount":412.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T10:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":418.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091568,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T19:47:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607001,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La clienta vive en casa propia con su familia, desde hace 3 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de frutas y verduras en el mercado de su municipio, es una persona muy trabajadora, responsable y honesta siempre est\u00e1 buscando la manera de poder ayudar a su familia en los gastos de la casa, por esa raz\u00f3n decidi\u00f3 poner su negocio, tiene mucha clientela que la buscas porque sus productos son muy frescos, la clienta est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de papas, ejotes, tomates, g\u00fcisquiles, pipianes, melocotones, frijoles, etc. para poder tener m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda que ofrecer a sus clientes y as\u00ed obtener mejores ganancias y seguir ayudando a su familia en lo que necesiten sin limitaci\u00f3n alguna.","en":"This client lives with her family in her own house.

","en":"Gulchehra is an honest, conscientious woman. She is 41 years old. She is married and raising 3 children. Her children, Golib, Olim and Durdona, still do not have a source of income. Her husband Rustam grows onions and wheat. Gulchehra has over 15 years of experience in animal husbandry. She has a great deal of experience in this business. Gulchehra fattens cattle for several months and then sells them on the local market at a higher price.

She lives in the small village of Khobi with her husband and daughter. The family is involved in agriculture, and has a milking cow and two calves. She milks the cows every day and produces dairy products for sale. They also have a hectare of agricultural land, where they have 250 nut trees and 300 mandarin trees. They sell the harvested products at a good price. Because their income is seasonal and not enough for the family, Mtvarisa has decided to start her own business. She has sought credit from local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. This startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people and inexperienced entreprenneurs to get a loan for starting or re-starting a businesses.

Calixta is a 20-year-old member of the group who is married with two little boys who are the light of her eyes. Her business is animal husbandry which she was attracted to four years ago. She reports that it was difficult to raise animals as she did not have the necessary funds to do so properly. Calixta was greatly heartened to find Friendship Bridge and joined the \u201cCampamento\u201d Trust Bank. She is currently starting her second loan cycle. Calixta will use her loan to purchase at least two pigs, a dozen chickens, turkeys as well as food to fatten them quickly. In this way, she will be able to provide a steady income which will serve the many needs of the family. In addition, she wants to begin saving money for the education of her sons.\r\n\r\nCalixta is quite excited that her business is growing. Currently, she has 42 animals, including turkeys, pigs and many chickens. \"My animals are well fed and people already know the quality of the product I sell so my animals are sold quickly when I go to the market.

Each one of them attends school and the oldest daughter is in college. Juliana is thrilled with their educational progress. Juliana works in the textile industry and manufactures beautiful, traditional Guatemalan blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d (pronounced \u201cwee-peeles) from various villages including her own. She also makes the pretty, adorned aprons that the women wear as part of their daily attire. Juliana not only manufactures and sells her products in her usual venue but also takes special orders as well which she delivers every eight days.\r\n\r\nJuliana\u2019s business is progressing well and looking toward the future, she realizes that she needs to keep injecting financial capital to it. For that reason, she is applying for her 3rd loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and is requesting a loan of US$720. She will use the funds to buy different kinds of fabrics, yarns, and beads to decorate the huipiles. Juliana is excited at this opportunity to as it will allow her to sustain and grow the business. The income generated will be used to provide a better quality of life for the family including opportunities for improved healthcare and education. One of the biggest achievements that Juliana has achieved is having her 20-year-old daughter in law school. Juliana and her husband are making it a priority to keep each of their six children in school as they are aware that this is a real key to a more successful future for them. Juliana only attended school through the sixth grade as her parents thought that was enough time for her.\r\n\r\nJuliana is the Secretary and Member of the Board of Directors of the \u201cBuganvilias\u201d Trust Bank. She, along with the rest of the members of the group, are most excited to receive new loans. Many of the ladies are involved in textile production and will use their loans to sustain and improve their business. They are most grateful for this opportunity and look forward to a more successful future for themselves, their families and their community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":870.03,"image":{"id":1427997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy different kinds of fabrics, yarns, and beads.
