It will also be easier to move the product. Her life will improve because she will be able to obtain savings by moving and organizing her harvest smoothly.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to have her harvest processed in her home.

Elephant Energy is a Namibian Trust that employs a market-based approach to spreading access to affordable energy technologies in rural areas throughout Namibia. These are technologies that improve the quality of life for people living without electricity, who are forced to rely upon costly, inefficient, and health-hazardous energy sources such as candles, kerosene, and single-use batteries.  Because of the barriers imposed by Namibia\u2019s vast distances and limited transportation network, Elephant Energy\u2019s strategy focuses on a highly decentralized network of village-based energy entrepreneurs who bring both education and products to their communities.\r\n\r\nGottlieb lives in Oshakati, Namibia with his wife and children. He has been an actor in rural development over the past 16 years and is driven by his passion for delivering renewable energy solutions to Namibia\u2019s rural areas. Amazingly, he has worked in rural areas in all 107 constituencies in Namibia, which has brought him a keen understanding of the realities faced by the many thousands of Namibians who live off the electric grid. Gottlieb understands both the social and technical sides of solar energy, is skilled in installing, maintaining and repairing solar home systems, and has a keen awareness of what drives and motivates the adoption of new energy practices by rural families. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase the inventory needed to expand Elephant Energy\u2019s rural entrepreneur model to six new regions of Namibia that are home to the majority of Namibia\u2019s unelectrified population. This is part of Elephant Energy\u2019s strategy to provide improved energy alternatives to 10,000 homes (or 50,000 individuals) in the year 2013.\r\n\r\nBarefoot Power is a valued partner because they provide products that are in high demand by Namibia\u2019s off-grid populations. The products are sturdy and rugged enough to withstand Namibia\u2019s harsh desert environments, affordable enough for even the poorest customers to afford, and their focus on integrating cell-phone charging functions provides a huge value-add to these products at a time when the number of rural Namibians with cell phones is rising at a rapid rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7150,"image":{"id":1270161,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2826,"youtubeId":"HdmJ5InSKg4","title":"Kiva Borrower Gottlieb from Namibia","thumbnailImageId":1270161},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy and sell Barefoot Power's solar lighting products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NA","country":"Namibia","town":"Windhoek","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22 17","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T00:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T00:10:01Z","loan_amount":7150,"lender_count":234,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gottlieb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":7150,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":7150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2145},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5005}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2145},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5005}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7150,"local_amount":7150,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419778968,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-03T15:10:46Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513396,"name":"Flor Celina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor, tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposo tiene una hija de 5 a\u00f1os, ella trabaja la alfarer\u00eda y su esposo es agricultor, su horario de trabajo es de 8:00am hasta las 4:00pm, se traslada a vender la mercader\u00eda al mercado.

El grupo se re\u00fane en una colina en donde lo mejor que se puede apreciar es le sol por las tardes. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron las integrantes del grupo y lo eligieron ya que donde viven hay una capilla que tambi\u00e9n se llama El Calvario es donde se celebra la crucifixi\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas en Semana Santa.\n\nDo\u00f1a Elena quien forma parte del grupo \"El Calvario\" platica que tiene 33 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or V\u00edctor desde hace 9 a\u00f1os juntos han formado una familia con tres ni\u00f1os que se encuentran estudiando, Do\u00f1a Elena se dedica a realizar paletas de hielo y helados desde hace 8 a\u00f1os Do\u00f1a Elena las realiza para despu\u00e9s venderlas, comenta que inicio con su actividad porque antes de que se casaran Don V\u00edctor ya se dedicaba a la venta de sus paletas y helados, las paletas y helados son preparados desde dos d\u00edas antes ya que para la elaboraci\u00f3n es todo un proceso como moler la fruta, poner en moldes para despu\u00e9s ponerlos a congelar y finalmente embolsarlos,  preparar el helado, cuando ya tienen sus helados preparados y paletas colocan todo en su carrito y salen a ofrecer al mercado o en la comunidad donde viven sus helados, Do\u00f1a Elena comenta \"Me gusta mucho salir a vender mis helados y paletas y escuchar a las personas decir que les gusta mis productos esa es la mejor satisfacci\u00f3n que obtengo de mis clientes\" Do\u00f1a Elena est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito a la instituci\u00f3n para comprar m\u00e1s material para la realizaci\u00f3n de sus paletas y helados como palos, colorantes, fruta, leche y leche.\nLa dificultad que presenta Do\u00f1a Elena es en la \u00e9poca de frio porque nadie comprar sus productos las personas lo menos que consumen son las cosas fr\u00edas como las paletas y helados, Aunque esto no la detiene a tener sue\u00f1os de llegar alg\u00fan d\u00eda a tener una never\u00eda mas grande esto le ayudara para que sus hijas tengan alg\u00fan d\u00eda una carrera profesional y puedan tener una mejor calidad de vida.

The group meets on a hill where the best thing to appreciate is the afternoon sun. The members chose the name of the group, and they chose it because in the area where they live there is a chapel which is also called The Calvary, and it is where they observe the crucifixion of Jesus during Holy Week.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Elena, who is part of the El Calvario group, relates that she is 33 years old. She has been married to Se\u00f1or Victor for 9 years. Together they have formed a family with three children, who are in school. Do\u00f1a Elena's work for eight years has been making popsicles and ice cream. She makes them to sell, and she comments that she began her business because before they were married Don Victor was already selling popsicles and ice cream. The popsicles and ice creams are made two days ahead of time, since the preparation involves a process of grinding the fruit, putting it into molds to then set it to freeze, and finally putting it in bags. When they have the ice creams and popsicles ready, they gather them in their cart and go out to offer them in the market or in the community where they live. Do\u00f1a Elena comments, \"I very much like to go out to sell my ice creams and popsicles and hear the people say that they like my products. It is the greatest satisfaction that I obtain from my customers.\" Do\u00f1a Elena is applying to the institution for the loan to buy more materials to make her popsicles and ice creams, such as sticks, coloring, fruit, and milk.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty that Do\u00f1a Elena faces is in the cold season, because nobody buys her products, since the last things people want to eat are cold things like popsicles and ice cream. However, this does not stop her from having a dream of someday having a bigger freezer. This will help her so that her daughters can some day have a professional career and have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are very happy with the credit offered, since they will be able to invest in their businesses, such as Do\u00f1a Felicitas, Elia, and Enriqueta in a little grocery store; Cristal in construction tools; Petra, Maria Guadalupe, Luisa, and Margarita in sheep; and Do\u00f1a Alberta in clothes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6750,"image":{"id":1262075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":" to buy plastic bags, fruit, milk, food coloring, etc., to make popsicles and ice cream.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Calvario, San Felipe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T03:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":6750,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristal ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enriqueta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elia Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":86000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2531.25,"local_amount":32250,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":32348.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284941,"comment":null},{"amount":1687.5,"local_amount":21500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":21565.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199228,"comment":null},{"amount":1687.5,"local_amount":21500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":21565.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596023,"comment":null},{"amount":843.75,"local_amount":10750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10782.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663447,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T03:34:19Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513421,"name":"Mar\u00eda Sol","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Sol de 41 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer visionaria y emprendedora.

Lo que no le agrada, seg\u00fan comenta, es que algunas veces no ha logrado pescar lo suficiente para cubrir los gastos de la pesca, muchas veces debido a la escasez de los peces o a la creciente de los r\u00edos, pero eso no la desanima y contin\u00faa hacia delante es por eso que tiene planes de seguir con su negocio.\nEste es el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 3 con MFP, por tanto agradece a quienes hacen posible su cr\u00e9dito para continuar con sus objetivos, por otro lado est\u00e1 muy comprometida una vez m\u00e1s a cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas como lo hizo en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo, est\u00e1 muy contenta de pertenecer a su banco comunal ya que todos sus integrantes son muy buenos, amables y solidarios.\nCon el monto solicitado (S\/. 1800), comprar\u00e1 diversos fardos conformados por prendas de vestir, de esta manera espera seguir trabajando.\n\n","en":"Carmen is 57 years old and is a happy, friendly woman with lots of business experience.  She lives with 55 year old Dennis who is a fisherman, with her parents, and children, ages 20 and 17 in a home that she built with help from her husband and many years of work.\r\n\r\nCarmen sells used clothing in the nearby zones around Los Rios, where she travels frequently by river.  People from these areas request various types of clothing from her.  She buys the clothing in different shopping areas in the city and then sells them in each place she visits.  She\u2019s been doing this for three years.  [Carmen] works alone but travels with her husband, since he is a fisherman; she takes advantage of the time to make her sales while he accomplishes his fishing tasks.  When she is back in town she sells snacks such as cookies, candy, and other things.\r\n\r\nShe likes both businesses because they keep her busy and she started them out of need for having a trade to count on for an income to help pay the household expenses and her children\u2019s education.  What she doesn\u2019t like, she says, is that sometimes there is not enough fish to cover the cost of fishing.  Many times it\u2019s because of the scarcity of fish or the growth of Los Rios, but this does not discourage her and she continues forward.  She plans to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan through MFP and therefore is grateful to those who make this loan possible so that she can continue with her objectives.  She is also very committed to making her payments on time as with the previous loans.  She is very happy to be with the communal bank because all the members are good, friendly, and united.\r\n\r\nShe will use the (S\/. 1,800) to buy bales of clothing and continue working.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1269160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":264.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":287.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":297.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":299.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":320.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":330.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.72,"local_amount":264.96,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":272.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573169,"comment":null},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":287.05,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":295.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122811,"comment":null},{"amount":119.92,"local_amount":297.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":306.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868634,"comment":null},{"amount":120.77,"local_amount":299.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":308.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577468,"comment":null},{"amount":128.9,"local_amount":320.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":329.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529705,"comment":null},{"amount":133.07,"local_amount":330.37,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:11Z","rounded_local_amount":339.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974736,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T16:49:37Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513488,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is from Pandahan, SND.

She started this adventure with her sister-in -law's help, thanks to a loan they obtained. Now they work together, always serving in a friendly manner.\r\n\r\nShe likes the business because it allows her to have some income to pay for the household expenses. She has had a lot of financial needs because of the low income when her husband worked as a cook in a private restaurant. But right now she feels relieved because she has been developing her trade in her own house and it has been very useful. This is her 5th loan with MFP. She is grateful to those who have made access to this loan possible. This way, she will feel more confident advancing at her job. She is also committed to making her payments on time. She also feels very calm and supported by the members of her communal bank.\r\n\r\nWith the amount she has asked for, 500 nuevos soles, she will invest in buying produce and ingredients to prepare food.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1269172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy produce and ingredients to prepare food.

Mahbuba is 51 years old, married, and raising 2 children. She has been working as a high school teacher for over 30 years and loves her job. The local populace respects Mahbuba as an educated and hard-working woman as well as a highly qualified educator. However, for a number of years, Mahbuba has been unable to improve her living conditions due to her and her husband's small salaries, which do not allow them to buy all necessities of life.\r\n\r\nMahbuba would like to start her own business in order to generate additional income. To this end, she took the course \"Succeed\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained her graduation certificate. Now she is quite ready to set up her own business and become successful. Mahbuba would like to start making traditional \"kurpacha\" mattresses as she has experience in this craft. Kurpacha is a mattress used by Tajiks both in bedrooms and in living rooms, and so it is always in high demand. Mahbuba will sew kurpachas and sell them at the local market. She plans to use her additional income to improve her living conditions. She is requesting a loan of 6000 somoni to purchase fabrics for her new business. Mahbuba is counting on your

She is a very hard-working and kind woman. Matluba sews beautiful traditional women's dresses. While she has her own sewing machine, she never engaged in entrepreneurial activity and had no knowledge or skills in this area. However, the world's rapid development has made her take the decision to start her own business. To this end, Matluba took the course \"Succeed\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and received her graduation certificate. Now she is quite ready to launch her own business and succeed in this endeavour.\r\n\r\nMatluba would like to focus her business on sewing and selling women's clothing. She will purchase fabrics, create dresses, and sell them at the local market. Matluba will run her business on her own as her parents are unable to help her. She plans to use her income to improve her living conditions and to accumulate some savings. She is requesting a loan of 4000 somoni to purchase fabrics for her new business. Matluba is counting on your

She is single with one child who is four years old.\r\n\r\nZipporah has requested a loan of 20,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to help her buy piglets for a venture into pig farming. She hopes to gain more income and establish a big pork butchery within the local market. She believes she will be able to improve her family's living standard and educate her child.\r\n\r\nZipporah notes the main challenge is the inadequacy of funds for smallholder farmers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":232.41,"image":{"id":1269509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy piglets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T17:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T17:00:39Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zipporah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1437.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1475.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1514.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1554.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1595.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1638.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1681.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1725.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1771.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1818.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1918.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.39,"local_amount":1471.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1586.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339551199,"comment":null},{"amount":18.88,"local_amount":1510.23,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T08:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1628.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347304908,"comment":null},{"amount":19.38,"local_amount":1550.15,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1671.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355846107,"comment":null},{"amount":19.89,"local_amount":1591.12,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1715.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768482,"comment":null},{"amount":20.41,"local_amount":1633.18,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1760.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516549,"comment":null},{"amount":20.95,"local_amount":1676.35,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1807.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960158,"comment":null},{"amount":21.51,"local_amount":1720.66,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390819869,"comment":null},{"amount":22.08,"local_amount":1766.14,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1904.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400416966,"comment":null},{"amount":22.66,"local_amount":1812.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1954.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980503,"comment":null},{"amount":48.26,"local_amount":3860.75,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4162.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880510,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-03T18:45:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513628,"name":"Mkambe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mkambe is an active woman who is enterprising, dedicated to her work, and a fighter with many goals that she wants to achieve.

is from the Akhalkalaki district. He is 24 years old, married and lives with his parents, grandparents, wife and infant child.  Egor\u2019s income source is the small amount he earns from his grocery store. Besides, his grandparents are provided with a retirement pension. As the existing income is not enough for the family, Egor decided to start a new business. In particular, he plans to finish the renovation of a store and rent it out for a good price. Egor has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. However, his loan request was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, for they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this loan, Egor will install doors and windows in his newly built store and renovate it properly so that it satisfies the personal needs of his clients. A private company has already expressed an interest in renting it. Egor hopes his business will be profitable and this will increase his income, providing his family with enough money to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living

Margarita tells us that a friend invited her to take out a loan in order to improve her avocado trees; this friend saw her trees and said \"These trees are in very bad shape; you need to fertilize them in order to have a good harvest\". Margarita replied \"The truth is that right now I don't have much capital to invest, and everything I would need to keep them in better shape is very expensive\". It was then that her friend invited her to form part of her group, called Chibaty, where they were taking out a loan to improve their businesses. Margarita decided to join because she wanted to improve her trees and thus help her husband to improve their living conditions. She says that she has 58 trees that are already 4 years old, and that they have not yielded much fruit because she has not been able to provide optimal maintenance. When it is harvest time, she goes to the central supply centre of a nearby village and sells her fruit in small bags; her harvest is not very large. She says that she hopes that, with this loan, she will be able to buy everything her trees need, such as fertilizers, manure, insecticides, and Calidra-brand lime. She says that she is grateful to Vision Fund because they will provide this loan. It will be of great use to her and she will benefit greatly. The other five group members are called Mar\u00eda Leucadia, Amelia, Irma, Mar\u00eda Crisanta, and Ausencia.

Yolanda says that she has always lived in the community.  She studied in secondary school.  She married Juan, who works as a mechanic.  They have been married for 22 years and together they formed a family with three children, two of whom are students.\r\n\r\nYolanda has had a grocery store for two-and-a-half years.  She started it because she and her husband talked about setting up the store and decided to do it.  She says it had always been one of her dreams to have her own store that she could run on her own.\r\n\r\nShe asked the institution for this loan to be able to stock her store.  Thanks to the loan she was able to buy detergent, soft drinks, milk, eggs, bread, snacks, etc.\r\n\r\nYolanda commented: \"I remember when I started the store we only had one shelf where we would put the perishables so they wouldn't spoil easily.  In time I managed to buy another counter that was bigger, and little by little I've been buying more things.  Thanks to the loan from the institution, for example, not long ago I got a bigger soft-drink case because the previous one is too small and I wasn't able to have as many soft drinks.\"\r\n\r\nYolanda comments that her biggest challenge is the competition around her, but she always tries to give the best service and have everything her customers request.  She says that one day a girl arrived to buy a pill that she didn't have, so she asked the girl to wait a moment and Yolanda got the pill from another store; it was more expensive, but she did it so she wouldn't look bad to her customer.\r\n\r\nNow her goal is to expand her store.  She thinks she already has all the groceries, and now she wants to add fruits and vegetables to increase her profits so she can help her children with their education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1265719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They are all happily married and live in a small village at the outskirts of Senapati District in the State of Manipur located in the North Eastern part of India. \r\n\r\nHoineikim is the profile member pictured with raised hand. She is 28 years old and is a mother to a son and two daughters. Her husband is a farmer by profession and often collects stones from the river to sell and earn income for the family. In order to supplement the family income, she joined the group to access loans.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she initiated a small store. In her store she sells sugar, milk-powder, 'paan', cigarettes, chewing tobacco and eatables. She managed to repay her loan from the profit and from time to time add to her husband's scanty income. With the second loan, she increased her store's stock and expanded her store with newer varieties to sell. She made progress because her income in terms of profit is doublefold. She was in a position to support her two older children's education and managed the family expenditures all from her business. She also started saving INR 500 on a monthly basis. The saving is done with a group of 30 members. Every month one member gets the collected amount and it continues till every member gets the collected amount. This is one of the trends that poor people here use to somehow try to meet their capital needs.\r\n\r\nHoineikim together with her husband wishes to buy one buffalo for his farming activities and reduce ploughing expenses and also to earn income when ploughing other fields and charging a fixed rate. She also dreams to support her children with good education facilities and for that she means to save as much as possible and is determined to do a good business for the future.\r\n\r\nShe needs loan to expand her store business. She wants to stock groceries items to sell such as potatoes, dal and rice for that matter. Likewise, the rest of her group members too need loan to facilitate their respective income activities. Among the group, four members undertook piggery farming, Two members do weaving, and another two members raise goats to sell and one member sells clothes.        \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1269516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase the store inventory of rice, potatoes, and dal (lentils).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jangvah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neikholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neikholam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhovah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoineikim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lheikhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingkhovah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-05T10:36:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513650,"name":"Ekhlas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ekhlas, who is the applicant for this loan, is a 41-year-old conservative woman.

He says that the group named themselves this because this is what they call their community (it is not the real name of the neighborhood).  He says that he has worked in the buying and selling of avocados and seasonal fruits for a little over four years.  \r\n\r\nHe began this business because he did not have a stable job.  Since he did not study beyond primary school due to scarce economic resources, it is difficult for him to find a good job.  He says that various family members make a living in cultivating avocados.  He rents them the orchards to cut the avocado.  Then, they carry the fruit to sell in a Mexican state where they get a better price.  \r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan to rent an orchard.  The harvest for this fruit already began in the month of December, and he has to put capital together to pay for the rent and then go to sell.  He says that when it is not avocado season, he goes to the wholesale supply center in Zitacuaro to buy tomatoes, manzano chile peppers, onions, pineapple, papaya, strawberries, cherries, blackberries, and more.  He says that he has a small pick-up truck he uses to transport his fruit to areas where he can sell for more than at the street markets.  \r\n\r\nHe says that his goal is to buy land where he can cultivate his own avocados and have a better future.  \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Felipe, Ana Lilia, Guadalupe, and Roberto.

She is about 27 years old and she is a mother to a son and two daughters. Her husband is a farmer by profession and grows rice from an inherited paddy field. During the off season her husband earns money on daily wage. In order to supplement the family income she sells rice house to house. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan she bought rice grains which she took to the mill to separate the husk from the grain. She would also sell from her granary to earn more profits. This is how the family's main source of income is generated. With her earning she managed her children's schooling requirements apart from the family maintenance. She has been saving as much as she could and wishes to purchase a ploughing machine (manually push and control) for her husband in the future. She believes that with the proposed machine she and her family can be in a better position financially. People here still use oxen and buffalo to plough the field. On the other hand the machine can be very convenient with regards to proper tilling of the field.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan to continue her business activities. She also wishes to multiple her income activities for her future plan. With part of the loan she wants to buy at least three piglets to raise and sell for profit.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too need another loan to improve upon their respective income activities. Among the group members three of them are in the rice business and another three are in the weaving sector.

The term literally means 'sunflower'.  They all belong to a TrIbal community. They all live in Thingkanphai village in Manipur state located in the North Eastern part of India. It takes about 3 and half hours' drive to reach it from the main city Imphal and the road connectivity is still characterized with a bumpy ride.\r\n\r\nHatneng is the profiled member, pictured with her hand raised. She is 45 years old and she is a mother to two sons and two daughters whose age is between 19 years to 25 years. The family's main source of income comes from her husband who is a government employee as a clerk under the District Administrative Office. All her children are going to college for a higher degree in the main city. In order to supplement the family income, she has been weaving since 1990. She weaves traditional clothes such as shawls (local name, 'Saipikhup') and wraparounds (local name, 'Khamtang') of varied colours and designs. Her saved income from this trade comes in very handy when her husband's salary is delayed 3 to 4 months at a stretch. The government trend of delayed payment to the employees here in Manipur is making things difficult for the people. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2009, she continued the same activities. Having woven for so long she already earned a good name in and around the neighbouring villages. This goes to say that her market options are well established. With her second loan she increased her production by hiring two more weavers to assist her. Her two daughters, having mastered the art, spent their school vacation weaving.  The method used to weave is that of a back strap loom.\r\nShe wishes and plans that her younger daughter aged 21 years now would go for a professional training in this art. She wants her to learn weaving using the modern techniques of weaving such as weaving by machine. Maybe down the road, she dreams of becoming an entrepreneur by inviting interested companies of such holding and manufacturer. For her future dream she has been saving for quite some time now already.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan to facilitate her weaving activity.

He lives with his wife, 2 children and mother. His mother is provided with a retirement pension. Amiran requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of the low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 2 milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese production. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land where different kinds of vegetables are grown and 5 beehives with bee colonies. They sell the harvested products and cheese locally in an open market at a good price, but it is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistent poor category. \r\n\r\nAmiran requested loan from Credo to start-up a business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-up and re-startup with credits on soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Amiran will purchase a minibus. After the purchase, he will transport people from his village to Batumi and get a salary. He hopes his project will be profitable and the new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of his family.

is 55 years old.

His loan request was always rejected because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nZurab's family is involved in a small-scale agricultural business. They run a family-owned poultry farm with 35 hens and sells on average 100-200 eggs per month.  Zurab also grows maize on the family-owned land and sells seasonally.  In addition, he works as a machine operator and gets a small monthly salary. But it is not enough to provide Zurab and his family with adequate living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistent poor category. \r\n\r\nZurab has requested a loan from Credo to re-start his family business, which was stopped a couple of years ago because of financial problems. His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-up and re-start-up with fewer conditions, to the country's rural poor. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, and they often do not have access to credit. \r\n\r\nWith the credit, Zurab will renovate the shed and purchase chickens to start a poultry farm. He will place the chickens in a shed, raise and sell the chickens for a higher price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":503.52,"image":{"id":1269571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"repair

is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nMeryam is a 21-year-old, married woman with no children yet. Her husband is employed and gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover all their costs. \r\n\r\nMeryam is a university student, specializing in Arts, who wants to complete her studies. She is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from Palestine for Credit & Development (FATEN) to help her cover the cost of purchasing a new laptop. This will help Meryam to do her homework and complete her reports. This will ensure a better future for Meryam and improve her conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Don Silvino se dedica a la cr\u00eda de borregos desde hace mas de 30 a\u00f1os ya que el no estudio porque sus padres no ten\u00edan recursos  y la escuela mas cercana le quedaba en aquel entonces muy retirada de su comunidad. El tiene ahorita 13 borregos y esta pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para darle mantenimiento a su corral ya  que por las inclemencias del clima y por el mal estado de su corral ya se le han muerto varios borreguitos y que en su comunidad hace demasiado frio y cae hielo. Dice  que tambi\u00e9n le comprara alimento, vitaminas, desparacitantes para tenerlos en mejor estado y as\u00ed venderlos a un mejor precio. Platica que en el mes de diciembre es cuando mejor ventas tiene y cuando son las clausuras de las escuelas ya  que  por las fiestas que hacen y las tradiciones de su comunidad hacen demasiada comida e invitan gente de otras comunidades  para festejar las fiestas.

This is because he never studied, as his parents did not have the means to send him to school and the closest one was very far away from his community at that time.  \r\n\r\nAt the moment, he has 13 sheep and is requesting a loan to maintain their pen, because bad weather and its bad state of repair have already led to the death of several lambs, and it is cold and hails in his community. He also says that he will buy food, vitamins, and deparasiting treatments to keep them in better condition and thus sell them for a better price. \r\n\r\nHe explains that in December he makes the most sales and the schools close. Due to the celebrations held and traditions of his community they make a lot of food and invite people from other communities to celebrate the holidays. Don Silvino says that if he gets a loan he can improve his business and he feels grateful to VisionFund. The other members of the group are called Gonzalo, Albina and Eliseo.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Since 2007 she has grown cucumbers and tomatoes.  Her 25-year-old son helps manage the farm.  She began developing the farm by building three greenhouses where they grow young cucumbers.

is a 25-year-old young married man with no children yet. For the past three years, he has been selling home products from his store, which is situated in a good location in the center of the market and is well known among customers. His business is profitable and is his only source of income; however, it needs more support from time to time to cover some costs.\r\n\r\n<p>Momen is requesting a Murabaha loan from FATEN (see below) to cover the cost of purchasing a new collection of home products to sell. This will increase sales and improve his income positively. Momen is photographed inside his store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

His loan request was rejected each time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the small amount earned by David, who works as an artisan. It is hardly enough for food for a four member family. According to Credo's estimations, his family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nDavid requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved because of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, David will purchase a truck. After purchasing this truck, he plans to trade vegetables. He will buy vegetables from wholesalers then transport and resell at better price. This will increase his family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He lives with his wife, 2 children and his mother. On several occasions, Zaza has requested loans from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but has had no success. His loan requests were always rejected because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family's only source of income is from agricultural activities. They have a cow, whose milk is used in dairy products, which they sell locally in an open market at a good price. However, it is hardly enough to feed the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nZaza requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative through Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Zaza will use this loan to purchase tires and an accumulator for his truck. After fixing up his truck, he will be able to get orders and transport goods. This will increase the family's income.

She is originally from an indigenous community located within the boundaries of the state of Michoac\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico, where the majority of the people speak the dialect Mazahua. Elia is a hard working woman and several of the members of the group called T\u2019jiaru invited her because they know that she is a responsible and hardworking woman. She says that it is the first time that she is entering a loan and that she is enthusiastic because with the loan she believes that she will improve her business. She sells secondhand clothing for a living. She says that she began this business because where she worked as a domestic employee in M\u00e9xico City, her customer gifted her clothing and that was not being used and she began to sell to people from her community. After she began to go to the flea market to stock clothing to sell in the community, she said that she sold mostly children's clothes and at prices that are not expensive so her customers can buy more. She says that it is a good business because although her small son is dependent on her, as he is only 3 years old, she can also contribute to the expenses of the house. The other members of the group are named Aurelia, Karina, Alejandr\u00eda, Roc\u00edo and Mar\u00eda Clara.

She is a hard worker and wants to get ahead in life.  She is 44 years old.  Her parents didn't send her to school because people thought at the time that women had to take care of the children and domestic chores.  \r\n\r\nTeresa likes staying at home but she also thought that she would like to make her own money in order to help her spouse with the expenses for the children and house.  For this reason, she decided to grow avocados.  They own a broad plot of land and decided to plant avocados to put the land to use.  Teresa says: \"A little more than 15 years ago I bought avocado plants with the hope that one day they would yield a crop.  Now I am one of the women in my community selling the most avocados, given that I have 150 trees of this fruit.  I am very proud that my husband and I together have made many gains in getting ahead with our garden.  Each year tons of buyers come to our town because we sell very high quality fruit.\"  \r\n\r\nTeresa is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers, organic fertilizers and calidra (to prevent plagues) in order to improve her trees.  She is grateful that with the loan she can improve her business.  The other members of her group include Antolina, Maria Santa, Maria del Carmen, Maria Elena, Gilberta and Teresa.

Seven months ago he decided to invest his savings in the purchase of cakes and sweets that he sells from a room of his house. He has come up with this job idea because his severe backache prevents him from engaging in heavy jobs. Luis hopes that his new project will grant him a goof income as this is the only source of income he has to provide for himself and his family.

All are very responsible and hardworking. They chose this name for the group because Santa Rosa is the patron saint of their town, and she is one of the most famous virgins in the community where they live.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cristina is one of the members. She is 52 years old and has been married to Sr. Silverio for 36 years. They have six children, all of whom have now left home. Cristina has a grocery store which she opened after running her Mexican snacks stall for four years. She says that she very much enjoys selling things and making her customers happy. She is now seeking a loan from the institution to buy more stock for her store such as bread, eggs, milk, soft drinks, and Sabrita snacks.\r\n\r\nShe relates a bad experience she had: \u201cIn the past I had no interest in loans. But then one day I was offered one, and I had to take it because some men stole all my stock. I was left with nothing, so I was forced to take a loan to restart my business.

porque que significa \"Dios esta aqui\" y ademas porque es un grupo que ha durado mucho tiempo trabajando con la institucion, Do\u00f1a Angeles quien es integrante del grupo tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad

have always lived in the community where they meet. They are hard workers with a desire to succeed. The name of the group was chosen by the members however the meaning is not precisely known, they chose it because it means \"God is here\" and because it is a group that has worked for a long time with the institution.\r\n\r\nAngeles, a member, is 55 years old. She has been married for 39 years to Julio and together they have nine children all of whom all are independent.  Angela, as she is commonly known, is an older woman yet this doesn\u2019t stop her from achieving her dreams. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan from the institution to buy more merchandise such as plastic products and household products. Thirty-five years ago Angela decided to sell these products in markets she says because she wanted to help her husband with household expenses and the education of their children so they could have a better quality of life. The difficulty is not having a stable place where they can offer their products as the authorities prevent them from selling outside the market. \r\n\r\nAngela says that not too long ago they were victims of theft in another state. For Angela\u2019s family it was a scare but she thanks God that the thieves did not hurt any family members, they only took the merchandise but for Angela it was a big scare. In spite of this bad experience, she continued selling her articles because for Angela and Julio the most important thing was the welfare of their children, \"One day I would like to have a stable location where my husband and I could sell our merchandise peacefully as we are already seniors. It\u2019s very difficult to walk in the market offering our products.\u201d \r\n\r\nAngela and the group are very pleased for the loan granted as it will help them invest in their businesses; Albino will invest in pillows, Amelia in household products, Felisa and Hermenegilda will invest in remote controls for televisions, and Sabina in electronic products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6575,"image":{"id":1269672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to sell household products such as vasos, spoons, blender cups, etc..","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin Mextepec, San Felipe del progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T02:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T02:00:01Z","loan_amount":6575,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albino","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Felisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermeregilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":84000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":10500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":821.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":821.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":821.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2465.63,"local_amount":31500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31501.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284965,"comment":null},{"amount":1643.75,"local_amount":21000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":21001.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199252,"comment":null},{"amount":1643.75,"local_amount":21000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:06:45Z","rounded_local_amount":21001.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596047,"comment":null},{"amount":821.87,"local_amount":10500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10500.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663473,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T20:59:49Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513896,"name":"Glenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Glenda lives in the Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCriselda operates a buy-and-sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and then sell it for a little profit. Her products are men's and women's clothes and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy ready-to-wear products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCriselda hopes to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She is married to Ricardo, an employee, and is a mother of children. Together with her husband, Elvera manages their household while operating a business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElvera operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal, to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Elvera earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices, and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElvera hopes to have a car and dreams of expanding her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1270001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

The members took the name of their group from the bible, and although they don't know exactly what it mean, they like it.  It is an Evangelical name, and the members believe it is the name of a musician.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Raquel is the representative of the group.  She is 35 years old, married to her husband Ismael for 19 years, and together they have a family with three children, two of which are studying.  Do\u00f1a Raquel has sold blenders and household products for 15 years.  She began her business because, as a child, her parents sold these products and then when she got married, her husband Ismael also sold the same products.  It wasn't difficult for her to adapt to the work.  \r\n\r\nThis time Do\u00f1a Raquel is applying for the loan to buy more products such as tongs, spoons, glasses, blenders, etc.  In regards to the loan, Do\u00f1a Raquel said, \"If they authorize this loan for me and my husband, it will be a great help to be able to invest in our business.  The more products we have, the better our sales will be and we will be able to make the quality of life better for our children.\"  The difficulty for Raquel is when sales fall drastically, and this typically happens in the month of February when they don't sell hardly anything.  She would like to have a bigger shop where she can have more merchandise.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Agustina, Emma, Norma, and Felisa who will all invest in household products, and Angelica who will invest in controls devices."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6125,"image":{"id":1203184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy blenders and household products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":6125,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":78000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":765.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":765.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":765.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2296.88,"local_amount":29250,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":29353.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284942,"comment":null},{"amount":1531.25,"local_amount":19500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":19569.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199229,"comment":null},{"amount":1531.25,"local_amount":19500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":19569.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596024,"comment":null},{"amount":765.62,"local_amount":9750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9784.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663448,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-14T14:55:15Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513921,"name":"Marieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marieta is 40 years old, married with five children.

is 29 years old and married with two dependent children. Chhom lives happily with her family in a village of Reussey district, an area of Phnom Penh. To earn a living, she gets involved in three businesses: being a farmer, a waitress \u2014 taking food orders from clients \u2014 and a pig raiser. From each business, she can generate $2.00 a day on average. Aside from her hardships, Chhom is going to help her children in their education.

She has always fought to excel in life. She is in a common-law marriage with Luis, who is a motorcycle mechanic and with whom she has 5 children, who are already grown and independent. She lives in her own house together with her spouse, 2 daughters, and the husband of one of her daughters. What she desires most is to continue working in order to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nEsther\u2019s work entails designing clothing and sewing for other people. Her work is in high demand in her neighborhood, as she is the only one who does this activity. She learned it when she was very young alongside her mother, and later she studied in an occupational education center. Now, she has her own shop, where she serves her customers with great patience. \r\n\r\nShe began with 1 sewing machine more than 44 years ago, and up to now, she has been working alone. She considers her business to be profitable enough, because the demand for her services leaves her with good earnings.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her business, as she can count on a job and economic income. She still remembers when she started out; she had many doubts and difficulties, but through effort and a lot of work, she was able to overcome them. Apart from having this business, she also works renting rooms and business spaces. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to make her business more well-known and to continue growing. In order to do this, she is prepared to keep working. Therefore, this will be her 18th loan with the organization MFP. From her collaboration, she hopes to continue with her goals. In addition, she is very committed to once more paying off her quotas on time and in a responsible way. She feels very comfortable with her communal bank, since her friends from the group are very responsible and always support each other. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 1500 nuevos soles, she will purchase materials to continue with her sewing work, like fabric, thread, buttons, zippers, elastic, and others - looking for low prices on her bulk purchases - in addition to buying materials to repair part of the infrastructure of the rooms that she rents out. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1269783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase materials to continue with her sewing business, such as fabric, thread, buttons, zippers, elastic, and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T07:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T07:10:14Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":220.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":239.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":248.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":249.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":266.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":274.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.35,"local_amount":220.88,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":225.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573180,"comment":null},{"amount":95.72,"local_amount":239.3,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":243.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122822,"comment":null},{"amount":99.29,"local_amount":248.23,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":253.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868645,"comment":null},{"amount":99.99,"local_amount":249.96,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":254.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577479,"comment":null},{"amount":106.72,"local_amount":266.8,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":272.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529716,"comment":null},{"amount":109.93,"local_amount":274.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":280.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974747,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-06T14:07:12Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513941,"name":"Phan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phan, 28, is a married woman with two dependent children.

of her family.  She is 31 years old and is married with two children.  Her husband is not in a position to support the family and for that reason, Hurmat is the main breadwinner of the family.  For more than four years, she has been involved in the purchase and sale of industrial products.  She works in the local market, but lately she has fewer clients and she wants to increase her business.  \r\n\r\nHurmat has been looking for a new business for a few months and thankfully she read an advertisement about the \"Get Ahead\" course offered by the Association of Businesswomen.  She enrolled in the course and received a certificate and now she wants to start a business buying and selling bread.  She will sell bread near her home, as the demand for bread is always high.  With the income from this business, she plans to provide her children with a good education and high-calorie foods.  She is asking for a loan of 7,000 somoni to buy bread to start her business.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGloria hopes to have a continuous good health to help her children and grand children and dreams to have a good future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a hardworking woman who really wants to get ahead. She is also kind and cordial. She lives with Elmer, who works as a stevedore. She lives with her father, mother and spouse and their three children, aged 19, 15 and 5. They are her motivation and they live comfortably in their own home that she built on the land her cousin transferred to her. Gloria's activity is selling general groceries from her own house. She opened a small store there where she sells the main basic necessity products such as rice, sugar, pasta, oatmeal and more. \r\n \r\nStarting more than 3 years ago with her spouse's help, whose idea it was, and with her own capital from savings plus a small loan, she was able to buy the first products in small quantities. She was able to grow little by little with a constant rotation of her merchandise.  \r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because of the earnings it brings her and because it is the best stocked store in the area. She likes her business because it allows her to be at home and care for her younger children, whom she loves very much. She also likes her business because of the income it brings in to support her spouse with the household expenses, because many times they didn't have enough to cover their expenses. \r\n \r\nShe plans to continue, expanding the diversity of her products so she will be more preferred by her customers.
