She is a 47-year-old married mother of four children, standing on the left in the picture. In her daily life, she works as an employee in a printing house. Her husband owns a small gypsum manufacturing business. Her children are enrolled in private high schools, which means that she has to cover the tuition fees on top of her other expenses. The Al Majmoua loan would be truly beneficial, because it would help her develop her own business, especially through buying newly released accessories. Rouhaifa is a 46-year-old married mother of three children, standing at the right of the picture. She is Noura's colleague in the printing house. Her husband works in construction as a painter. Her three children are enrolled in private high schools. The exhibition would help her a lot in raising the family\u2019s income, thus covering the tuition expenses. Itidal is a 38-year-old married mother of two children, standing in the center of the picture. She is employed in a shop that arranges flowers for weddings.

She is in the Kichwamba Tweyambe Group that took a total loan amount of 3,800,000 shillings.\r\n\r\nShe is married with four children, all of them at school. Her husband was working with government but ran mad and left all the children and wife helpless; this forced her to start a small-scale business of trading in coffee and produce with the purpose of helping the children and the other two orphans she takes care of who lost their parents.\r\n \r\nShe works daily for eight hours. She also does farming apart from the business she started in 2004. She serves the rural population around her home.\r\n\r\nRovina is going to use the loan money for buying beans and coffee for selling.

Her first connection with PT Ruma was six months ago, when she was introduced by a relative to join Ruma. Now, six months later, her average revenue per day can reach USD 130. Now she is focused to expand her mobile phone credit sales. \r\n\r\nWorking capital loans to Ruma agents allow them to process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions. Each Ruma agent has a balance with Ruma that allows him or her to sell mobile phone credit or process bill payments. When the balance is at zero, the agent cannot process any additional sales or bill payments and has to top up their balance by giving Ruma field officers cash in exchange for electronic credit. For operational efficiency, Ruma can collect from agents only as frequently as once a day and cannot collect on the weekend when banks are closed and cash can't be safely deposited there. As a result, agents often have lower sales on the weekend and have unfulfilled potential to make more transactions during weekdays when their balances are empty.\r\n  \r\nThis working capital loan allows credit-worthy borrowers to reach their full sales potential. The loan is structured like a line of credit that the borrower uses and repays as needed during the loan term. At the end of the term, the borrower is responsible for paying back any outstanding balance so that the total amount can be returned to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":345.63,"image":{"id":1376699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Serang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T14:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T14:30:13Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Siva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":345.63,"local_amount":3500000,"processed_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3721781.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.37,"payment_id":439841526,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T15:31:26Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":575772,"name":"Mama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mama is 35 years old and lives in the West Point area, which has the most populated market in Montserrado County.

She takes care of her family, manages the household chores and also raises pigs besides engaging  with the banana plantation. She uses the Jeep for her business purposes. The Jeep is usually used as a public transport and also used by Ngahhoi to transport her banana produce into the main city to sell. Her sources of income are unreliable as it depends on the season and the market value. \r\n\r\nShe aspires to start a pineapple farm. She says the vast fields of the village are red soils and they are left untouched. Red soil on slopes is the best for pineapple, therefore she wants to buy pineapple saplings and start the plantation. She wants to start an export business for pineapple as the market value in other states of the country is double the rate in Imphal.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Ngahhoi will purchase 200 pineapple saplings and start the plantation.\r\n\r\nShe also dreams of owning a paddy field of her own in the future. She and her husband do farming at rented paddy fields. Thus, she also plans to do some savings and buy a paddy field for the family. \r\n\r\nShe thanks WSDS and Kiva for the unconditional support and co-operation.

She felt blessed for her opportunity, but wanted a way to help her family further.  As a single mother of two daughters, Maria also wanted to have time for her daughters to teach them the work ethic and values imparted to her. \n \nMaria used her business sense and skills to develop a business model that would address all of her family needs and help her achieve her personal goals.  Her motto has been, \u201cYou can always do more.  You can make money doing the right thing.\u201d  Following her motto, she started her own business, Mayan Commercial and Residential Cleaning Services, in June 2012. \n \nSince then, Maria has been able to employ her family members, spend more time with her daughters and expand her business to cover three large commercial locations, servicing over 35,000 ft of retail space.  Maria shares that she enjoys the challenge, and that her deep commitment to integrity and her ambition to provide a better life for her family is what motivates her to succeed.  \n\nMaria\u2019s Kiva loan will be used to purchase a commercial carpet cleaning machine, which will enable her business to service large, retail flooring locations and provide an additional service to her growing clientele.

Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day.\r\n\r\nSumitra has been running a general store in her small village for last 12 years. Her nephew supplements in her business. She sells general grocery items like oil, sugar, lentils, biscuits, soft drinks (sodas) and stationery such as books, pens, etc. Sumitra was able to increase the variety of items at her general store with her scanty savings and increase her cash flow. \r\n\r\nHer monthly income from the existing business is 6000 Indian Rupees (INR). Out of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses and spent some income for construction of a small shop cabin. As per the statement she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase stock of her business. So the loan amount will be utilized to purchase items like lentils, oil, dal, soap, biscuits, potatoes etc. in bulk for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock less frequently. Sumitra hopes to save enough for building a good house for her family as the present house is very small and congested.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Pramila, Jamuna and Kumari who are running a tyre repairing center, a general shop and a goat business respectively.

She's married, has two children, and makes a living by selling women's clothing on the local market. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing school, Gulnora attended a local college studying to become a teacher. Upon graduation, she started working in a local kindergarten. During that time, her children were small, and Gulnora's income was sufficient to support them. However, her children have grown now and, therefore, so have the expenses. Gulnora decided to supplement her income by becoming a saleswoman and selling women's clothing on the market. She gradually learned the nuances of the trade and then started importing the products herself. \r\n\r\nGulnora has worked with Arvand since 2010. Thanks to the latter's assistance, she was able to open and later expand her own salespoint. Currently, Gulnora is planning to purchase an assortment of products and has turned to Arvand for help.

All of her sons are very hardworking and help their father in his business a lot.\r\n\r\nUzma  has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband in his business. Her husband would purchase a wood cutting machine and some wood material for his shop. As they have no other source of income, her husband will be able to continue his business with the help of this loan, and with the net profit he will open a new shop for his son. Uzma dreams for her children's bright future and prays for her husband's good health.

She will thus be able to improve her income and have a wider selection of products on hand to offer her customers and she will be able to continue striving to reach her greatest dream: to provide her child with a profession and in future to have a space of her own for her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":382.55,"image":{"id":1379462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":140.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":143.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":149.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":157.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":161.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":169.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":174.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":181.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":190.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":203.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.36,"local_amount":274.11,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":277.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776345,"comment":null},{"amount":52.18,"local_amount":143.92,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":145.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779347,"comment":null},{"amount":54.2,"local_amount":149.52,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":151.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054540,"comment":null},{"amount":56.97,"local_amount":157.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":159.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819443,"comment":null},{"amount":58.52,"local_amount":161.45,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":163.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472391,"comment":null},{"amount":61.32,"local_amount":169.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":171.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694873,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T19:46:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":576031,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julieta is 50 years old and married with six children.

In this way he will be able to continue working with more tranquility because his family will be safer and he can continue striving to make his greatest dream reality: to own a house.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1379502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to build a fence.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":117.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125.23},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":126.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":131.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":139.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":141.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":150.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":153.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":159.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":172.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":172.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":180.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":185.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":194.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":208.39},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":217.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":224.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577323,"name":"Benita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Benita tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la ciudad de Ica, ciudad que se caracteriza por tener un clima c\u00e1lido y acogedor, asimismo se desarrolla la agricultura, en especial el cultivo de uva, algod\u00f3n, entre otros.

","en":"Daler is a cheerful young man aged 25. He is married and already has three children despite his age. Daler and his family live with his parents in a small village. He has to work hard to provide for his family and for his parents, as he is their eldest son. He earns a steady income working as a craftsman in a local workshop. Daler's wife also helps earn money for the family by cleaning part-time at a local school. Her salary is quite small but provides additional income for the family.

Kadiatu, she is in her late forties and from Tombo Western rural area in Freetown. She is married and has 3 children. Her children are currently attending school. In 2010, Kadiatu established her fish business. She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is that sometimes fish are scarce in the wharf.  \r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to buy more fish for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business.  In the future, Kadiatu plans to own a big shop.

He is married and has three children.  He lives with his family in his parents' home in a little village.  His parents help him and his wife raise their children.  Because Sirojiddin and his wife work more often than not, Sirojiddin's parents spent the most time with the children.  Living in a little village, it's impossible to find good paying work so it is necessary to run your own business to provide an income.  For 10 years, Sirrojiddin has worked with livestock.  Since his early years, he has helped his father in this same business.  From raising and selling cattle, Sirojiddin earns a good income.  He also has a stall at a market where he exchanges currency.  This business brings in additional money.  His wife also earns a living.  She works as an in-home nurse, having earned her degree in the field.  Neighbors hire her to care for their sick and to give injections and she receives money for these services.  Sirojiddin's children are growing and so are their needs.  He wants his children to study at a good school in a city.  Therefore, he plans to expand his livestock business in order to earn more profits and take care of his children's needs.  He needs to buy more cows and to do so, he has turned to Arvand for a loan.  He is grateful for the support.

from Sierra Leone! This is Ramatu a women in her early forties from Tombo Western rural area in Freetown. She is married to a fisherman and is blessed with 3 children between the ages 7 and 20. Two of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nRamatu runs a cookery business at home, and sells local cooking at her house. She has been running this business since 2008. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 6 days per week. Ramatu says that the main challenge to her business is that if sometimes the food is not sold it will spoil.\r\n\r\nRamatu has requested a loan in order to buy food ingredients to expand her cookery business. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and renovate her house. In the future, she plans to educate her children up to college level . She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1377376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

However due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore Alies, as a member of this four-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing his rickshaw.

Rugiatu started her business in 2008 because the income earned by her husband, a fisherman, was not enough to support the family. She tells us that the main obstacle to her enterprise is lack of capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nRugiatu has requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone in order to purchase more items such as alcohol, milk, cigarettes, and biscuits to offer for sale. She says that the extra income from this loan will help her increase her business and allow her to pay her children's school fees. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to buy a plot of land.

She started her business in order to help support her children and to raise the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nMariatu works at her business seven days per week and 15 hours per day. She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation problems and price inflation.\r\n\r\nMariatu is requesting a loan in order to buy more soft drinks, soap, milk, toothpaste, and sardines to offer for sale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to take good care of her family and she prays that she will deliver her baby safely. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mariatu plans to build a

It is a group composed of four women members of the village called Gadramunda. It is located in the Nuapada district of Odisha, India. \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Bhanubai, who has raised her hand in the photo on the extreme right. She is 34 years old. She lives with her husband, one son of seventeen years and two daughters of eleven and nine. \r\n\r\nBhanubai has been running a small bakery factory in her house with the help of her husband for the last ten years. In the bakery factory, items like bread, cream roll, toast, etc. are being prepared. She has engaged three skilled laborers for the processing and making of bakery items. Thirty vendors from fifteen nearby villages come to her factory for taking the product. \r\n\r\nBhanubai says that owing to better quality, design, packing and forms of her products, there is a lot of demand from the locality, but due to shortage of stock, she is not able to meet the demands. She now wants to buy more stock of oil, dough, sugar, etc. with the present loan to increase her production level to meet the demand and grab her customers. \r\n\r\nFrom the increased income, Bhanubai dreams to start an ice cream factory for the next summer season.

","en":"Mirshakar is a young man, age 23.  He's not yet married, but plans to wed soon and is searching for a fiance.  Mirshakar lives with his parents in a rural village.  He helps his parents in every way, he loves them very much, respects them, and cares about their health.  After finishing school, Mirshakar began helping neighboring shepherds, assisting while the cattle grazed in pastures.  Now, it's been three years since Mirshakar started his own livestock business.  He fattens and sells cattle and receives good profits from it.  His parents help him with the business--his father buys and cells the animals, and his mother cares for them.  Mirshakar also works as a secretary at a high school to earn additional income.  Each month, he has to spend large amounts of money on medication for his parents to keep them in good health.

","en":"Zuhro is a positive and cheerful woman, age 30.  She is married and has three children.  After finishing high school, she did not continue her education since her parents immediately married her off.  Since that time, she has worked in the home, caring for her husband and children.  However, to provide an income for her family, both she and her husband run a small business.  Zuhro works at a market and sells food goods.  She is consistently developing her business and now has her own stall to sell from as well as space to expand her inventory.  Her husband works as a farmer.  Together, they bring home a good income which is enough to provide for the family.  However, Zuhro and her husband dream of building their own home where they will live with their children and their children's families.  Now, they live in a small little home that doesn't provide very favorable conditions.  Therefore, Zuhro has begun purchasing building materials for their home.  Now, she wants to take out a loan through Arvand to buy more construction materials.  She relies on the support which will allow her to improve the quality of life for her family.

She is a widow with three children. She is an older woman who works hard every day to get ahead and reach her life goals. She grew up with her parents, who taught her to work in agriculture and on the coffee farms in the area. Her parents owned a small store where she learned the business. Encarnaci\u00f3n got married at the age of 18 and had three children who are now grown. Her husband died 28 years ago, and her children emigrated to the United States. She now lives with her five grandchildren in her home. She used to work selling vegetables in the city market. She would have to walk 45 minutes from the mountains where she lives, and then take the bus to the city. She now has a small store in her community which provides an income for her family.\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the city. To get there, she has to walk. It often takes 45 minutes to get to the village where she catches the bus for the city. She then brings her products back to her community to sell them. She sells basic staples such as beans, corn, rice, and oil. She also sells medicine and other household products.\r\nThis loan, which she is requesting from Fundacion Campo, is for the purchase of bricks, cement, and sand, and to pay labourers to install a floor in her home.

She has built her home through great hard work, and now she needs bricks so that she and her grandchildren can live a better life. They currently run the risk of getting infections in their feet from the humidity.\r\nShe plans to buy a larger display case to display her products, and to help her grandchildren with their studies.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":356.23,"image":{"id":1380010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy bricks, cement, and sand, and to pay labourers to install a floor in her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Encarnaci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":351.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":397.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":450.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":351.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":397.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":356.23,"local_amount":356.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":356.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716121,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-24T08:14:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":576165,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty works hard to support her family.

Jamila, as a member of this two-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan with the goal of helping her husband. He will use the loan amount to purchase plastic for manufacturing plastic bottles to sell. With the profits expected from this loan, he intends to invest in household needs. Jamila hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business. She is thankful to Kiva lenders and to BRAC

This slowly increased his merchandise stock, his working capital, sales liquidity, and the subtleties of the business.\r\n\r\nHis biggest dream is to have his own home and increase his small business. With the last loan, he improved his liquid working capital and family income. He is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n and wants to keep receiving financial aid so he can keep progressing in his business and family life. This is his first Kiva loan, which he will invest in the same products as with the first loan: belts, glasses, wallets, and glasses cases among other items.

In Nepal, large supermarkets are rare. Instead, most items can be found in the small, densely packed pasals that line the streets of every city and village. Piled high with utensils, paper goods, and anything else one would need, these stores are your one-stop shop in Nepal. Although usually packed into a space no larger than 100 square feet, these stores carry a sizeable and diverse inventory.

However, due to constraints, they are not familiar with the best way to raise pigs. To increase their knowledge in animal husbandry, the women agreed to form a group that will be able to exchange information about how to raise pigs in a good and right way. They will also get funding to improve their business.\r\n\r\nNi Luh Gede is a 38-year-old housewife, and is the leader of the Sari Rasa group.

He has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, David will start trading with fruits and vegetables.

One day, there was an improvement project for one of the streets in her neighbourhood and people came to her to buy tortillas to eat. This is how she started her own business five years ago already. It provides her with an income. She now sells to people in the community, and it is a profitable business.

The other child works in the afternoons after school at a mechanic's workshop.\r\nBuying the corn and lime in the city takes her about 15 minutes on public transportation. She travels to the city every week to buy supplies so that she can keep selling tortillas in her community. A neighbour goes with her and helps her to make and sell the tortillas.\r\nThis loan, which she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, is for the purchase of basic materials (corn, lime, and firewood) for the production of tortillas. Her business is profitable and she wants to take advantage of the fact that the price of corn is reasonable at the moment.\r\nWith this loan, she will secure her tortilla production for more time.

From the harvested grapes, Mirian is making wine, and on the plot of land, vegetables are grown. Mirian is a very hardworking man. He is working very hard to earn a small monthly income by selling all the products at the local markets. \r\n\r\nMirian requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Mirian has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Mirian, will purchase seats for his mini-bus. He wants to start driving it on a bus line from his village to the Batumi direction. Mirian will work as hard as he can to earn a good income and use it for his family to provide all the needed household goods and cover their monthly expenses. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":345.46,"image":{"id":1377969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase seats for his mini-bus.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Vaio","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T13:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T13:20:06Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":96.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":102.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":105.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":111.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":111.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":114.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":117.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":127.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":134.02},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":137.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.39,"local_amount":88.8,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":89.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613794,"comment":null},{"amount":54.79,"local_amount":89.46,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":90.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857507,"comment":null},{"amount":56.29,"local_amount":91.89,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":92.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134157,"comment":null},{"amount":58.74,"local_amount":95.9,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":96.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107742,"comment":null},{"amount":59.4,"local_amount":96.99,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":98.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255278,"comment":null},{"amount":61.85,"local_amount":100.98,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":102.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019412,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-28T11:22:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":576391,"name":"Madina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madina is married with two children, and both her children go to school.
