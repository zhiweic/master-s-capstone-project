At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMilagrosa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMilagrosa hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week.

Now she and her group member are requesting a loan of KHR 1,000,000 each. \r\n\r\nAs the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy fertilizer for her cassava business. She hopes to grow her cassava fruitfully and timely so as to sell it for a good price in order to make a better living. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1197998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer for her cassava business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-26T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-26T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokeng ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayeng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2029920,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046656,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T13:23:19Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:49:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":474839,"name":"Eng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eng is a farmer living in a rural area of the Dambae district of Kampong Cham province, Cambodia.

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Aside from this, Avelina also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20000 PHP loan. She will use the loan with her current revolving funds to buy trash from collectors.

In order to be able to pay for her university expenses she worked selling music CDs.  After that she worked as a photography, video, and writing instructor.  Her mother is a housewife.  Her father is retired from the Valle del Cauca government, where he worked as a security guard for 13 years.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica\u2019s dream is to get a Master\u2019s degree in Script Writing and Film Direction.  In order to do that she needs to request Kiva\u2019s support.  This is the only way to cover the expenses of the TOEFL exam and the applications to the universities.\r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nEver since I was a young girl I have been very energetic and curious.  At least that is what my father says when asked about me.  When I graduated from school, I only wanted one thing, to continue studying at the university.  I wanted to attend the Universidad del Valle, the only public university in the city.  That is what I put my mind to doing.  I enrolled in Social Communication.  I dreamed about this university, and it was the only educational opportunity that I had.  My family did not have the financial resources to pay for a private university.\r\n\r\nOne of the happiest days of my life was when my name appeared on the list of those admitted to the university.  From that day on I have not stopped dreaming and striving to make my dreams come true.  \r\n\r\nI now have a new dream.  I wish to study abroad.  I am interested in audiovisual productions and social work through art.  I know that studying abroad will strengthen my skills.  I will be able to return to Colombia with stronger tools in order to contribute to the film industry in my country.  Thus, I will be helping to educate audiences and new filmmakers.  I will help make images more democratic through cinema-based social work.  \r\n\r\nThe first step to achieving my dream has been to belong to the \u201cSemillero de Talentos\u201d [\u201cSeedbed\u201d of Talent] of Colfuturo in conjunction with Proim\u00e1genes.  They gave me a scholarship to further my studies in a second language, English.  Now, in this new phase, where I direct all of my efforts to achieve what I have proposed, Kiva\u2019s support is fundamental in order to continue building this dream.\r\n\r\nWhen I return to my country after my Master\u2019s, I want to continue working hard to show the world that there is talent in my country, and they can do things well.\r\n\r\nThat is exactly where my short and long term goals are targeted, to do business to support the strengthening of Colombian films.  My goal is to tell our stories, these rich and diverse stories that are found in every corner of our beautiful country.  From that point, I want to attract visibility to our valuable, necessary, and differing perspectives and to our day-to-day resistances, which are full of hope.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1204080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay the application expenses for a Master's program in Script Writing and Film Direction.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-26T18:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-26T18:20:13Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1480000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":1480000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1485389.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042086,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-26T23:46:14Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":477779,"name":"Nonvignon 2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"NONVIGNON 2 est un groupement de quatorze personnes, dont les membres r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame quartier au B\u00e9nin.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She is married to a farmer.  She has been a maize farmer for 16 years. She will use this Kiva loan to pay for labor costs and fertilizer for maize production. She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase her production. With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo taken was at the previous maize ground, where the borrower will still use for this new season. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She lives in Tipitapa, in Managua municipality.\r\n\r\nShe has been working in the retail area for 12 years. She began this work at the age of 20, when she used to go out to sell with her mother, who encouraged her to start her own business.\r\n\r\nHer husband helped by buying her a freezer, and she began to sell dairy products, juices, cookies and snacks. Little by little she began to increase her clientele, and managed to set up a small general store.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy rice, cooking oil, beans, sugar, milk, eggs, cream, butter, juices, soft drinks and cleaning products, as they are some of the products in highest demand from her customers.\r\n\r\nThis will help her a great deal, as she will be able to stock some of her customers' necessities, besides improving her income.\r\n\r\nOne of the projects she wishes to undertake is to set up a small clothing and variety store. This will allow her to earn other income, so that she can save money and pay for her children's education.

They said that the group is called that because the majority of the members are artisans who work with clay, so they named themselves that so that they would be easily identifiable. Petra is a very hard working woman with a strong hope to get ahead. She told us that she earns a living selling seasonal fruit and vegetables in the market in an area close to where she lives. She has a garden that produces avocados, peaches and loquats. She said that the loan that is currently pending through VisionFund is to buy flour, sugar, milk, eggs, butter, yeast, and fire wood for her wood burning oven to make the bread, because she also makes money selling bread by going house to house and to people who place orders. A part of the loan will also be used to buy fertilizer for her trees.   \r\n\r\nShe said the loan will be beneficial to her because it will allow her to have raw materials to make her bread and to improve the conditions of her trees. With the profits she makes she will be able to give her family a better quality of life. Her goal is to increase the size of her garden, to depend less on the profits from her bread since baking is very time intensive, and that way she would be able to spend more time with her family.  \r\n\r\nThe other six group members are  Eusebia, Imelda, Elia, Elia Mart\u00ednez, Claudia y Quirino.

In addition to managing her own business and taking care of her home, she has worked as a cook at the Environmental School in Horquetas, Costa Rica since 2010.\r\n\r\nShe started her business three years ago in order to build her savings and support her children in their studies.  Currently she lives with her children and her husband. She started with the salary she was making as a cook at the school in Horquetas.    Her previous loan helped her to develop and strengthen her business, which has been growing ever since. She repaid this loan punctually.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking this second loan so that she can diversify the products that she offers to her customers. This will enable her to meet her customer demand for new products, which will in turn help her to increase her income.  She has placed an important order for dress shoes and sports shoes for men and women.  She needs to pay the bill within 22 days in order to maintain her credit.\r\n\r\nShe also sells clothing and household products through catalogs.  She divides her time in the mornings between getting her children ready for school and working in the school dining hall.  In the afternoons, upon returning home, she sells products and collects payments from customers.  On the weekends, she travels to San Jos\u00e9, where she buys merchandise.\r\n\r\nHer business has a growing base of customers -- to date she has approximately 50 regular clients.  She sells her products at the school and in her community to neighbors and relatives.  She intends to introduce the sale of shoes, but this requires capital; thus she is seeking this loan.  She has customers that will buy these shoes, but her supplier has not given her credit on a long-term basis.

Cate is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. For the past two years, Cate has been working hard to manage her food stall, which sells fresh food like matooke. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Cate has requested a loan of 350,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy  more fresh food like matooke and maize for resale.   It will help Cate to generate greater profits and improve her business by adding more types of fresh food like cassava. Cate hopes that in the future she will be able to improve her family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nCate is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1199280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to

Above all, the group is always very respectful.  It is comprised of six very hard-working women, who, in addition to their household chores, are entrepreneurs.  Each one of them has a productive business activity.\r\n\r\nThat is why they are requesting a loan from the institution.  For example, Paulina, Elvira, Gloria, and Romualda buy sheep to raise and fatten.  They are later able to sell them.  Mar\u00eda will invest in dairy products to stock her grocery store.\r\n\r\nThe group members do not know why its name was chosen.  The people who started the group are no longer working with the institution.  Nevertheless, they believe that it is because the place where they live has many small springs.  These are very helpful to the inhabitants when their community does not have potable water.\r\n\r\nElvira is a member of the Manantial group.  She tells us that she is 33 years old, and she has been married to Melquiades for 15 years.  Together they have formed a family with six children, three of whom go to the community school.  Elvira explains, \u201cI have always lived in the community.  Ever since I was little I have seen all of the community\u2019s customs like the dishes that are eaten, the holidays that are celebrated, the typical clothing, what is grown, and what is raised.  Also, through the years I have seen how all of this is being forgotten.  What I have learned from my community is raising animals like the sheep that I have at home.  I have three sheep, but I am thinking of buying five more and fodder.  I started this business activity individually five years ago.  The person who helped me a lot to be successful in my business activity was my mother-in-law.  She taught me important tips in order to be successful.  The only difficulty I encountered is the lack of information about how to take better care of my sheep.  Many times they get sick and die.  I would like to get training in order to know about this issue.\r\n\r\nThis time I will use the loan to buy wood to improve and enlarge the sheep corral.  I only have three, and if I buy five more sheep, they will not fit.  All of them together will be very uncomfortable.  I bought my sheep when they were little in order for them to grow and fatten so that I could later sell them for a better price.  When they are bigger and fatter, the pay is better.  In order to achieve all of this, in the mornings I clean the corral where they sleep.  After that I give them dried grass to eat, and I provide them with water. \r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, after my children get home from school, I feed them.  Then we all go to the plains for my sheep to graze.  This is what I like the best because my children play soccer there, and they have a lot of fun.  This way I take care of my sheep and my children.\u201d  When we asked her what her goal is, she smiled and said, \u201cFixing my house because I don\u2019t want it to leak like a sieve.  When it rains it gets very wet, I do not know how to control the leaking.  My goal for my children is for them to complete their studies, and earn a professional degree.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4425,"image":{"id":1202982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy wood to improve and enlarge the sheep corral.

experiencia, inicie mi negocio porque ten\u00eda que obtener otra entrada de dinero aunque trabajo como obrero muchas veces la familia necesita otras cosas y es por eso que me decid\u00ed criar animales ya que es una actividad muy buena que se puede desarrollar muy bien en la comunidad, pero tambi\u00e9n inicie porque ten\u00eda un amigo que me invito a criar animales y me motivo mucho porque desde al principio me ofreci\u00f3 una tanda de cerdos que tenia para m\u00ed y se  acepte y as\u00ed fue como empec\u00e9 a criar animales, es por eso que estoy solicitando un nuevo cr\u00e9dito con la instituci\u00f3n para comprar alimento para cerdos para engordar a sus cerdos, es una dificultad por la cual estoy atravesando la falta de dinero para comprar m\u00e1s alimento pero gracias al cr\u00e9dito el podre comprar el alimento, hace tiempo yo llegue  a tener  cerdas grandes que pod\u00edan darme hasta 25 lechones (cerdos chicos)  me iba muy bien sin embargo un buen d\u00eda me invitaron para hacerme cargo del puesto de delegado el cual acepte pero absorb\u00eda mucho mi tiempo y fue cuando empec\u00e9 a tener problemas con mis animales, dos cerdas que estaban a punto de parir perdieron todos sus lechones por salta de atenci\u00f3n, llegue a perder 50 lechones en un mismo d\u00eda, si mis cerdos que tengo en casa y mis reces crecen en muy poco tiempo podre vender mis cerdos a muy buen precio con atenci\u00f3n y que est\u00e9n muy bien alimentados en cuatro meses podre recuperarme en la misma cantidad, quiero que mis animales crezcan y siga yo teniendo

Construction started to happen on top of the tracks and now just parts of them are still visible.\r\n\r\nFelipe is the group representative and he relates that he\u2019s 54-years-old and only studied up to fourth grade in elementary school.  He married Mar\u00eda and they formed a family and had children.  Currently, though, they only have one son left at home who is attending school and a granddaughter who is also in their care.  Felipe relates that he has worked raising animals and at the moment has only seven pigs and two heads of cattle.  He has 17 years\u2019 experience in this activity.  He started it because he had to find another source of income because even though he worked as a laborer often his family needed other things and that\u2019s why he decided to start raising animals which is a very good activity that can be developed well in his community.  But he also got into it because a friend invited him to raise some animals and that motivated him very much because at the very beginning he gave him a litter of pigs that he\u2019d set aside for him and he accepted it and that\u2019s how he started to raise animals.  \r\n\r\nThis is why he\u2019s asking for a loan from the institution in order to buy feed for the pigs to fatten them up.  The lack of cash to buy more feed is a difficulty he\u2019s going through at present but thanks to the loan he will be able to buy the feed.  Some time ago he reached the point of having large sows that produced up to 25 piglets.  He did very well and one day he was asked to accept the position of delegate and he accepted but it absorbed too much of his time and he started to have problems with his animals.  Two of the sows that were about to give birth lost their entire litters because of lack of care.  He lost 50 piglets in a single day.  If the pigs and cattle he has at home now grow well in a short period of time he will be able to sell the pigs at a good price.  With good care and being fed well he\u2019ll be able to recuperate and reach the same number in four months.   He wants his animals to grow and he wants to have much more so that his children can continue going to school because he wants them to have careers where they can develop professionally.  Felipe is a very hardworking, responsible man.  All he wants is a better quality of life for his family.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda and Celia are part of the group; they also raise animals and will also invest in Felipe\u2019s animals because this is a shared activity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1203001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pig feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Nicolas Guadalupe, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-26T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-26T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":265},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":273.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":265},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":273.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":273.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4648.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.66,"local_amount":538.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":551.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120019,"comment":null},{"amount":195.01,"local_amount":2463.34,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2519.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284808,"comment":null},{"amount":9.82,"local_amount":124.04,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":126.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595947,"comment":null},{"amount":227.51,"local_amount":2873.79,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-30T09:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2938.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663575,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T18:33:10Z","paid_date":"2013-05-30T09:10:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":476954,"name":"Sara Lizette","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sara, de oficio comerciante, habita en la ciudad de Managua , de profesi\u00f3n contadora , pero debido a la escasez de trabajo , se dedica a atender un negocio de pulper\u00eda y fotocopiadora.

They decided on that particular business because her husband had already worked as a day laborer caring for nurseries and they decided to have one of their own.\r\n\r\nShe relates that the first year they only planted a few plants because they had no one to sell the plants to but gradually as the years have gone by they\u2019ve acquired customers; this is their sixth consecutive year of planting and selling this beautiful December plant.  She says that they are now planting different varieties like Suljibri, Freedom, Pink Marble, Marbell, Star, White and Sonora.  The flowers are already attaining their color and in the month of November they will be ready to be sold at wholesale to her customers.  \r\n\r\nRight now she\u2019s asking for a loan to buy manure, insecticide and paper to wrap them for sale.

is from the village of Tskaltubo district. She is 51 years old and lives with her husband, son and daughter-in-law. The family runs the agricultural business. They have a greenhouse where cucumbers, tomatoes and different kinds of greens are grown. Chito also sows vegetables in open ground and does all relevant seasonal work to ensure a good harvest. The harvested products are sold in different parts of the district, using the family-owned car. In addition, the family sells the part of the harvest at the local open market. Chito works hard to make some savings and improve the living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan to purchase organic fertilizers for her greenhouse.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Octavia is very hard-working and she says: \"there is nothing difficult in life, as long as you have good health and a good attitude.\" Octavia knows the challenges of working in the fields, particularly for a woman.  For that reason her husband and her children help her with her work.  She began working in the fields 35 years ago.  From very early in the morning she would go out to her field regardless of rain because she had to maintain her plants and keep them from disease.  For this reason she is asking MFP for a loan in order to help with her work plans.  With time she wants to increase her coffee plants because she knows sales are good and in that way she can obtain a stable income.  This is her 6th credit with MFP, and she therefore promises to continue meeting her payments.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Sixteen years ago she started working in the cultivation of coffee plants, which she obtained with a lot of hard work. During the harvest she usually requires the help of day-workers so that they can easily pick the fruits. For Marina, the most difficult thing is when she is unable to fight the plagues which affect her coffee production. For this reason she found out about MFP loans, and she did not hesitate in approaching a consultant. Now, thanks to the support she can carry out her planned work. This is her third credit, and she promises to make her repayments punctually. She supports her communal bank for its good organization.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He is married to a farmer. He has been a maize farmer for eight years. He will use Kiva loan to pay labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production: He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo taken was at the previous maize ground, which the borrower will still use for this new season. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

","en":"Darwin is a young man of 21 who had the opportunity to get through elementary school and lives with his father, Segundo, who is a  57-year-old brick mason. They live in the Boliche neighborhood of the city of Latacunga, capital of the Cotopaxi province, which is part of the Andes region of Ecuador. Cotopaxi has developed to such a remarkable extent in recent years that it has become known as one of the most important provinces of the whole region thanks to its floral, mining, metalworking, agricultural, and cattle industries. What's more, there are many businesses investing their growing profits back into this commercial city and offering many opportunities to get ahead. Latacunga is a charming city that attracts tourists with its narrow colonial streets and architecturally interesting churches that preserve their facades of years past. \r\n\r\nDarwin makes cement blocks that are used as bricks for constructing houses. He learned this trade very young, led by his older brothers. Now, Darwin has been in this trade for 3 years, spending 8 hours every day without help. This line of business is very active in the city and the province generally, so the competition is increasingly strong. Nonetheless, Darwin has decided to increase his capacity so he can earn a higher income. That's how he came to learn about financial institutions that help young entrepreneurs and requested a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa [Kiva field partner], which, in addition to providing financial support, also offers advice on how to improve his business. Darwin hopes that his business will come to be known as one of the big cinderblock suppliers so he can realize his dream of having his own home. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1203909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy supplies to increase the capacity of his business.

El y su familia, conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 4 hijos en las edades de 13 a 25 a\u00f1os, vive al suroccidente de la ciudad, en un barrio que poco a poco sale de la informalidad de sus habitantes, quienes son principalmente trabajadores independientes, con grandes sue\u00f1os de salir adelante, mediante la educaci\u00f3n de su familia.  En la actualidad necesita surtir su negocio porque la demanda de los art\u00edculos que ofrece crece cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s y sus inventarios no resisten tanta solicitud, por su insuficiente capital de trabajo para responderles y hacer que su negocio crezca. Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual se acerca a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para solicitar un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a esta organizaci\u00f3n, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 v\u00edveres, bebidas y c\u00e1rnicos, para obtener descuentos y aumentar sus ingresos. En su negocio Benjam\u00edn realiza las ventas de contado y se desempe\u00f1a en su labor comercial, de lunes a domingos, con pocos descansos; las compras las realiza a cr\u00e9dito y de contado a distribuidores de sus productos, que le hacen buenas ofertas y le ofrecen oportunidades de acceso a art\u00edculos, con descuentos y a cr\u00e9ditos. Su meta mas adelante es hacer reparaciones locativas a su negocio, porque \u00e9l esta esmerado en hacerle a sus clientes un ambiente confortable, cuando le van a comprar  y finalmente tener una casa propia,  lo cual es muy seguramente uno de sus grandes desaf\u00edos.   ","en":"Benjamin, 52, owns a store where he sells snack food, supplies, soft drinks, and general household items in small amounts that his customers can afford. He and his family, made up of his partner and their 4 children, ages 13 to 25, live in the southwest of the city in a neighborhood that is slowly but surely emerging from the informal economy of its residents, who are mostly independent workers with big dreams of getting ahead through their families' education. \r\n\r\nCurrently, he needs to stock up his store because what he offers is in more and more demand every day and his inventory can't keep up with that pace due to a lack of the working capital he needs to make his business grow. That's exactly the reason that he's gotten involved with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [Kiva field partner] to request a Kiva loan, his first from this organization, with which he will buy home supplies, beverages, and meats in bulk so as to receive discounts and increase his earnings. \r\n\r\nAt work, Benjamin is busy manning the cash register and attending to his business from Monday to Sunday with few breaks. He makes his purchases on credit and in cash from suppliers that can offer him deals and opportunities to buy items at a discount. His most pressing goals are to make certain repairs to his business, as he's focussed on providing a comfortable environment for his customers when they come in to shop and, ultimately, to have his own home, which is definitely one of his main struggles.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1204009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy home supplies, beverages, and meats for sale.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is impacted by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

All of the members are from the city of Concepci\u00f3n, Chile. M\u00f3nica, a group member who is seated in the photo fourth from the right in the front row with a lilac jumpsuit, has made a living selling assorted salads for the past 12 years. She says she works Wednesdays and Saturdays, selling in the streets and other times at flea markets, her schedule depending on availability. She buys her merchandise and supplies at the commercial center where farmers bring in their products, where she finds fresh vegetables at low costs, which is financially beneficial. With the loan, she plans to purchase olives, cabbage, lettuce and carrots to stock her business. One of M\u00f3nica's goals is for her business to grow and to have a store where she can offer her products so she can generate more income and thus improve her quality of life. M\u00f3nica lives with her husband and their three children, two of whom are in school and the oldest of whom is working. Her dream for work is having her own store, and her familial dream is to have her own home since they live on her mother's land. She is very content and grateful for the opportunity provided by Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza, which has allowed her to invest in her business. Furthermore, she feels comfortable with the fellow members of her community bank, because the different activities and interests serve as a welcomed distraction. In respect to the training she has received at the group meetings, she has learned to better administer her business. Concepci\u00f3n is seated at the mouth of the Biob\u00edo River, one of the largest in the country, in southern Chile in the region of Biob\u00edo. It has played an important role in the nation's history, being sight of important battles and treaties, especially during the Arauco War (a long-running conflict between colonial Spaniards and the Mapuche people). Currently the city is undergoing an important economic and demographic development to come to be considered one of the most relevant urban, demographic, administrative, financial and commercial centers in Chile, after Santiago and

Her business began 6 years ago, and it is a sales point or variety store where she sells many retail items, such as feminine accessories, items for the home, perfume, and paper goods, among other items. She makes her sales on credit or for cash, while she makes her purchases in warehouses and china shops which sell to her in larger quantities and where she is able to obtain discounts when she buys a larger volume. Her principal clients are the neighbors in the district where she is located, who satisfy their shopping needs in Eilsa's business without having to travel to the commercial centers, incurring expenses. Her goal for the future is to expand her retail structure and have the opportunity to provide her children, who are the reason for her dedicated and persistent work, with their own home.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

is 51 years old.

He will use Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production: He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She established her own business 2 years ago, where she sells consumer staples such as: meat, dairy products, sausages, drinks, rice, beans, cleaning products, etc.  She previously worked in a maquila (manufacturing plant), but since her earnings were low she decided to establish her own business, which already has a good customer base and earns her more income.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The challenges she is facing are price fluctuations and inflation, the costs of purchasing stock and the seasonal nature of her business. She is applying for a loan of 41,900 Kenyan shillings (KES) to buy more vegetables wholesale. The extra income she generates from the loan will be added to her savings to expand the business.

Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por lo que sus habitantes aprovechan la oportunidad para ofrecer tours, servicio de hospedaje, alimentaci\u00f3n, deportes naturales como cabalgatas, etc. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas.

The family lives together in a rural parish, in the city of Quito, the capital of Ecuador.  The parish is called Gualea and it is in the north-west of Pinchincha province which was home to an Ecuadoran culture known as Los Yumbos.  This area boasts a diversity of flora and fauna, as well as rivers and waterfalls which are crystal clear and attract both domestic and international tourists.  Locals make the most of this opportunity to offer tours, accommodations, food and outdoor sports such as horse riding, etc.  Other common businesses in the area are livestock raising (for meat and milk) and the farming of sugarcane, cassava, maize, oranges, mandarins and papaya.  Hand-made crafts are also a good business opportunity here and the goods are in demand because they use natural materials such as seeds.  As a result of all this, the local authorities have worked to install adequate systems so that all of the 2,000+ inhabitants have access to basic services.\r\n\r\nEdy has the opportunity to develop the livestock-raising business that he learned from his parents and which he has been working in for the last 26 years.  Every day, he gets up very early to milk his cows and goes out to sell their milk to his customers.  He works for eight hours, sometimes more.  Edy sees Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa as offering an opportunity to grow his business because they provide support to the rural community through loans and training.  He requested a loan to buy more cows so that he can increase his production and thereby improve his income and cover all his children's needs because, one day, he would like to see them become top professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1204036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Her wages are not sufficient for her to provide for her 4 young children because her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation. Obida needs new sources of income. To that end, she studied in a course entitled \"To Get Ahead\" that was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate.\r\n\r\nObida wants to set up a business in buying and selling cattle, since she has experience in this field.

muy exitosos.   \nDennys en su experiencia de negocio de hace 32 a\u00f1os, ha logrado apoyar los ingresos de su hogar y sostenerse en el mercado, con mucha creatividad. Su idea emprendedora naci\u00f3, porque su c\u00f3nyuge ten\u00eda un negocio muy grande de comidas y all\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 a elaborar muchos de los productos que hoy vende.  \nDesde el a\u00f1o 1985 decidi\u00f3 emprender un restaurante con la ayuda de tres hermanos, pero solo existi\u00f3 hasta hace un a\u00f1o, cuando se vincul\u00f3 totalmente a la venta de productos por cat\u00e1logos y convirti\u00f3 su restaurante en un negocio de comidas r\u00e1pidas, donde vende salchipapas, perros calientes, s\u00e1ndwich, hamburguesas, entre otras delicias, que combina creativamente para deleitar a su clientela.  Dennys tiene a su vez  un espacio adecuado en su casa, donde vende en  temporada navide\u00f1a, carnes fr\u00edas para la cena de nochebuena en familia y tambi\u00e9n comercializa  productos de tocador.

Her family is made up of her husband and six children, ages 26-40; she dreams of their success.  With 32 years of experience and great creativity, Dennys has managed to help with the household income and support herself in the market.  Her enterprising idea was born because her spouse had a large food business where she learned to make many of the products she sells today.\r\n\r\nIn 1985 she decided to start a restaurant with the help of her three brothers, but it only has existed since a year ago, when she started to sell exclusively catalogue products and converted her restaurant into a fast-food business where she sells \"salchipapas\" [fried potatoes and sausages], hot dogs, sandwiches, hamburgers, and other tasty foods that she combines creatively for the enjoyment of her customers.\r\n\r\nDennys has adapted a space in her house where during the Christmas season she sells cold meat for the Christmas Eve family dinner.  She also sells beauty products.  She makes all her sales directly, so her customers come to her business or she visits them and sells for cash and credit.  She buys her food supplies in delicatessens and her cosmetics from large distributors who give her a catalogue periodically she she'll sell their products.\r\n\r\nHer main customers are employees, factory owners, neighbors, and referrals who know her and make requests every time they need something.  Among her long-term goals is adapting a space for her restaurant to offer her customers a comfortable and air-conditioned ambiance.  She also wants to separate the business from her house so she can have more quiet for herself.\r\n\r\nCurrently she's applying for a Kiva loan to buy merchandise such as perfume, cosmetics, household items, creams, and beauty products.  Dennys projects that her business will improve with this investment because she'll have products available to expand her clientele, because she has bills to collect and sometimes she doesn't recover them.  It's not enough to satisfy her customers' requests, especially for the Day of Love and Friendship [third Saturday in September in Colombia], a big sales period for her.\r\n

As the main breadwinner of the family, in 2002 Burmakan began selling clothes for children and teenagers at the market. She started this business with only 30,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, her turnover is 130,000 Som and the monthly income from her business is about 20,000 Som. These earnings allow Burmakan to pay for her middle daughter's education. \r\n\r\nBurmakan has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som for the purpose of further developing her business. She will use these funds to stock up on children's clothes for school and casual wear for the upcoming season. Burmakan will use the profit generated by this loan to expand her business by opening another sales outlet, and to pay for her daughter's wedding expenses next year.

She sells dishes such as: hot dogs, hamburgers, pizzas and other delicious combinations. She first had the idea for her business when her husband was working at a fast food restaurant, and she was observing the food industry process. Shortly thereafter, she decided to start her own adventure in food sales, and began selling hot dogs from a rented cart. As business began to grow, Susana added a second cart to her operation, and also started selling pizzas. Since she has learned how to prepare and make all her food dishes, she decided to buy an oven to broaden the scope of her operations. Gradually, as her business kept growing, Susana slowly added tables and chairs to the area around her stand so that she could accommodate more customers. Today, her's is a popular, well-known food stand that also delivers to customers' homes. She accepts cash payments for food items, and operates her stand Thursday through Sunday every week. The other days of the week, she goes to Barranquilla to purchase food from delis to stock her food stand for the rest of the week. \r\n\r\nSusana's goal is to grow and strengthen her business, and to continually improve the quality of her food and the products she offers to her customers, most of whom are from nearby neighborhoods and areas. She tries to constantly add new ingredients and be creative with her dishes, and she always makes an effort to treat her customers and suppliers very well. Susana promises to make punctual payments in this, her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She plans to use the support from this loan to purchase food for her stand, including: hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, sausages, french fries, breads, sauces, etc. She hopes that this investment will help her to improve her business and offer a wider variety of products to her customers, leading to increased sales.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1203216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase hot dogs, hamburgers, sausages, pizzas, french fries, bread, sauces and other items for her food stand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":850000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60874},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63617},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65101},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66620},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68175},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":69766},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71394},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73059},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74764},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76509},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78294},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81827}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.02,"local_amount":60874,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":61248.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387535,"comment":null},{"amount":440.98,"local_amount":789126,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":793975.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928213,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-02T17:32:27Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":477501,"name":"Luis Rodrigo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis tiene 26 a\u00f1os, curs\u00f3 la secundaria y vive con su pareja de 24 a\u00f1os con quien tiene un hijo de apenas 2 meses, viven en la casa de los padres de Luis que se encuentra en Latacunga capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador y que los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera.

This is the capital of Cotopaxi province, part of Ecuador's sierra region. \r\n\r\nThe region has developed notably in recent years, so much so that it's now considered among the most important, thanks to its flower-growing, mining, metallurgy, agro-industry, agriculture and cattle-raising. In addition, there are business establishments that generate notable incomes, converting it into a commercial city with various opportunities to get ahead. Latacunga is a welcoming city that attracts tourists with its narrow, decorated, colonial streets and its architectonic churches that conserve the typical facades of past years.\r\n\r\nLuis sees an opportunity to expand his cattle-raising activity, which he was taught by his parents, starting in early childhood some 20 years ago. Each day, he invests 2 or 3 hours in the most demanding activities while his wife is responsible for the general care of the animals. Luis combines milk-producing activity with raising pigs for later sale.\r\n\r\nLuis approached the Fundacion Alternativa hoping to expand, and seeking the help it offers the rural sector with loans and training opportunities. He solicited a loan to buy more animals and increase milk production.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnnalisa hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Jordan has used his strong leadership abilities and entrepreneurial mind-set to address some of these problems in Uganda.\n\nIn an effort to reduce litter and waste materials that collect in \u201cchannels breaking the water system and causing soil degradation,\u201d Jordan constructed a chicken pen made solely from recycled water bottles, which he collected, filled with sand and arranged together like bricks. This has been standing for 6 months. The remaining bottles were used to pack liquid soap for people wanting to buy it in small quantities. Jordan now runs this operations as a small business.\n\nWhen his community was required to retrieve water from a well as a result of a blocked drainage system rendering regular tap water unusable, Jordan took charge of the situation by ensuring that all of the stagnant water was removed. He explained the dangers of drinking stagnant water to the community at large, and helped mobilise the massive crowds of people into queues so that they could collect water in an orderly fashion. \nJordan is also a top student and has been awarded a Certificate of Merit for academic excellence in Uganda. At school in Uganda he was involved in numerous extracurricular activities, including the Wildlife Conservation club, the Science club, and the United Nations club. \n\nJordan sees ignorance as a key contributing factor to the high levels of health-related problems facing the African continent. He wants to become a doctor and help find causes, signs, and preventative measures, thereby freeing up money currently being spent on treatment to be invested in other important areas (e.g. agriculture and education). \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1203223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T18:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T18:00:20Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jordan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748413,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735296,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614229,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T20:44:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":477498,"name":"Teofila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Te\u00f3fila tiene 54 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera, tiene dos hijos, y vive en el municipio de la Masica, Atl\u00e1ntida con un hijo y un nieto.

She is passionate about social entrepreneurship and helping those who are less fortunate. A prime example of this is a project she worked on involving refugees near her home. Noticing that the refugees did not interact with others in the community because they could not speak English, Sharon started a program to address the language barrier.  She located space, recruited two volunteers, and started providing English classes for the refugees and immigrants in order to \u201ccut communication barriers with their neighbors.\u201d\n\nAnother example of Sharon\u2019s innate desire to help others came about in her role as leader of the Apostolic Faith Mission Youth program. When she noticed a young orphan in her community who needed looking after, Sharon took it upon herself to write to the church to ensure that the orphan was taken care of.\n\nSharon\u2019s strong leadership capabilities were recognized when shortly after moving to a new school, she was elected as treasurer and chief organizer of the school\u2019s commerce club. Other leadership roles she occupied in school were debate team captain and president of Academics for her Students\u2019 Representative Council. Academically, she was the best student in her school and held this position for the past two years. \n\nSharon displayed courage and resilience when, despite losing her brother a few days before a math exam and Olympiad, she took the experience as a motivational one to encourage her to strive harder and perform well. From this experience, she has learned that \u201csome situations are meant to be catalysts to make you achieve greater success.\u201d She explains that one should \u201cnever allow any knock down to be a knock out; find strength to get back.\u201d\n\nSharon wants to build an orphanage to shelter vulnerable children who have lost their parents. This is because she believes that \u201cwhen a child has the right kind of support, love, and comfortable home living, it gives him one less thing to worry about so that he can concentrate on his studies and make a difference.\u201d  In the next 20 years, she also hopes to build a \u201cvictory empowerment house to help people who are violated of their rights\u201d and become a motivational speaker to help people discover their inner strength. \n\nShe is passionate about bringing about positive change on the continent and  hopes \"every African has access to education and primary health care, good sanitation, and running water and sleeps with a filled stomach.\u201d\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1203231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sharon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748414,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735297,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614230,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T18:51:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":478001,"name":"Hector Miguel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"HECTOR MIGUEL tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad es soltero tiene 3 hijos, vive con los hijos en la ciudad de Ventanas Provincia de los R\u00edos. \n\nHECTOR MIGUEL se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz.

At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nFrederick operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, he is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nFrederick hopes to give his children a good and quality education and dreams of having an abundant life in the future. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1200042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frederick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2083.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114798,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.99,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3472.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350857,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.04,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2778.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959962,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2083.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094676,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T18:46:29Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":476770,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary, a wife and mother of four in the Mukuru informal settlement of Nairobi, is ready to change her life.

six children - five daughters and one son.  To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for 16 years, having started this business with a sum of 9,000 som.  Thanks to Aigul's hard work, today her business contains three dairy cows with offspring and 13 heads of small livestock.
