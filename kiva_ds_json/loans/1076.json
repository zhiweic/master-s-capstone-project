She lives in a traditional family setting with other couples and their children.  She is a resident of the Hamdallaye neighborhood of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nSira left school at a very young age, and she got involved in small retail alongside her mother who was selling condiments.  After learning from her mother for several years, she now works alone and sells rechargeable phone cards.  She has been involved in this activity for seven years and has many customers.\r\n\r\nEager to meet her customers' demand, she joined Soro Yiriwaso seven years ago.  Having duly repaid 14 solidarity loans, she is now taking her first individual loan which will be used to buy rechargeable phone cards.

Myagmarsuren is 51 years old and lives with her family in Erdenet, the third largest city of Mongolia.

Her husband has been working at the department of urban development for five years. Her son has recently begun working as a driver at a private business entity. She herself has been working as a janitor at a high school for eight years and before this job, she worked for twenty-eight years at a public service organization. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve her family\u2019s living standard, she wants to build a house on her son\u2019s yard.  Compared to a Mongolian traditional ger, the house will be more spacious and better at heat preservation. She is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT to purchase cement, bricks and planks to build a house. As a result, in harsh winter time, the family can live in a more comfortable and warmer place. The most important aspect of building a house is that it enables the family to burn less coal thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution by emitting less smoke. The borrower is very hardworking individual who strives for better future.

Badralmaa is 41 years old and lives with her husband and two children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her son is a fourth year student at a railroad college and her daughter is first year university student. She herself has been working as a machine operator at a printing company for seven consecutive years. For twenty years, her husband has been working in an electric grid servicing company as an electrician. The automobile the family has been using for transportation has been deteriorating over the years and now it is out of service. She is requesting a loan of 3,100,000 MNT to purchase an electric vehicle.  \r\n\r\nEnvironmental advantages of electric vehicles include, and are not limited to: it releases almost no air pollutants at the place where they are operated. In addition, it is generally easier to build pollution-control systems into centralized power stations than retrofit enormous numbers of cars. Electric vehicles typically create less noise pollution than an internal combustion engine vehicle, whether it is at rest or in motion. Electric vehicles emit no tailpipe CO2 or pollutants such as NOx, NMHC, CO and PM at the point of use. In conclusion, based on above mentioned advantages, purchasing of electric vehicle will contribute to the efforts against air pollution, as well as can be used as an income generator for the family by using it for a taxi service. The borrower is one of the trustworthy clients of our organization and used her previous loan for its very purpose and paid each installment debt on the due dates.

Taking advantage of her husband's 20 years of experience, Patricia opened a butcher shop in a family-owned locale through a joint venture with her husband.  They sell meat and disposable products.  The business grew little by little and even though she worked elsewhere, she helped her husband out part-time.  But it got difficult to care for her child so she decided to quit work and dedicate her time exclusively to the business.\r\n\r\nThe experience from her husband and his family was the most important, positive factor in strengthening the business.  Today, their growth expectations are higher than they were before because they are in a good location with a lot of vehicle traffic that will help increase sales.  Their competitors are stores that sell less quantity of the same products at a higher price, so that means their shop has more customers.  This is exactly why she is requesting a CrediKiva loan, her first from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  It will be used to buy beef, poultry, pork and fish in larger quantities in order to supply the increased daily demand.  She also will buy disposable plates, cups and other products at discount prices.  She will offer better prices to the customers and earn a higher income from the sales volume.

She is a hardworking and optimistic woman. She is married to R\u00f3mulo, with whom she has four children, aged 30, 21, 15 and 11. She owns her own home where she lives with her children and husband, with whom she works every day to offer her family a better quality of life. Yolanda's work is selling fish. She goes early to the main port in the city seeking the largest and freshest fish. From there she goes to the highway, because that is where she sets up her booth, since she has customers who wait for her to buy her fish, that she offers at a good price. She has been doing this work for about 10 years and what she doesn't like is that she has to leave her children, a sacrifice she has to make because she has to give them the best and have income for the home. She hopes to be able to consolidate more with her sales and open a store selling fresh and dried fish. This will be her first Kiva loan. She is very grateful for the opportunity that has been offered by the institution to increase her capital. She is committed to making her payments on time. With the amount she has asked for, 1500 soles, she will buy a larger quantity of fish as well as ice and some other materials that she needs to be able to keep doing her job.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1312041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fish.

growing tomatoes and cucumbers on his own land in the village of Vodyanoye.  This has been his profession for 12 years.  He has three plots of land.  The  income from his garden is around 350,000 griven annually.  Dmytryi needs a loan of 24,000 griven to install heating in his greenhouses and to purchase a boiler.  Next year, he wants to use his heated greenhouses to plant vegetables earlier.  Last year an unfortunate mishap landed Dmytryi in the hospital when his sleeve caught in his motorized ground-tiller.  It dragged him along the ground and he hit his head on a pipe and lost consciousness.  He woke up in hospital in Kiev.  Although he had to spend 60,000 griven on his recovery, he's fortunate to not have any permanent damage.  This accident unfortunately happened during the spring, when there was much work to be done in the garden that he was not able to do.  Although his friends helped, the crop was too late and Dmytryi had to sell his car.  This year is much better.  He has purchase another car and continues to work.

She then takes them home to prepare the delicious dishes that characterize her and which have led to her having many customers.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in business for about five years and she works alone.  What she enjoys about her work is that it gives her free time to devote to her home.  She\u2019s also able to do some other activities like renting out a mototaxi to generate improved income.  She hopes in future to improve her site\u2019s infrastructure to continue providing the best for her customers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this will be her first Kiva loan and she\u2019s very grateful for the support provided since it will help her improve her business.  She will use the 1,000 soles to buy ingredients like rice, vegetables and meats, among others to continue with her food sales since she hopes to increase the variety of meals she offers in her food stand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1312089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients like rice and meat, among others..","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-14T17:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-13T17:30:11Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":151.71},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":158.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":164.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":165.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":176.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":182.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.68,"local_amount":151.71,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":157.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869095,"comment":null},{"amount":63.49,"local_amount":158.72,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":164.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577938,"comment":null},{"amount":65.86,"local_amount":164.65,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":170.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530167,"comment":null},{"amount":66.32,"local_amount":165.79,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":171.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975199,"comment":null},{"amount":70.79,"local_amount":176.97,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":183.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996464,"comment":null},{"amount":72.86,"local_amount":182.16,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863946,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-14T19:14:03Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:23:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537145,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie is married and works hard to provide for her family.

It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nKhatuna requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nSince her husband has a rich experience in this field, she decided to start their own bakery. With the received credit, they will buy all the needed equipment to bake Georgian bread. Khatuna thinks that the business will be profitable and they will be able to increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Among the dishes that are found here are \"salchipollo\" (a hot dog and chicken dish), \"salchipapas\" (a hot dog and french fry dish), fried chicken and other snack foods that are common where she lives. She has a hot dog truck which she uses for work.

He started working with other people because he needed a way to make a living and support his family. This is how he decided to travel to the United States to work in home remodeling.

is 64 years old and is from Telavi district, East Georgia.

Her loan request was rejected every time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for her family is the small incomes of her husband and son. Both are working as artisans: they repair cars and receive a small daily income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMaradi requested loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and who are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Maradi will purchase all the needed equipment for the grocery store that she plans to open, in which she will work as a sales lady. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1311529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to open a grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Telavi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-14T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-13T21:50:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maradi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":59.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":57.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":57.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":65.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":71.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.08,"local_amount":59.08,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":59.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570345,"comment":null},{"amount":54.29,"local_amount":54.29,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":54.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968978,"comment":null},{"amount":54.77,"local_amount":54.77,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":54.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749396,"comment":null},{"amount":1031.86,"local_amount":1031.86,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1031.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613303,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-15T18:33:42Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537219,"name":"Lagafuaina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lagafuaina is 38 years old, married, and has six children.

three wonderful girls.  After finishing university with a degree in history, she started a career as a history teacher. However, the main source of the income for her family has been her livestock business which she has run for 7 years.  She started this business with 12,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, today she has 1 calf, 10 sheep and 1 horse.  Nurzada also farms a half hectare of land with her husband where they grow beans.  Each year, the family earns around 150,000 KGS from their crop and reselling livestock.  With the goal of further developing her business, Nurzada has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy one cow from which she will harvest milk to sell, as well as feed for her other animals.  The income from the loan will be put back into the business.  Nurzada plans to build a home for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1053.57,"image":{"id":1311347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase 1 milk cow and fodder for cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Tuu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-14T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-13T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurzada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":421.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":632.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":421.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":421.43,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":20150.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743757,"comment":null},{"amount":632.14,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":30226.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426842,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-15T07:20:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537249,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a married youth client from Iraq.

She is a single mother with two children who depend on her financially, both of whom are studying. Her older child is 18 and is in the second level of secondary school, and her younger child is 14 and is in the second grade of middle school. After they get out of school, they help their mother with the farm labor, such as cleaning, spreading manure, fumigating, and cutting the crops. \r\n\r\nShe does not have any educational degree, due to the fact that her parents had a low income and were unable to help her with her studies. From childhood she has made a living by cultivating coffee, which is what her family has done to this day. This is her only sustenance, as her parents taught her to work the land more than 15 years ago. She inherited the land on which her family works from her parents some time ago, in order to cover expenses such as food, clothing, studies, medicine, etc. The land is located 4.5 kilometers from her home, which they travel on foot every day.\r\n\r\nShe is currently asking for help to buy fertilizer and manure to maintain her coffee crops so that this harvest is healthy and profitable, in order to generate an income, obtain earnings and to be able to continue investing in the crops.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to see her two children graduate from university, because then they will be able to have a better lifestyle, a better future, a better education, and for them to be able to inherit the land on which they are working so they can continue making a profit from it and so that it can pass from generation to generation."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5.53,"image":{"id":1312204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer and manure to maintain her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-03-15T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-14T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonarda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5.53,"local_amount":100.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":109.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042108,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-15T01:59:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537661,"name":"Sergio Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sergio, se dedica al comercio de mercader\u00eda, cinchos, mochilas, llaveros ademas vende medicina natural, \u00e9l vive con su esposa y sus tres hijos, su casa es propia, su negocio lo tiene instalado en la vivienda y tambi\u00e9n tiene un puesto en el mercado, con esto ha logrado salir adelante con su familia.\n\nSergio, requiere de un  pr\u00e9stamo para seguir trabajando e invirtiendo en su negocio especificamente en la venta de medicinas naturales, adquiriendo variedad para las necesidades de los clientes, este credito le ayudara para la compra de los medicamentos.\nEl quiere mejorar su negocio, los clientes tambi\u00e9n ayudarle a los hijos en sus estudios, mejoramiento en la infraestructura de su vivienda.\n\n\n\n","en":"Sergio makes a living by selling merchandise, such as belts, backpacks, and keychains, as well as natural medicines.

She lives in the deparment of Chinandega, which is located in the western area of the country. She's a hardworking woman. She has been making traveling cosmetics sales for the past seven years in order to get ahead and support her household. In her free time she enjoys spending time with her son and cooking typical local dishes such as the \"gallo pinto\" (rice and beans) for him. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to go to college due to a lack of financial resources. She currently has a partner who helps her to get the cosmetics to the customers by using a tricycle which he shares with Isaura. As a hardworking, enterprising and responsible woman, she also bought a counter to display her products. That way she can also sell them from home to people who know of her business and where she lives. She requests this loan in order to purchase more beauty products (various cosmetics, shampoo, perfume, lotion, eyeliner, lip liner, moisturizer, blush, face mask, cologne, facial cleansing products, etc.) and therefore increase her sales.

She's a widow and has only one reason for living, her son Maycol, 18.  She has a house made of quality materials where she shares her family experiences.\r\n\r\nInitially she sold food in the wholesale market in her town, which enabled her to start building her house.  As time went by she managed to set up the first floor of her house and later she opened her grocery store.

She lives in a remote village in southern Kyrgyzstan.  Like many families in the area, Kanyshai and her husband farm, garden, and fatten livestock.  They started their business with only 2,000 KGS after the fall of the Soviet Union.  Kanyshai raises bulls, and the sale of meat products brings in around 9,000 KGS each month for the family.  With the goal of further developing her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 60,000 KGS to buy additional animals to resell.  What's left of the loan she plans to use to buy fertilizer and seeds to plant in the spring.  She plans on using the income from the loan to build a barn for her livestock."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":637.5,"image":{"id":1311387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a cow for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Syrt village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-15T04:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-14T04:40:01Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanyshai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":30482.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013969,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T13:57:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537325,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is a 32-year-old married woman and a mother of two children ages 12 and 7.

Additionally, she plants potatoes and corn each year on 4 hectares of land.  Her yearly income is around 120,000 from the sale of crops and livestock.  With the goal of further developing her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy more animals.

decade of cell phone retail management experience taught Kevin that if you serve customers well, they\u2019ll be loyal.  But before he could work, his parents taught him to be respectful and treat people the way he wants to be treated.\n\nTherefore, high morale is what makes Cell Phone Accessory Store a successful venture.\nKevin not only offers cell phone accessories such as car chargers, batteries, cases, Bluetooth items, and stereo headsets \u2013 he also repairs broken screens, is an authorized Cricket Communications dealer, and provides utility bill pay.\n\nOriginally from Helena, Arkansas, Kevin and his wife decided to move to Little Rock in 1997 for greater work opportunities.  He has owned his new business for about a year and a half.\n\n\u201cWhen I came up with the idea to open an accessory store, I dealt with customers who just wanted to fix a problem \u2013 mostly trying to find accessories for older phones. We have a lot of customers who want only the basic phones. That makes our store a lot more unique. We offer accessories for every carrier. We\u2019re not biased on the type of items we have.\u201d\n\nHe says he enjoys the profitability that comes with being an entrepreneur. \u201cI run my store just as I want to be treated,\u201d he says. However, Kevin\u2019s main goal is to earn financial freedom and to better provide for his family so they may continue to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nCurrently, Kevin has two employees. As the business continues to grow, he\u2019ll hire more.  He plans to cap his staff at 15 employees. His major goal is to open multiple stores. Before he gets to that point, he\u2019ll need to expand his customer pool, which means increasing his inventory.\n\n\u201cI did a ton of searching for lending companies,\u201d Kevin says. \u201cThen a customer came in and mentioned Accion Texas Inc. about a year ago. I applied for a loan, but decided not to go through with it because I was doing fine. With the type of cash I was asking for, I decided to hold off.\u201d\n\nLater, when he did need a loan to ramp up his business, he remembered Accion and ventured into the Little Rock office to re-apply \u2013 and was approved.\n\nHis loan will help to purchase more inventory, and therefore, increase the potential for more sales. \u201cI try to make sure I have everything. I only keep one or two of each product at a time,\u201d Kevin says. \u201cOther wireless stores send their customers to me if they don\u2019t have an item. Once the customer gets in, they find out we offer utility bill pay and cheaper accessories. As I continue to make profit, I can stock two or three products. I can use the capital to purchase more of what I need.\u201d\n\nWithout the loan, Kevin wouldn\u2019t be able to serve as many customers. \u201cClients don\u2019t want to wait, especially if they need something immediately,\u201d he says. The Accion loan helps him stock multiples of everything, keep his customers happy and, most importantly, keep up with his competition. \n\nWhile he is currently working on a website, check out his

Janitorial has a mission of only using environmentally-friendly cleaning products to shine up offices and hospitals.  \u201cWe have no bleaches or toxic chemicals in use when cleaning,\u201d says Andrew, owner of H&J Janitorial. \u201cWe lean towards environmentally-friendly ways of cleaning.\u201d\n\nThe Little Rock business holds contracts with multiple companies providing cleaning services. Andrew says: \u201cWe\u2019re starting off small but we\u2019re big on customer service. We believe if we can\u2019t do a good job, then we shouldn\u2019t be in business. We give everyone our best. If they don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve provided good service, we\u2019ll make it up.\u201d\n\nPrevious to owning H&J Janitorial, Andrew juggled two jobs. \u201cI wondered, \u2018Why am I still working when I could do it myself and give back to the community?\u2019 I\u2019m a hard worker and I get tired of coming in and just working and not obtaining what I fully need to obtain,\u201d he says.  \u201cI felt like I was coming up short not being an entrepreneur.\u201d Then in May 2012, Andrew went into the janitorial business in his hometown of Little Rock.\n\nJanitorial work is simple, Andrew says. He plans to continue securing smaller contracts - then eventually set his sights on larger ones. \u201cI did my research,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t want to clean up the office, but they want it to be neat and organized. That\u2019s where I think I can start.\u201d\n\nAndrew rents a van to haul equipment, pays insurance for it, fills it with gas, pays for its maintenance costs, and leases out a small office. Currently, he and a friend work, but are not yet earning a paycheck. \u201cWe\u2019re starting small and not going over our head,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cWe have a small office space to keep track of our paperwork and taxes, we rented a van and pay for equipment.\u201d Andrew plans to begin hiring within a year or two.\n\nKnowing he would need more capital to keep up with his business, he returned to the city\u2019s office, where he obtained his business license, and asked for information on additional funding. Directed to Accion Texas Inc.\u2019s website, Andrew applied for a loan.\n\nAccion aided Andrew by allowing him to put money towards van and equipment rental costs.  Without the loan, he says, \u201cIt would have taken me longer to get clients, which I was struggling to find.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1507.41,"image":{"id":1308726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

far as Jasper knows, there is not another business like his bi-monthly mortgage payment program in the Little Rock area. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve done a bit of research,\u201d he declares proudly.\r\n\r\nDoing business as Jazzy B, Jasper is an independent consultant of The Mortgage Manager.  He says he saves homeowners about $90,000 on interest and fees on a 30-year term loan.  \u201cI do mail requests for customers\u2019 bi-monthly mortgage payments,\u201d he says.  \r\n\r\nHis next goal is to offer his services to commercial businesses.\r\n\r\nJazzy B offers CDs to homeowners so they may enter their information and decide if it\u2019s beneficial to proceed doing business with their \u201cmortgage manager.\u201d\r\n\r\nJasper says he will have a website by the end of May 2013, which he believes will help expand his business. \u201cAll I had before was my email address,\u201d he says. With the website, Jasper will be able to refer his customers to the site, which will diminish his operating costs. For the time being, he plans to advertise on Craigslist.com. For more information about The Mortgage Manager, visit: http:\/\/www.mortgage-manager.org\/index.htm\/.\r\n\r\nJasper began his business in 2007, sending solicitations to potential homeowners. Now that he\u2019s been in this business for six years, Jasper plans to expand soon - adding one or two part-time employees within the next year or so.\r\n\r\nKnowing that he needed to update his equipment, Jasper applied and was approved for a loan from Accion Texas Inc.  He says, \u201cI need a new printer and fax machine.  I want to update to a smart phone or iPad to do more business directly, right there on the spot.\u201d The loan also covers the cost of stamps and envelopes. \r\n\r\nJasper\u2019s main goal was to earn income, retire from his former job, and go into his current business to help homeowners with their mortgage payments. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to cut down their payments, they can have a better life,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nJasper states that he is very satisfied with Accion.  \u201cThey did everything they said they\u2019d do,\u201d he

a professional musician, Tiaffo struggled to make peace with a band mate.  But the tension between them escalated and caused them to continually debate what type of music they should be creating. \n\n\u201cThe band wasn\u2019t making the type of music I really like,\u201d Tiaffo says, so he left the group to produce others\u2019 music. \u201cI thought it would be a good way to make money,\u201d he says. He then opened Excelsior Media Concern, a media production company that creates and produces beats and music videos.\n\nMost media producing companies in Tiaffo\u2019s hometown of Little Rock focus only on rap.  His company does much more.  \u201cIn addition to rap, we work with pop, gospel, and other types of music,\u201d he says.\n\nThe flexibility of creating his own schedule and having a job that allows him to express his creativity attracted Tiaffo to becoming self-employed.  \u201cIt was a matter of taking my strength and passion and just doing it.\u201d\n\nStarting out, he didn\u2019t know much about creating and producing music, other than the fact that he loved it.  Most of what he learned was hands-on trial and error. The self-taught Tiaffo says he read a lot of books and articles on how to properly obtain his goal of making music and music videos for a living.\n\nWhile researching the industry, Tiaffo read about Accion Texas Inc. in Black Enterprise Magazine.

He is from Managua which is in the central part of the country.  Levis stands out because of his kindness, responsibility and determination to improve his personal situation.  Unfortunately, he was unable to get a college degree but he would like to have studied systems engineering.\r\n\r\nThanks to his spirit of self improvement, he has been selling CD's for 20 years at one of the best markets in town.  He sells a wide variety of music and film CD's.  His work routine is spending 12 hours a day offering his products, which he enjoys very much since it is his main source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used as working capital to buy and sell CD's in an effort to increase his future income.  Levis Guillermo is grateful to Kiva lenders who help people with low incomes in poor countries such as Nicaragua to earn a decent living.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":430.35,"image":{"id":1312839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Music Discs & Tapes","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy music and film CD's.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-03-15T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-14T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Levis Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.57,"local_amount":1117.68,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1134.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364568384,"comment":null},{"amount":47.27,"local_amount":1134.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1151.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373162998,"comment":null},{"amount":47.6,"local_amount":1142.43,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1159.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381968770,"comment":null},{"amount":46.21,"local_amount":1108.97,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1125.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390830574,"comment":null},{"amount":52.92,"local_amount":1270.05,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1289.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399855372,"comment":null},{"amount":55.32,"local_amount":1327.56,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1347.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410130683,"comment":null},{"amount":134.46,"local_amount":3227.05,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T18:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3276.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545663,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-19T17:39:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":538117,"name":"Arcoiris Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Lilian Raquel esta unida de hecho de 45 a\u00f1os de edad, surso 3 a\u00f1os de educacion primaria, tiene 2 hijos ni uno de ellos estudia, ella se dedica a la compra crianza y venta de animales domesticos, inicio este negocio con pr\u00e9stamos familiares y hasta la fecha lleva 10 a\u00f1os de experiencia. \n\nOrganiza un grupo para solicitar un prestamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 para la compra de mas animales para criarlos y luego venderlos, en el futuro quiere ver su negocio prospero con mas corrales de los que pose\u00e9 ahora, las demas integrantes del grupo tambien se dedican a lo mismo y tambi\u00e9n a la venta de productos de consumo diario.
