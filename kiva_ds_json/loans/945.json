She also has a food stall and her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTeresita is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory and continue operating. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands. Teresita hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1190235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

The group\u2019s representative is called Ablawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana, and is pictured with her hand raised in the photo. This is the first time that this group has requested financial assistance from Alid\u00e9, and they have done so to increase their business levels. \r\n\r\nAblawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana is 39 years of age, and is married to Sylvain. The couple has three children, all of whom are at school but none of whom are dependent on them. Ablawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana lives with her children and husband, and she and her husband make sure that the various household expenses are covered. \r\n\r\nAblawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana went to school until secondary level, and about 10 years ago started her business selling fabrics, shoe, kitchen utensils, and perfume in a Benin neighborhood. She gets her supplies in a market in Benin and in Togo. Customer demand is growing, and given her limited means, she can no longer meet their requests. Due to this, and because of her lack of resources, Ablawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana and the other members of the Jesukpego 7 group have requested their first joint loan from Alid\u00e9.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1194180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

She lives with her parents and siblings whom she looks after in her parents\u2019 house. She has lived there since she was born. Her only responsibility is to keep her parents well cared-for. So she works without days off buying and selling lambs which are her specialty. \r\n\r\nShe travels into the high country where the animals are raised to buy from the farmers there. Then she transports them to the town where she sells them at various markets in the valley. All is going well with the work so Marleny feels content since she started doing this as a young woman. Every year she gets more customers and therefore earns more money. She earns the most in the months of March to September when the local people get ready for the festive season commemorating their animals.\r\n\r\nNow Marleny wishes to put her business on a stronger footing. She belongs to the Chilca Group and this is her seventh loan with MFP. She is very grateful for this financial support since it helps her with her business. She promises to repay the money according to the schedule. She is also pleased to be part of her group as all the members are responsible and committed.\r\n\r\nMarleny will use the money to buy sheep for her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1187312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He can also take advantage of the summer as well as the fact that the factory is located next to his house, to monitor the drying of the bricks.  During this time, he has had a lot of competition which will lead to a shortage of sand with in the next few years.  Due to this, he wants to start raising cows, and intensify that effort once he stops making bricks.  \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP, to whom he is very grateful of for their support which has allowed him to continue to invest in the growth of his business.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

Thanks to her dedication and good effort, the university supported her in order to cover the cost of her tuition.  She was also deserving of other help the institution gave to people with financial difficulties and good academic performance.  These supports allowed her to satisfactorily complete her undergraduate studies.\r\n\r\nThe move to this new city was a complete challenge.  This is because it meant not only encountering a new, different, and unknown world, but also because of the need to face conditions associated with the difficult financial situation her family was experiencing at the time.  With her mother unemployed and her father having passed away, she saw the need to combine her daily studies with different jobs that allowed her to receive a professional education.\r\n\r\nNow Karina\u2019s dream is to get a master\u2019s degree in the United Kingdom.  In order to do so, she has been preparing herself ever since she completed her undergraduate studies.  The only way to pay for the exams and the application expenses is to receive Kiva\u2019s support.\r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nI now work for an organization that seeks to develop and improve the quality of life for vulnerable families in the Valle del Cauca.  I do this work with love and dedication as I look for people like me to also have access to opportunities that will allow them to change their lives.\r\n\r\nSupport from Kiva would allow me to continue on with my dreams.  It would be a fundamental support to strengthen the proficiency that I need for application and later for tuition at the university (TOEL, registration documents).  These are expenses that, at this time and without this loan, would be very difficult to cover.  These expenses would keep me from realizing the dream I have been working on for over three years.\r\n\r\nThis is a dream I hope to share once I return to the country.  I will be devoting myself to helping other people who are less fortunate.  I will be working with a government agency to investigate and carry out public policies for the social and economic development of vulnerable populations.  In this way I will be looking for concrete mechanisms to support children and young people in our country to one day have better opportunities just like I did.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":141.67,"image":{"id":1195281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay the application expenses for her studies to get her master's degree in economic development.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":127358.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042085,"comment":null},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":127358.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710434,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T17:51:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":468921,"name":"El Remolino Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Banco Comunal se llama \u201cEl Remolino\u201d est\u00e1 conformado por 20 emprendedores quienes se dedican a diferentes a rubros, entre los cuales se encuentran; venta de ropa, lencer\u00eda, bazar, paqueter\u00eda, venta de perfumes, venta de articulos pl\u00e1sticos, servicios entre otros.

","en":"Cresensia is from Matagalpa, but she currently lives in Boaco.  She is 61 years old, married, and has four children.  She has had a small store for two years.  She started as a seamstress, and she sold \u201ccajetas\u201d (a sweet gelatin), which she delivered throughout her entire community.  After these two businesses she started a small store in her house.  She does have income from her husband and her children.\r\n\r\nThe hope she has for her business is to have a larger place to better locate her products so that her customers can see them.  She is requesting a Kiva loan in order to buy products like basic grains, dairy products, drinks, sweets, household cleaning products, and soap, etc.  It would help her business a lot because she would be able to get better income to invest in products to sell.\r\n\r\nHer plan for the future is to fix up a place in her house to use as a storage place for her products.  She will also continue investing in her business so that it grows.  Her goal is to use her income to buy a display case to display underwear and women\u2019s products, which are often requested by her customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1185411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy products like basic grains, dairy products, drinks, sweets, household cleaning products, and soap, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T15:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T15:50:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cresencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51,"local_amount":51,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308449081,"comment":null},{"amount":49,"local_amount":49,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443942,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048888,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T00:29:05Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:21:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470707,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita is 56 years old and lives in Caloocan, the Philippines.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEstela dreams to have their own house through all her hard work on her business.

She started a business five years ago with the goal of providing for her family's needs, as her husband is a taxi driver and does not earn enough to support the family.  She has a store near the central hospital where she sells food and dry goods.  A few years ago, Farida's life took a difficult turn when her husband suddenly became ill and underwent surgery.  After the operation, her husband couldn't work for two years.  She thought long and hard about the solution to the problem of how to feed her family and decided to rent a storefront and borrow money from relatives.  At first, it was very difficult, but she gradually grew accustomed and learned the skills of her trade.  Farida is a second-time borrower with our organization.  She has a good credit history and wants to expand her business so she can increase her income.  She wants to use the proceeds from her business to educate her children.

The loan will be used to buy more maize to sell and will help Zulaina to generate greater profits. This will help her parents pay the school fees for her younger siblings. \n\nZulaina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

With this business, Chizi is able to sustain her extended family and she has high expectations for growing this business since she works hard every day. \n\nToday her main clients are neighbors and passer-by. However she wants to take more opportunities. Her investment plan consists of diversifying her merchandise to including more retail items, and adding more products requested by clients such as bundles of clothes for resale. This will improve her working conditions and amplify her product selection according to clients' demands. This is why she is requesting Kiva a loan to expand her business. She believes she can succeed due to the high demand, her strength in her performance, and work discipline. All of these qualities will help her business grow.

Unfortunately, Magnifique\u2019s family was forced to flee from the war in DRC, and he has grown up as a refugee in Namibia.\n \nMagnifique shows a passion for empowering youth to make better choices. Magnifique has an interest in youth entertainment and  showed that he has entreprenieral skills when he started his own production initiative called MN Productions to encourage youth that they can have fun without alcohol.  He continued to develop this entertainment company to provide safe entertainment for young people even though he faced a few challenges along the way (not all young people were interested in his idea of alcohol free entertainment!) To further develop his interest in the entertainment industry, Magnifique interned with an audio company to train himself in the mechanics of running technical audio systems. \n\nMagnifique is also particularly environmentally conscious. He created the R CUBED Committee (Recycle x Reduce and Re-use) in his high school, which he says allowed for his peers to have an avenue to make their science classes practical. \u201cIt is important for students to be involved in things they care about\u201d, says Magnifique. \u201cSchool is about implementing accessed information and not just remembering it for exams,\u201d he says. \n\nMagnifique\u2019s impressive leadership skills have been apparent from a young age. At the age of only 16, Magnifique became the Junior Deputy Mayor of the Rehoboth Junior Town Council \u2013 a prestigious position that he was selected for by his school principal based on his leadership potential.

He sees problems as challenges to be overcome \u2013 the traits of a true entrepreneur. This quality was shown clearly when, during secondary school in Kenya, Dawit noticed that students in his school were not focused on their education and had trouble understanding the material. Dawit decided to do something about the problem and formed a club called \u201cFuture Leaders\u201d aimed at tutoring young students. Through this club, he coordinated a group of top students in the 11th and 12th grades to tutor other students three days a week.

Furthermore, he even started a non-governmental organization called Tesfagoh that supports and takes care of HIV carriers. In doing so, he was able to raise the money to help his friend's family and also increase awareness regarding HIV\/AIDS.  \n\nAcademically, Dawit has always been a high achieving student.  In secondary school in Kenya, he was among the top performing students in all of his classes. In recognition of his leadership and academic excellence, Dawit was given the opportunity to participate in a forum on women\u2019s education in Ethiopia held in Addis Ababa.\n\nDawit is also passionate about environmental conservation and climate change. He has been instrumental in creating awareness about these issues in his school, using drama as a medium. As Dawit\u2019s knowledge of environmental issues has grown, so too has the impact of his awareness campaigns. Dawit was able to share his knowledge with villagers in his community, to whom he was able to teach sustainable methods of planting and growing seeds. Dawit continues to nurture his keen interest in environmental conservation by studying issues of poor management of water and environmental protection, in addition to his full time studies at ALA.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1195247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dawit","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748406,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735289,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614222,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T03:02:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":472758,"name":"Gift","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gift is a 17-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nShe was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nGift is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to help her conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student-run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nGift grew up in Mombasa, Kenya and is one of a family of seven. \n\nGift\u2019s demonstrated passion for public service was evident in her extensive involvement in her community and in her high school.

It comprises seventeen entrepreneurs who work in different trades, which include selling bath tissue, \"pan amasado\" (a Chilean homemade bread), salads, EVA foam crafts, steak sandwiches, pastries, and other services. They all belong to the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica is one of the members of this communal bank. In the picture she is the fifth person from the right, wearing black pants and a black jacket, with brown long hair. She has worked selling sunflower seeds for one year. These seeds can be used in different ways: to make oil, to feed animals, or for human consumption. She says she works from home, where she roasts the sunflower seeds and packs them for sale. She works Monday through Sunday and distributes her schedule according to her availability.\r\n\r\nShe buys whatever merchandise and supplies she needs to sell her sunflower seeds from distributors, and at the supermarket she buys low-cost bags to pack the seeds, which are the most affordable.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan only to purchase sunflower seeds.\r\n\r\nOne of M\u00f3nica's goals is to purchase some items, such as ice cream, to sell in addition to the sunflower seeds and generate more income so that she may access a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica lives with her husband and their two children, who are sixteen and nine and are in school. On a business level, her dreams are to expand her business and grow as a microentrepreneur by adding more and more products to sell so that she can offer her family good stability in life.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza has given her, because it has allowed her to invest in her business. She also feels very comfortable around the other entrepreneurs in the communal bank group, because they share different activities and interests, and that provides some leisure. As far as the trainings offered at the meetings, they have helped her manage her business better.\r\n\r\nTalca belongs to the Maule region, located in the central area of the country. It constitutes the administrative, financial, and cultural center of the region, being the most important city of Chile's central valley. In Chile, there is a curious saying about Talca: \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\" (Talca, Paris, and London). Among the myths explaining this, some say it is derived from something originally said by an Englishman: \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca looks like London) on account of the fog that frequently covers the city during the winter season, as it does in the capital of the United Kingdom.

He is 46 years old, married and raising three children.  His children, Olim, Subhiya and Shukrona, are very smart and well-behaved.  They are 16, 13 and 3 years old.

She also plans to buy a cow, which allows her to gather more milk.\r\n \r\nKristine dreams of developing her farm so that her sons will be able to get involved in agriculture and earn enough income to sustain their families in the future. This loan is important for her to develop the farm and reach this goal.

This form of work allows her to generate income for supporting her family as best she can, as she is in a common-law relationship and has two children.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the training in health and credit. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4875,"image":{"id":1188267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-09-15T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-15T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":4875,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeaneth Susy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosamary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulma Yuwana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":33838.38,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4875.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4827.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4827.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4827.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4827.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4827.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4827.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":702.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":695.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":695.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":695.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":695.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":695.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":695.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":702.4,"local_amount":4875.47,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4888.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260901,"comment":null},{"amount":695.43,"local_amount":4827.13,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4840.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490613,"comment":null},{"amount":695.43,"local_amount":4827.13,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:21:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4840.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095472,"comment":null},{"amount":695.43,"local_amount":4827.13,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4840.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235547,"comment":null},{"amount":695.43,"local_amount":4827.13,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4840.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617382,"comment":null},{"amount":695.43,"local_amount":4827.13,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4840.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347171980,"comment":null},{"amount":695.45,"local_amount":4827.26,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4840.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914214,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T13:38:51Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T18:18:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471190,"name":"Neziel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neziel is 27 years old and lives in the Philippines.

He is a mason by profession, he builds houses and improves homes together with his children, now that they have learned the profession of masonry and they complete work contracts. He also works as a farmer, specifically by planting corn. This time around he wants to sow 14,000 square meters of corn. He has been doing this activity for more than 35 years. He told us that his family worked on this productive activity, that it is part of his family heritage.\r\n\r\nHe buys the fertilizers, manure, seeds, formulates in the markets in the region that he visits at a distance of two kilometers from his house. \r\n\r\nThis is the second Kiva loan that Juan seeks and it is to purchase: eight sacks of fertilizers, 50 pounds of seeds, two litres of herbicides and payment for manual labor.\r\n\r\nThe most basic and most important necessity that would be met by the investment is the planting of corn for him and his family's consumption. Now that the earth is prepared in anticipation, he feels an urge to plant the corn in rows. Moreover, he will obtain the corn seeds now, because later in the season it is very expensive and he does not have sufficient money to buy it. This way he can improve his quality of life. It doesn't worry him because this product can be stored. \r\n\r\nJuan has plans for the future to continue improving his home because it lacks several details in order to be finished. He has made these plans for the end of the year, when El Salvador is in the rainy season.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":990790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy eight sacks of fertilizers, 50 pounds of seeds, two litres of herbicides and payment for manual labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-09-15T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-15T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Irene","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":140.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":146.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":153.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":159.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":147.36,"local_amount":147.36,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":147.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383129,"comment":null},{"amount":155.93,"local_amount":155.93,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":155.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331970578,"comment":null},{"amount":158.92,"local_amount":158.92,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":158.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069189,"comment":null},{"amount":137.79,"local_amount":137.79,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":137.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525483,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T20:30:03Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:38:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":469437,"name":"Cachi Lipe Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cCACHI LIPE\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el tercer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Achacachi, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora es la Catalina es la Presidenta.

of Ina, in the district of Parcona with his partner and young daughter. Despite being so young, he is a very kind, hardworking and enthusiastic person, who along with his partner, have great desire to get ahead in life. Unfortunately, because of the need to work to cover their expenses, Miguel wasn't able to pursue a professional career, though he would have greatly liked to do so. In his free time he likes to play soccer with his friends and on some occasions he cooks a delicious beef stew to share with his family. \r\n\r\nWith much effort, enthusiasm and the support of his partner, Miguel launched his small business of selling vegetables. He has a small space in a central market in his district where he makes his sales. Everyday, from the early hours of the morning, he starts his work and works approximately 12 hours daily. He thinks it is going well because of his dedication and for the kind treatment he provides his customers. Miguel is very grateful for the loans from Kiva. Thanks to the assistance provided he will be able to purchase ingredients to prepare spices like: mustard, various ground aji, ground coriander, and pepper among others. This way Miguel's business will be better stocked and he hopes to increase his sales and income, which will allow him to expand his business little by little so he can continue working and striving, along with his family, to get ahead in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1188326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"purchase ingredients to prepare spices.

Sheily says the business is profitable as there is a demand for what she sells. Her plans for the future include continuing with the business and growing it. She would also like to open a grocery store.\r\n\r\nThis is her 9th loan with MFP and she wishes to continue working with the institution so she can complete her objectives. She also enjoys working with her community bank and helping other people improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nWith the 2,500 soles loan she is seeking, Sheily will buy soft drinks of different brands and flavours as well as candy in large amounts so that her store is well-stocked. She will be able to buy at lower prices because of the volume of purchases."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1188330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buy different brands and flavours of soft drinks and candy\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-15T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-15T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sheily ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":377.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":398.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":397.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":428.22},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":444.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":454.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":147.3,"local_amount":377.69,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":384.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452365,"comment":null},{"amount":155.44,"local_amount":398.56,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":405.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447545,"comment":null},{"amount":154.84,"local_amount":397.04,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":403.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053443,"comment":null},{"amount":167.01,"local_amount":428.22,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":435.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188368,"comment":null},{"amount":173.24,"local_amount":444.2,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":451.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572299,"comment":null},{"amount":177.17,"local_amount":454.29,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:37Z","rounded_local_amount":462.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121958,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-29T15:16:24Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471205,"name":"Amalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amalia is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a buying & selling of vegetables business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 23,000 through NWTF to purchase additional vegetables to sell for her buying & selling of vegetables business.\r\n\r\nAmalia has been in this business for 17 years.

Dany hopes the new motorbike will work well, unlike the old one which is very often broken and costs lots of money to fix, and that as a result, she will be able to save some money for other future needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1192204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy a decent motorbike to support her husband\u2019s business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-15T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-15T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dany","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288735,"comment":null},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315519266,"comment":null},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:08:37Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118846,"comment":null},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265919,"comment":null},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:58:30Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339641254,"comment":null},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197282,"comment":null},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841399,"comment":null},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046592,"comment":null},{"amount":122,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837816,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T02:14:09Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":469440,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LA SRA JUANITA TIENE 50 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD, ESTA CASADA CON EL SR.

Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

However, lack of working capital is still the main challenge for his business. \r\n\r\nSarun\u2019s group consists of two males and this is the seventh loan for his group with VisionFund. The past loans have helped him to have sufficient food and support his children\u2019s education. He and his group member are applying for a loan of 1,100,000KHR each. As the leader, Sarun will use his share to buy more grocery items for his wife to sell such as eggs, salt, sugar and so on. He hopes to increase his income further through selling these grocery products so as to improve his family's standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1192227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more

reason Bonevasius attends lectures at the Academy of Maritime Nusantara is that he would like to work in port administration in Indonesia.

The local conditions and the situation of his origin motivate him to learn and aspire to be a professional employee in a harbor. \r\n\r\nHowever, Bonevasius faces difficulties in his studies because his two parents have died. During this time, he was funded by his siblings, but his siblings are now married and each has a child.

She has a machine that she bought with her savings and learned to sew on her own by watching her friends and helping them. She also sells meals, breakfasts as well as lunches, in front of her house. She started sewing more than 21 years and selling food three years ago. She sewed first for her relatives and neighbors but has now succeeded in expanding her customer base thanks to her fine work. She relies on help from her sister, who is also learning the skills of a seamstress.\r\n\r\nShe feels her business is successful because of the good profit it generates. She likes her business because she can count on an income to help her husband with household expenses.
