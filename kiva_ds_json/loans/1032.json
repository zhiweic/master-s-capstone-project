She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

is Angela, 45, a  resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Vicente, a carpenter, and a mother to her children. Together with her husband, she manages their own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAngela operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugsof many sizes and shapes, from round palm-sized ones, to much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers come up every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAngela hopes to expand her business and to have more customers. She dreams that all her children will finish their studies and that they will have a good life.

Before operating the superstore, he had been transporting livestock, timber, and meats using his truck. Still today, during his free time, he transports the above mentioned items to customers. \r\n\r\nWithin the vicinity of his superstore, there is no other similar type of business operating, so he has attracted quite a number of stable customers to his superstore. His wife works at a state specialized inspection agency, and his two elder children study at high school. \r\n\r\nLast summer, Munkhtur made an extension to the store and didn\u2019t complete its door area, which is the primary source of losing its warmth. As they operate in their superstore day and night, they are in urgent need of insulating the superstore, as it can be considered their second home. So Munkhtur is requesting a loan of 4,800,000 MNT to purchase construction and insulation materials. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the family can work in a very well-insulated and comfortable superstore, as well as burn less coal, thus contributing to the efforts against air

His wife is an elementary school teacher, but now stays at home with their infant child, who is one year old. Their first son, four years old, goes to kindergarten. Bilguun's mother is retired from work and lives with them. \r\n\r\nThe family resides in their own house on a plot of land. As winter comes to Mongolia, the family is in urgent need of an insulated house -- if not, the mother and baby will be frozen to their core and may get sick. So Bilguun is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase construction materials such as bricks, foam, fiberglass and cement. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the construction, the family will be able to live in a comfortable and warm place. At the same time, the borrower will be able to work without worrying about the well-being of his wife and children.

Its eight members are organized under a governing board, where Veneranda is the president. The businesses that the members of the community association manage are diverse, but include: blanket weavers, drivers, cheese mongers, and clothing makers. \r\n\r\nThe loan received will benefit these small micro-entrepreneurs in distinct ways. Veneranda, who is an integral part, indicates that she joined Pro Mujer six months ago, upon the invitation of a promoter from the institution who visited Veneranda in her home. At present, Veneranda has a business selling cheeses, potatoes, and flour, a business she inherited from her parents who have always worked selling these items.  \r\n\r\nThe loan which they have applied for will be used to purchase a cow, which they will acquire wholesale from one of the surrounding communities. Later, once it has grown, it will be sold in the city of El Alto. This business allows Veneranda to generate income to be able to help with expenses around the house, as she is married and has two children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Veneranda answers that she likes the savings.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

After years of experience in that area, Minata decided to sell grains: cowpeas, millet, fonio (a millet-like grain), corn, sorghum, etc.    \n\nAfter having properly repaid her three previous loans, Minata is on her fourth loan with Soro Yiriwaso, which she'll use to buy three tons of millet from village farmers (from Ouelessebougou, Mana, and Moridjambougou) and on rare occasions from local wholesalers. She sells her goods for cash, for credit, at home, in the Ouelessebougou market, and at local fairs - to a clientele consisting mainly of end consumers.\n\nMinata would like to earn a monthly profit of 50000 FCFA, which she'll use to help her husband support the family, to repay the loan, and to reinvest in her business.

Bujigmaa, 47 years old, lives with her family in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia. Her son provides taxi services to local people by using his own car. One of her twin daughters has been working as a specialist at a supermarket since 2009, and other one runs her own business. Her daughter-in-law sells clothes at an outdoor market. She herself has been working as a doorkeeper at an electricity and heating station since 2004. Her two grandchildren go to kindergarten. \n\nThis extended family resides in their house on a plot of land surrounded with fences. The fences are built with planks. As winter come to Mongolia, strong storms may break down the fences. Additionally, wooden planks are prone to fire, whether accidental or on purpose. They also deteriorate over the years. So they have decided to replace the planks with blocks in order to strengthen the fences. Advantages of block fences are an invulnerability to fire and the ability to keep the family warm by blocking the winds. People with wooden fences repair them by simply cutting forest trees. In order to protect the forest, block fences are encouraged everywhere. Mrs. Bujigmaa is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to purchase blocks. As a result the family can live in a safe place without the fire hazard of wooden fences.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community members. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Analie is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnalie hopes that her business will continue to grow and that her family will be happier. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance

His wife works as an accountant at an organization which protects residents' rights. \r\n\r\nFrom 1988 to 1990, Ochirsuren worked as a service man. Two years later, he worked as a bus driver until 1996 and soon began his own transportation service. \r\n\r\nThe microvan Ochirsuren uses for transportation has deteriorated over the years, so he is in need of repairing it or purchasing a new one.

So, he is requesting a loan of MNT 4,000,000 to purchase a new microvan. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the family can generate more income, which will improve their living standard.

They belong to a non-tribal community and live at the outskirts of Imphal East in a small village in Manipur state located in the North Eastern part of India. Taxi service is available but it takes about one hour drive to reach the place.\r\n\r\nChaoba is the profiled member pictured with raised hand. She is 40 years old and she is a mother to two sons and two daughters. Her husband is a hired lorry driver and the main earner of the family. Her three older children are school drop-outs and now her youngest daughter aged 14 years is the only member of the family going to school. Chaoba is determined to provide to her youngest daughter everything that she failed to give the older children. She is happy that every member of the family, too, supports the youngest daughter with the necessary requirements for her schooling. \r\n\r\nIn order to supplement the family income, before the loans Chaoba used to earn money on anything that came her way. She even worked as a lorry labourer doing work such as loading and unloading sand and grindstones from the truck. In 2010, she joined the group to access loans and start a business activity of her own.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she purchased 10 bags of unhulled rice and paid INR 450 per bag weighing 40 kilogram each. She would then process the rice at a rice mill to separate the husk from the grain and sell it for a profit. With the second loan, she was able to expand her business with better profit earning. Her elder son helps her with the business. Apart from meeting the loan liability, she managed to save around INR 500 on a monthly basis together with a savings group of 30 members.\r\n\r\nShe plans to purchase a sewing machine for her other daughter to enhance her embroidery art and also wishes to own one of those rice mills down the road for future income opportunity. For this she means to save as much as she can with the help of her family members.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan now to continue with her rice-selling business. With limited capital she was not in a position to do the business on large scale. She will use the loan to buy unhulled rice and stock it to sell when rice is in demand for a higher profit.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too need a loan to continue and improve upon their respective income-generating activities. Vegetable vending, sand sieving (quarrying), poultry farming, and grocery store business are some of the activities that the members are engaged in.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1271506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy bags of paddy rice, extract the grain from the husk, and sell it for a profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-07T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-06T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chaoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binashakhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibemcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bembem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memtonbi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tamphasana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandhyarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T13:15:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":514639,"name":"Ruth Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2010 these 12 Tribal women created a platform for themselves and formed a group called Ruth.

Lizeth lives with her parents, whom she loves very much and supports with the fruit of her labor.  They were able to support her despite their humble situation, and she managed to study education.\r\n\r\nLizeth wasn't able to find a job in her field, so with great effort and savings she managed to start her own business selling cosmetics.  She works about 10 hours a day and can serve up to 10 customers because she visits them in their homes.

Homero","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Since his previous Accion Texas Inc. loan in January, Hector Homero says his business matured. Working with surrounding El Paso business owners to produce positive results, the Hispanic entrepreneurship instructor, business coach, CEO and founder of Ascend: Entrepreneurial Growth says the recipe for a good business is a good theory and process. This year, Hector Homero refined his process leading to business maturity. \n\n\u201cThis year, I\u2019ve nailed that down better and have seen results,\u201d he says, defining theory as the idea and the value of business structure, which differs between entrepreneurs. \u201cI see the results clearer and more predictable now than last year,\u201d he says. Hector Homero added he\u2019s also learned, when focusing on the structure of the business, he can help an entrepreneur find the root of an issue then produce a quick solution. Hector Homero says he of course wants to guide his clients \u201cthrough the long haul,\u201d but his clientele doesn\u2019t always stay past the beginning stages.\n\nIn his last interview, Hector Homero stated, \u201c89 percent of small business owners in Texas are sole proprietors,\u201d leaving them with 100 percent of the job obligations.  This statistic still holds true. As a sole proprietor himself, Hector Homero says he needs to improve his business before hiring, though he needs help now. \u201cThe idea is to grow,\u201d he says. \u201cBusiness growth is economic growth to the community,\u201d however, it is a challenge to obtain, he says. Currently, Hector Homero offers one-on-one sessions which he then merges into round-table learning sessions he says helps clients network. \n\nThis is Hector Homero\u2019s third loan with micro-lender Accion Texas. He says, \u201cAccion has helped me make the next step, it\u2019s not a big one, but it\u2019s one I need. I like Accion a lot. What I\u2019m trying to do now, what I would like to be able to do, is get my business to pay off this loan and strategize a larger loan to get my business to the next level. Accion has become a part of my growth plan.\u201d\n\nHis latest loan is to market his business and update software. Hector Homero purchased a Nuance program called Dragon Naturally Speaking, which transcribes voice to text and helps him cut the hour of work he normally takes to manually transcribe every meeting\u2019s notes and track a client\u2019s progress. \u201cEverything I do now is the hard way; I need to be more efficient,\u201d he says. \u201cI need to work on my web page to where it works for me.\u201d Hector Homero says to better his site, it would take the creation of more resources and a newsletter to draw people to the site.\n\nTo find out more about Hector Homero and his business, visit his website at: http:\/\/www.ascendeg.com.

She lives in Beit Hanoun, Jabalia with her husband. Iman's husband is employed, with a very low wage. They want to improve their home by buying some necessary furniture such as living room furniture. \r\n\r\nEman took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to buy new living room furniture. This loan will help Eman and her husband to enjoy living in their house and improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

It takes about 45 minutes to drive from the main city of Imphal. \r\n\r\nBimola is the profiled member pictured with her hand raised. She is 31 years old and a mother to two daughters who are still studying in a private boarding school in the neighboring town. Her husband is a farmer by profession with no source of regular income. In order to supplement the family income,  with the help of her parents, she managed to open a small shop on a small budget. In her shop she sells paan, cigarettes and the like, and a few eatables like chips. This is the way she tried to earn an income before her loan activities.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2010, she expanded her store. She used the loan to extend her store to room size. With part of the loan, she stocked the store with cooking oil, onions, tomatoes, spices in satchets (meat masala, turmeric powder, ginger, chili) and potatoes and sold them at a profit. She was able to repay her loan without any problem. With her second loan, she was able to purchase stock in greater quantities and she brought in more items such as washing detergents, sugar, milk packets, cell batteries and daily use items. With the money she saved, she started selling vegetables in the morning and afternoon such as coriander, cauliflower, cabbage and locally found vegetables while her husband did the cooking and managed the store in her absence. She is very happy with her husband's helping nature. She is in a better position to support her children with their educational requirements. Above all, she is happy with all the appreciation that she gets from her parents with the good start that she has.\r\n\r\nShe has been saving and in the future, she plans to purchase one minivan to service as a passenger carrier between Imphal. She needs a loan to continue with her selling activities. She will use the loan to increase her store stock to sell. Likewise, the rest of the group members need this loan to do better with their income-generating undertakings. The members\u2019 activities are sand sieving, local wine vending, vegetables vending and weaving traditional clothes, respectively according to their earning convenient.    \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1271517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more stock to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-07T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-06T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bimola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibecha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Akashini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nupimacha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T15:11:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513404,"name":"Rayito De Sol Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Rayito de Sol est\u00e1 conformado por nueve mujeres responsables y trabajadoras que se esmeran siempre por sacar adelante a su familia, estas mujeres viven en una comunidad donde la gente adem\u00e1s de dedicarse al cultivo de ma\u00edz tambi\u00e9n se dedica al comercio es un lugar peque\u00f1o y muy tranquilo.

They belong to a non-tribal community and live in a small village on the outskirts of the Imphal East district in Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. This part of the state is famous for brewing local wine and the flavor can closely be associated with that of Tequila and Vodka.\r\n\r\nMemcha is the profiled member pictured with her hand raised. She studied up to class VIII. Now she is 51 years old and is a mother to a daughter and two sons who are already in their late 30\u2019s. All her children are school dropouts due to the poor conditions of the family.  Her husband is a farmer by profession and is a daily wage earner. In order to supplement the family income, she has been running a pickle store with a small budget to earn income. Due to insufficient capital, she can never upgrade her store with other products to sell other than a few eatables and self-made pickles.  \r\n\r\nIn 2010, with her first loan, she bought stocks to sell for profits. She used the loan to stock grocery items to sell such as onions, tomatoes, dal, cooking oil, fermented fish, sugar, milk and varieties of eatables. Her wish to expand her store business was fulfilled, for which she is ever grateful. With the sale of the store stocks, she collected larger profits that she used wisely. With her second loan too, she bought store stock to sell. With the saved profits, she renovated her store by making proper shelves to stack the items. Apart from the loan liability, she was able to save as much as INR 700 per month by way of local savings with 25 other members, where the total money collected monthly is utilized on a rotating basis.\r\n  \r\nSince her children are coming of age, she wishes to build and provide a good house for them. She also plans to purchase a paddy field for the family's sustainability, where she can keep her two sons engaged and busy with something useful. With the expansion of her store business, she let her daughter manage the store while she helped her two sons with their quarrying activities to increase their income.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan to continue with her general store business. She will use the loan to stock fresh products to sell at her store. With steady improvement and with the loan, she is making progress towards expanding her store. Likewise, the rest of the group members too wish to do better with their respective income-generating activities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1271524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fresh stock to sell at her store ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-07T23:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-06T23:00:15Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Memcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrabi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Senubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sorojini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rojita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T16:41:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":513846,"name":"Jose Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jose es un joven que vive en la calida ciudad de Chincha, la cual no solo se caracteriza por su clima caluroso sino tambien por ser la cuna de grandes glorias del deporte peruano, asimimo sus pobladores tiene un don especial para la preparacion de alimentos ya que lo hacen de manera deliciosa.

They wanted the name of a flower or a plant; however in the midst of joking around the name \u201caroma\u201d occurred to a man who is no longer a group member.\r\n\r\nMagdalena is a group member.  She relates that she\u2019s 52-years-old and married to Apolinar for the last 34 years.  They formed a family with children but they are all grown now and living independently from this couple.  Do\u00f1a Elena, as she\u2019s affectionately called, relates that she\u2019s been selling all types of clothes for the last 8 years but on this occasion is asking for a loan to only buy clothes for babies.  She relates that she started her activity because one of her children sold records but then changed over to selling clothes and Do\u00f1a Elena decided to also sell clothes.  She sells only on Mondays in one of the state\u2019s municipalities.  She\u2019s very happy and grateful for the loan that the institution is granting her because thanks to the loan she\u2019ll be able to buy more baby clothes for her little stand and will be able to expand and her profits will grow.  Do\u00f1a Elena commented: \u201cFor me it\u2019s better to have a wide variety of clothes to offer my customers who then happily return to buy more clothes for their entire family from me.\u201d  \r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas season, Elena always has problems with her stand because during this season the authorities in charge of assigning the stands give preference to those merchants selling Christmas items like sets of lights, trees, tree decorations, etc. and often she\u2019s left without a stand during this season.  Elena\u2019s goal is to someday have a stand where she can sell her clothes and not have to be going through this time after time.\r\n\r\nThe group members are Adela who will buy corn to make tortillas and a scale, Linares and Alejandra who will buy chickens, Teresa will buy pigs, Lourdes and Adriana will buy sheep, Agripina will sell backpacks, Laura and Mar\u00eda Maura will buy chickens and turkeys.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6200,"image":{"id":1261386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy baby clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dolores Hidalgo, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-07T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-06T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":6200,"lender_count":137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Maura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linares","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":79000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":9875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1937.5,"local_amount":24687.5,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":24760.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284940,"comment":null},{"amount":1550,"local_amount":19750,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":19808.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199227,"comment":null},{"amount":1550,"local_amount":19750,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19808.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596022,"comment":null},{"amount":1162.5,"local_amount":14812.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":14856.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663446,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T15:18:15Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":514411,"name":"Leonid","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434 -

Jhosep will use the money to buy several cans of pumpkin seeds as well as natural fertilizer to spread among his crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1271675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pumpkin seeds and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhosep ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":328.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":340.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":361.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":363.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":383.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":393.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":407.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":422.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.18,"local_amount":407.95,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":416.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573192,"comment":null},{"amount":130.88,"local_amount":327.19,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":333.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122837,"comment":null},{"amount":117.87,"local_amount":294.69,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":300.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868659,"comment":null},{"amount":145.44,"local_amount":363.59,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":370.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577495,"comment":null},{"amount":153.22,"local_amount":383.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":390.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529730,"comment":null},{"amount":157.28,"local_amount":393.2,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":401.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974762,"comment":null},{"amount":163.02,"local_amount":407.55,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":415.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996068,"comment":null},{"amount":169.11,"local_amount":422.78,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":431.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863691,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-11T00:21:54Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":514869,"name":"Marlaine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlaine is 30 years old and married with 7 children.

However, Zaynura knows how to weave carpets, a craft she learned from her grandmother.  Her plan is to turn this craft into a business, and to make some money out of it.\r\n\r\nWith this goal in mind, Zaynura has taken a course entitled \"Achieving success\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and she has earned a certificate.

She lives with Francisco, who is 32, with whom she has a little daughter named Mayte, who is only 5 years old and to whom she wants to offer a better quality of life. She lives in her own house, which she built with the help of her partner. She lives there with her family, and each of its members takes a part in moving forward. \r\n\r\nCindy's work consists of selling articles of clothing exclusively for children. Every day she goes to the homes of her friends, neighbors, and relatives to offer all the products that she has for sale. She doesn't hesitate for a moment to knock on each of their doors and convince them to acquire some item. The clothing that she offers is of different sizes and in various styles and colors. In general she sells on credit while only in some cases can she sell for cash. She has been doing this work for three years. She works alone, either in her home or in the homes of her various customers. She likes her work a lot, since it allows her to have time to spend with her family. Furthermore, it allows her to help with the household finances. She wants to continue working and begin to expand her business, also selling shoes for children, but for now she is concentrating only on keeping her place in the market and in the future expanding her little business. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan from MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support, since this way she feels more certain of advancing in her work. Similarly, she promises once again to make her payments punctually, as she did with her past loans. She is satisfied with being a member of her communal bank, since all the members are very responsible and united.

ayuda cuando requieren su apoyo. Vive solo y aunque a veces esto le cause mucha tristeza y preocupaci\u00f3n por su futuro continua trabajando duro para conseguir el sustento diario. Vive en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nTe\u00f3filo estableci\u00f3 un taller de enderezada y pintura de autos, gracias a la experiencia y conocimientos que su compadre y amigo le imparti\u00f3 desde hace 40 a\u00f1os. Trabaja de 8 a 10 horas en su taller y a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os ha logrado mejorar su negocio y obtener fidelidad y recomendaciones por parte de sus clientes. Alrededor de su taller existen otros que prestan los mismos servicios con los cuales es dif\u00edcil competir en precios porque Te\u00f3filo ha tenido varios impedimentos para conseguir pr\u00e9stamos que le permitan mejorar la variedad de los productos que ofrece, pero cuando recurri\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, todo cambi\u00f3 pues gracias a la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva, all\u00ed le facilitaron un pr\u00e9stamo con la agilidad y confianza que siempre esper\u00f3 y el cual lo utilizar\u00e1 solo en compra de materia prima y productos al por mayor para obtener mayor descuento y as\u00ed ofrecer precios competitivos a sus clientes. Las ganancias que obtenga de esta inversi\u00f3n los utilizar\u00e1 en parte para crear un fondo de ahorro para sustentar su vejez, pues por varios problemas de salud que le han molestado en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, Te\u00f3filo ha reflexionado que \u00e9l no estar\u00e1 siempre habilitado para realizar el trabajo que tiene.  ","en":"Te\u00f3filo is a 62 year old man who completed elementary school.  He has two adult children on their own, but the help him when he needs it.  He lives alone, although this causes him some sadness and concern about his future, he continues to work hard to gain his daily sustenance.  He lives in the Rio Verde Parish of Santo Domingo, the provincial capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, an Ecuadorian province that has had large growth in recent years.  Its capital is a city where the most attractive and appealing things are the delicious fruits and the food from this place.  It also has considerable business and has become a commercial trading port between the country\u2019s mountains and coasts.  It also includes various tourist attractions that, along with its warm weather, are very well known by local and foreign tourists.  This is the reason that most of its residents have started some type of merchant or service business for tourists.\r\n\r\nTe\u00f3filo set up an auto body and paint shop, thanks to his experience and knowledge his friend passed onto him 40 years ago.  He works 8 to 10 hours in his shop and has managed to improve his business and obtain loyalty and recommendations from his customers.  Others around his shop provide the same types of services so it\u2019s difficult to compete on price because Te\u00f3filo has had some trouble getting loans that allow him to expand the variety of products that he offers.  Everything changed when he approached Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.

She lives with Aurelio, who is 61, and with whom she has six children, to whom she offered education and raised with good manners and values. She lives in her own house, which she was able to construct 9 years ago with the help of her partner. Now she lives there with only one daughter and three grandchildren. She makes her greatest effort to advance for the good of her grandchildren and so that she can have a tranquil old age in the future.\r\n\r\nDoli's work consists of selling clothing, sandals, sneakers, and other accessories for daily use. All her merchandise is sent by her daughter in big packages from another city. When she receives her order, she selects the articles that she will sell. Every day she goes out through the streets of the city seeking customers. She takes all her merchandise with her to offer it from house to house. Her sales method is cash or credit, and she collects payments daily, weekly, or every two weeks. On the other hand, when she doesn't manage to sell everything in the city, she travels to the population centers near the shores of the river. There she manages to sell everything and return to her house very happy, approximately 10 days after having left the city. She began this work two years ago, and sometimes she gets help from her son, who has a vehicle and helps her transport her merchandise. She feels very satisfied for the good that she is doing at this new stage. \r\n\r\nShe is happy to have this work because it gives her a lot of time during the hours when she is not working, since she can do her housework with great ease. In addition, she has learned to earn the respect and confidence of her customers, based on her good treatment [of them] and her great smile. She has good sales, and as a result of this she obtains good earnings. Now she hopes to continue growing and in the future acquire a sales stand to continue with her work. This is her tenth loan from MFP, for which she is grateful to those who make possible her financing to continue with her goals.

Sometimes she prepares desserts which she sells on the city streets to passers-by. She feels very happy because she knows that all the labor activities that she does generates the income that she needs to cover the basic expenses of her home; however, she knows that she has to continue to strive greatly in order to maintain this situation.

She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known from their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is originally from El Salvador and arrived in Maryland five years ago. In a difficult decision, she left behind her parents and her 13-year-old son to try to create a better future for the family in the United States. In El Salvador, Guadalupe worked in the accounting department of a coffee factory.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, after exploring different ideas for businesses, Guadalupe started Multienvios, a small business in Langley Park, Maryland. She sells cell phones, calling cards, remittances services and a variety of merchandise ranging from jewelry to clothing. She started the business with funds she had saved for two years, and the business is profitable.\r\n\r\nThis year, Guadalupe seized an opportunity to expand her business into Virginia. By subletting a small space in Falls Church, she was able to register the business and hire a new full-time employee to work at the store. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe's Kiva loan will be used to support her with funds to buy new inventory, including cell phones for the holiday season, for the Virginia store. Having been denied a traditional bank loan, the loan will also help Guadalupe strengthen her credit history in the United States.\r\n\r\nShe currently lives in Silver Spring with her partner and their new 8-month-old son, David.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2899.93,"image":{"id":1261249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeresita hopes to expand her business and dreams to have an organized and good life with her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is married to a wonderful woman by the name of Dilorom. Hasan is a kind and hard-working person. He works in a candy factory in his country's capital city. Hasan's wife lives in the country's north, and he is only able to visit her once every 3 months. Hasan would like to be able to live together with his wife, but is forced to work mostly in the capital after being unable to find suitable employment in his home city.\r\n\r\nHasan works very hard and does not lead a healthy lifestyle, with no one to cook for him or launder his clothes. Due to his difficult living conditions, his health has suffered and he has been unable to father children. Since Hasan and his wife would love to have children, he is requesting a loan of 2500 somoni for medical treatment. This loan will help to improve a good person's health. Hasan is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475.53,"image":{"id":1271430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

comparte la alegr\u00eda de educar a sus hijos e intentar brindarles una mejor calidad de vida.\n\nLa actividad de Guido, como todos los d\u00edas, es de conducir mototaxi, para eso sale a las calles de la ciudad en su veh\u00edculo en busca de sus eventuales pasajeros a quienes transporta dentro y fuera de la ciudad con bastante serenidad y tranquilidad ya que considera que la seguridad de sus pasajeros es lo m\u00e1s importante, de la misma manera siempre brinda su numero de celular para que pueda ser contactado por alg\u00fan cliente que necesita de su servicio de transporte o eventualmente como electricista, es as\u00ed que pasa sus d\u00edas entre las calles de la ciudad y las casas a las que acude cuando es requerido para realizar alg\u00fan servicio de electricidad, su experiencia y la calidad de su trabajo lo coloca como una pieza clave en ambos oficios que desarrolla.  Eventualmente brinda servicio log\u00edstico a empresas particulares.\nLleva realizando estas actividades por 16 a\u00f1os y aunque al principio no le fue muy bien ahora afirma que esa situaci\u00f3n a cambiado y sus ingresos se han visto multiplicados gracias a las recomendaciones de cada uno de los clientes para quien ya trabaj\u00f3. Ahora espera continuar trabajando y m\u00e1s adelante implementarse con m\u00e1s unidades de mototaxi para empezar a alquilarlos y generar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos con mayor comodidad. por tanto agradece a quienes hacen posible su cr\u00e9dito para continuar con sus objetivos, por otro lado est\u00e1 muy comprometido una vez m\u00e1s a cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas como lo hizo en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo, est\u00e1 muy contento de pertenecer a su banco comunal ya que todos sus integrantes son muy buenos, amables y solidarios.\nCon el monto solicitado (S\/. 1500), renovar\u00e1 el tapizado y algunos repuestos que su mototaxi necesita para estar en \u00f3ptimas condiciones.\n\n","en":"Guido, who is 47, is an honest and very friendly man who has always worked hard to provide the best living conditions for his family.  He is married to Narda, who is 39, and is the father of three children, Melina (16), Alexa (11) and Jos\u00e9 (5). They all live together in their own home which Guido was able to build as a result of his hard work and here, along with his wife, he shares the daily joy of raising their children and trying to give them a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nGuido runs a motorcycle taxi business and so, every day, he drives round the city streets in search of potential passengers whom he drives within and outside the city.  He conducts himself in quite a calm and tranquil way as he believes that his passengers' safety is the most important thing.  Similarly, he always gives his mobile phone number so that he can be contacted by any client who needs his taxi service or possibly also his skills as an electrician.  Consequently, he divides his days between the city streets and the houses where he goes when he is needed to do an electrical job.  His experience and the quality of his work have made him indispensable in both of the jobs he does.  He could also provide a logistics service for private companies.  He has been involved in these businesses for 16 years and, although things did not go so well for him in the early days, he says that the situation has now changed and his income has grown significantly thanks to personal recommendations from all the customers he has worked for.  \r\n\r\nHe now hopes to continue working and, in time, equip himself with more motorcycle taxis so that he can hire them out and generate an income in an easier way.  He is, therefore, grateful to those who, by making possible his loan, will allow him to pursue his goals.  Furthermore, he is once again very determined to make his repayments on time, as he did his previous loans.  He is very happy to belong to his communal bank because all its members are very kind, friendly and supportive.  With the sum requested (S\/. 1500), he will renew the motorcycle taxi\u2019s upholstery and buy the spare parts necessary to keep it in the best possible condition.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1271747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to renew the motorcycle taxi\u2019s upholstery and buy the spare parts necessary to keep it in the best possible condition.  \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T13:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T13:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guido ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":228.71},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":227.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":247.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":256.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":266.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.48},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.48,"local_amount":228.71,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":233.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573196,"comment":null},{"amount":90.88,"local_amount":227.18,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":231.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122843,"comment":null},{"amount":99.09,"local_amount":247.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":252.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868665,"comment":null},{"amount":102.79,"local_amount":256.98,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":262.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577501,"comment":null},{"amount":106.63,"local_amount":266.56,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":271.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529736,"comment":null},{"amount":109.13,"local_amount":272.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":278.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974768,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T16:53:33Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":514976,"name":"Milka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milka used her previous loan amount to purchase rice, sugar and maize meal for use in her restaurant.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nKaren operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors.

They live in a small village in the state of Manipur, one of the Seven North Eastern States, popularly known as the Seven Sisters. There is bus service from the main city, Imphal, and it takes about 3 hours' drive with a joyful bumpy ride.\r\n\r\nNempha is the profiled member, pictured with raised hand. She is 39 years old and is a mother to a son and a daughter who are in their teens. Other than farming and activities that result in daily wages, her husband does not have other means to earn income for the family. She grows vegetables in her homestead garden to maintain the family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 with her first loan she started a small grocery shop by her house for the family's main income. She sells potatoes, sugar, 'dal' (lentils), chillis, salt, cooking oil, hair oil, toothbrushes, spices and 'pulses'. With the sale proceeds she repaid her loan liability. She could not save much because most of the income was used for the children's education. With good faith, to stock her store afresh she was able to negotiate with the wholesaler from the town for the supply in partial payments. In this way she has been running her store and earning income for the family. Through her business now she is in a position to save INR 200 daily after meeting the family requirements. \r\n\r\nNempha needs another loan and this will be her second loan. She will use the loan to increase her store inventory that she will sell for a profit. She decided to expand to a department store for larger profit opportunities.

Members of the \"Blessing II\" group are very pleased to inform you that the previous loan they received from you has been very helpful in boosting their respective businesses. Each member of the group experienced vast improvements in their business. \n\nGroup leader Bintu, for example, has been able to build a six bedroom house out of the profit she makes from her business. She also pays school fees for her children out of the little profit she makes on a daily basis.\n\nHaving finished repaying that loan successfully, group members are again requesting a new loan, this time for 800,000 Leones for each. With the help of this new loan, their businesses will further improve both in size and quality. \n\nThe group leader, Bintu, will again use her share of the loan to buy cooking ingredients like rice, palm oil (the most popular cooking oil), tomatoes, Maggi (used to give sauce a sweet taste), onions, etc. in order to produce a larger quantity of cooked rice and sauce for sale.\n\n(Also included in

In 2006, when she first began her business, she sold only leather belts and traditional Mongolian fabric belts. In the beginning stages of her business, she rented a stall at the present market from another person who had a rental contract with the market. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time. At the time, her stall had 1 million MNT (Mongolian tugriks) in working capital. Usually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract with Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand. \r\n\r\nAt this time of year, it is the one of high shopping seasons, since it's the beginning of the Tsagaan Sar holiday. Odgerel wants to use this loan to help support her inventory in this very busy shopping season of the year. Odgerel's business goal is to one day operate her own clothing shop. Odgerel also said, \"It's my personal goal to support my mother and daughter so they can live happily.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2786.64,"image":{"id":1272180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Her husband will produce them and sell at a good price. Another part of the credit will be used for setting up a grain mill. Her mill will serve the local farmers and crush the grains.
