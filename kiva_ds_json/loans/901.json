Her husband is a construction laborer who also devotes his free time to help manage their rice-farming business.<p>\r\n\r\nPhlonh, who works hard and wants to attain more income in the future, is requesting a loan of KHR 400,000 to purchase a plowing machine for the maintenance of the rice field. Also, a portion of the funds will purchase feeds for fattening the pigs. She believes that this precious loan will result in a good return for the family, allowing her to continue her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1138411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a plowing machine for the maintenance of the rice field.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Siem Reap","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.366667 103.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2012-07-13T21:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-12T21:40:06Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phlonh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":204250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331155288,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-25T09:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":204250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355834782,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-13T21:58:28Z","paid_date":"2013-04-25T09:00:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449154,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma is 50 years old.

Besides transportation business, Sum's husband is going to get involved in trading firewood, but, due to the lack of capital, he will have difficulties to get access to this new business. To help her husband in the business and deal with the problems, Sum decided to look for a loan in the sum of USD 1,200 to purchase an additional horse and firewood stocks. Sum believes that, through the new business, the household will increase its income to satisfy her family needs. Also, she will save it for her children\u2019s education and future emergencies of the

She plans to invest her profits from this loan into her youngest son's business by buying livestock for him."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1136194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sarysogot village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-07-13T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-12T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aliyakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071193,"comment":null},{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631437,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-19T13:11:20Z","paid_date":"2013-07-19T08:43:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449155,"name":"El's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A local villager of the Ratanak Mondul district of Battambang province, El is a 32-year-old widower.

She will be able to sew and to sell to her customers. \r\n\r\nThe profits derived from this loan will enable her not only to buy her sewing supplies for expanding her business but also to meet certain needs of hers, as well as those of her small family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1138671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy 'pagne' cloth and sundry sewing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-07-13T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-12T23:20:05Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10336},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10729},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11123},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11516},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11910},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12303},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12697},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13090},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13484},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13877},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14271},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14664}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.03},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.18},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.67,"local_amount":10336,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11056.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308072014,"comment":null},{"amount":21.46,"local_amount":10729,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11477.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306414,"comment":null},{"amount":22.25,"local_amount":11123,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":11898.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914757,"comment":null},{"amount":23.03,"local_amount":11516,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12319,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047003,"comment":null},{"amount":23.82,"local_amount":11910,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":12740.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436797,"comment":null},{"amount":24.6,"local_amount":12303,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13160.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989214,"comment":null},{"amount":25.4,"local_amount":12697,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":13582.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622835,"comment":null},{"amount":26.18,"local_amount":13090,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":14002.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364436994,"comment":null},{"amount":112.59,"local_amount":56296,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":60221.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842069,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-14T04:01:25Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449193,"name":"Pilar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pilar is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a fishing business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 29,500 through NWTF to purchase additional fishing nets and other materials for her fishing business.\r\n\r\nPilar has been in this business for 11 years.

In her group she's known for making payments and being on time. She is the mother of two children, ages 14 and 6, and they live in their own home with her partner, Wagner. They've already had five happy years together. Every day Mar\u00eda pushes herself to get her family ahead in life and to give them the best. \r\n\r\nHer work consists of selling basic needs items and other goods for daily consumption. She has worked since she was eight years old, helping her mother who also worked at this business. However, since being on her own since age 14, she's had to keep working out of necessity to pay the bills. Since then she has generated her own income, and now she does it for the family she's created. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's small store is stocked directly by suppliers that come to her house with all their goods, which she puts in an order for. The one exception is fish, which she buys wholesale at the port in the city. The passing of years has taught her that the efforts of her hands leads to progress, and she knows it very well. Before she used to sell in the streets of the city; now she has a store in the main market of the city, and another, complementary space in her home. Through all that she has gained, she still has many dreams, and that's why she hopes that her business will keep growing. \r\n\r\nThe thing that she likes about her job is that she has time to do a lot of things from her home, and it's going well for her. Even though she says that in months like these commercial demand drops a little, it doesn't discourage her and she continues on. \r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's first loan with Micofinanzas Prisma. She hopes that it goes well, and that the members of her group give her the opportunity to join in to the rhythm of their work. She hopes that it won't be the first and last loan, but rather than she can keep working together for a long time. Already she thinks it's great that they're giving her a chance to be able to have a larger amount of capital for investment. \r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (600 PEN), she will buy groceries such as a sack of rice, a sack of sugar, a dozen bottles of oil, and a dozen of small cans of evaporated milk, which totals close to 400 PEN. At the same time, she will designate a portion - approximately 100 PEN daily - for the purchase of fish.

This is her first loan with MFP and she is very comfortable with the great support that they have offered her since she feels that in this way her economic progress and her family with continue to advance.  She is grateful for the solidarity that she has received from her group and for the orientation her advisor has awarded her.

Vive junto a ella y a su hermana en la casa que le construy\u00f3 su ex c\u00f3nyuge y lucha d\u00eda a d\u00eda para forjar su futuro.\n\nRachel tiene como principal actividad de negocio la venta de pescado. Todos los d\u00edas se levanta muy temprano para dirigirse al puerto pesquero de la ciudad para comprar los mejores pescados, frescos y de buen tama\u00f1o. Cuando los tiene, los selecciona por especie y por tama\u00f1o, determina un precio justo y los va acondicionado en una bandeja grande de pl\u00e1stico, luego inicia su recorrido a pie por las principales calles de la ciudad y va ofreciendo a viva voz lo que tiene para vender. Asegura que siempre camina muy contenta y con mucho optimismo. Lleva en esta actividad reci\u00e9n un a\u00f1o, trabaja siempre sola, lo hace durante toda la ma\u00f1ana mientras que su hermana cuida de su peque\u00f1a hija en su casa, funci\u00f3n que ella cumple por las tardes o en las noches. Afirma que algunas veces ha sentido que dar\u00eda marcha atr\u00e1s debido al intenso sol que la sofoca durante su constante caminar. Sin embargo, sabe que por ahora esa es su \u00fanica fuente de trabajo y quiere hacerlo crecer para obtener mayores ganancias, es por eso que ahora ha considerado la posibilidad de vender pl\u00e1tanos porque asegura que es el mejor complemento alimenticio para el pescado y adem\u00e1s porque sus propios clientes le solicitan tal producto, para ello solo necesita contar con el capital necesario y poner manos a la obra.\n\nEste es su primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, est\u00e1 muy tranquila por el gran apoyo que le est\u00e1n brindando, ya que siente que de esa forma su progreso familiar, econ\u00f3mico y personal puede emerger de manera segura. Del mismo modo, agradece por la solidaridad que ha recibido en su grupo y por toda la orientaci\u00f3n que le ha otorgado su asesor, eso la motiva a seguir esforz\u00e1ndose para cumplir con el pago puntual de todas sus cuotas. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo solicitado (S\/.500) lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de pescados y varios racimos de pl\u00e1tano.

She is characterized by her great friendliness and for the effort that she puts into the activities that she carries out in order to advance. She has a 7-year-old daughter named Jhoana. Unfortunately, she separated from her partner several years ago. It is for this reason that now she works hard to generate the necessary income to improve her quality of life for the benefit of her daughter. She lives with her and her sister in the house that her former partner built for her, and she strives every day to forge their future.\r\n\r\nRachel's principal business activity is selling fish. Every day she gets up very early to head for the city fishing port to buy the best fish, fresh and of good size. When she finds them, she selects them by species and by size, determines a fair price, and arranges them on a large plastic tray. Then she begins her route on foot through the main streets of the city, calling out to offer what she has to sell. She assures that she always walks very happily and with great optimism. She has had this business for just a year. She always works alone. She works all morning while her sister takes care of her young daughter at home, a role that she fills in the afternoons or nights. She confirms that sometimes she has felt that she would pull back because of the intense sun that suffocates her during her constant walking. Nevertheless, she knows that for now this is her only source of work, and she wants to make it grow to obtain better earnings. It is for this reason that she has now considered the possibility of selling bananas because she confirms that it is the best food complement for fish, and furthermore because her own clients ask her for such a product. To do this, she only needs to have the necessary capital and then get to work.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP. She is very pleased with the great support that they are offering her, since she feels that in this way her family, economic, and personal progress can emerge in a secure manner. In the same way, she is thankful for the support that she has received from her group and for all the counseling that her adviser has given her, which motivates her to continue striving to make all her payments on time.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan she is applying for (500 PEN) in the purchase of fish and a number of stalks of bananas. Her daily investment is about 100 PEN, depending on the market prices."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1134717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more fish and stalks of bananas to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T02:20:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rachel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":76.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85.47},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":91.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.46},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.41,"local_amount":76.03,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":80.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402066,"comment":null},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":79.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":84.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456342,"comment":null},{"amount":31.7,"local_amount":79.24,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452003,"comment":null},{"amount":34.19,"local_amount":85.47,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":90.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447177,"comment":null},{"amount":35.46,"local_amount":88.66,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":93.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053078,"comment":null},{"amount":36.42,"local_amount":91.05,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":96.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188015,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-14T14:42:27Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449214,"name":"Catalina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This time, for her 16th loan, Catalina is borrowing 21,000 PHP to buy stock for her general store.

is Maricar, 35, resident of Manila, Philippines. Her husband is Gary, a vendor, and she is a mother to her children.  She and her husband manage their household while operating their business.\r\n\r\nMaricar operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaricar hopes her business will expand and grow into a mini grocery through all her hard work. She also hopes to give her children a good education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1139390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":7499.97,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7854.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356186,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.03,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3490.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114284,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3491.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350333,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.93,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3490.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959501,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500.07,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2618.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094277,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-13T01:45:33Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:30:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449241,"name":"Elma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"49-year-old Elma is from the town of Baclayon, Bohol.

But in the last few weeks, she has seen the need to supply her business with hardware items, since her customers many times ask her for ropes, light bulbs, pipes, or keys that they need in their homes. She has had her little store for two years and works there with the help of her mother-in-law. Furthermore, she has also been working for seven months selling cosmetics, perfumes, and women's personal care and beauty accessories. She does this among her friends and people she knows. She sells on credit and make her collections in a reasonable period of time; in this way she recoups the necessary capital to restock her merchandise. What she likes is that she is earning what is necessary to cover the basic expenses of her household. It is going well for her, although really she wants to increase her income because she hopes to enlarge her business and have a better display of all the products that she offers.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the MFP institution. She knows that she can fulfill the requirements of the organization and of her group, being responsible and punctual with her payments. Thus far the members of her group have given her a congenial welcome and offered her the necessary confidence to continue being a good member.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the amount she has applied for (1000 PEN) in the purchase of five perfumes and five talcum powders, whose prices vary from 35 to 40 PEN each. She will also buy a sack of rice and a sack of sugar, whose average prices are 150 PEN each, along with other groceries. She will invest the remaining amount buying water troughs and food for chickens, her other business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1134719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":" to buy groceries to stock her store, as well as cosmetics to sell and food for chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T03:00:34Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T03:00:34Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":159.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":158.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":171.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":177.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":181.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.86,"local_amount":152.15,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":160.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402067,"comment":null},{"amount":63.68,"local_amount":159.19,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":168.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456343,"comment":null},{"amount":63.42,"local_amount":158.57,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":167.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452004,"comment":null},{"amount":68.42,"local_amount":171.03,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":180.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447178,"comment":null},{"amount":54.81,"local_amount":137.02,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":144.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053079,"comment":null},{"amount":88.81,"local_amount":222.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":234.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188016,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T22:21:49Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449243,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivic is 39 years old and married with five children.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Juliet is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and to maintain her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJuliet hopes her business will expand and grow into a mini grocery through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own house someday and to give her children a good education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her primary activity consists of the sale of desserts (jello, flan, custard and other sweets) at two schools in her neighborhood. This way, after a lot of walking and effort the day ends for Victoria, who afterwards begins to sell beauty products by catalogue, door to door in the homes of her neighbors in her community. Some of her customers also come to her home. She told us that she has many orders this month, so her working capital has decreased considerably, because she offers her products on credit.  \"Some pay me within 10 days, others within a month, because of this I have to pay the orders in advance to be able to deliver to my customers\", she said. She is a woman who works very hard and hopes to have the strength to continue working.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the collective group \"San Juan Bautista\" and this is her second loan with MFP. She ensures that with this funding she will improve her business, she is also grateful for the support that she receives from her association, that has many good people in it, which incentives progress.

She is currently engaged in a fishing business because her husband is a fisherman. She sells what her husband catches to the people in her community. They also do seaweed farming.  Seaweed farming is the practice of cultivating and harvesting seaweed. In its simplest form, it consists of the management of naturally found batches. In its most advanced form, it consists of fully controlling the life cycle of the algae.\r\n\r\nRestituta works very hard to support her family, especially for their three children ages 8,6 and 3.  Restituta is now requesting a loan worth 5000 PHP to buy a new fishing net and some of it will be used for the maintenance and repair of their fishing boat.

She lives in the city of Ica, in the district of Subtanjalla, with her small son who is 3 years old. She loves him and he is her reason to keep going. Sadly, for various reasons she is a single mother. She has always been a friendly, hardworking and enthusiast person who gives all of her strength to continue moving forward with her small child. Unfortunately, because of the necessity to work in order to afford her expenses, she is not able to pursue a professional degree, but she would have liked to have been able to do so.     \r\n\r\nBy her own initiative and with the support of her mother, three years ago Magdelena started a small business selling sunglasses and eyeglass frames. She sells in a market in her city. Magdalena likes the work that she does and believes that her business is doing well because her clients seek her out for her novelty items and good service.  \r\n\r\nMagdalena is very thankful for Kiva loans; thanks to the support provided she will be able to buy merchandise, like sunglasses and and different types of eyeglass frames.

In this way the grass is not overheated, nor too dry. She also takes advantage of her fields to sow grains in small quantities and sells them in the city. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Corazon de Jesus\" and this is her fifth loan with the MFP.

When she started the business it was very small and she only sold the most basic of supplies, like notebooks, pens and sheets of paper. Now she has a very well stocked business. She is thankful for the D-miro bank because it was the first financial institution that believed in her and in her business administration abilities, providing her with her first loan. Thanks to this loan she was able to open her business just outside the only school that is located in the area known as Sabana Grande and as a result of this her sales have increased noticably. The business is open from 7a.m., because it is at this hour that she sells the most, until 6p.m. She works in the store by herself, because her husband works as a day laborer in a estate. Her children are adults and live on their own, but come to visit. The loan that Irma is requesting is to buy bazaar items and paper supplies.

Teachers at this noble institution have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan of 3,000,000 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) for the entire group. With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will be able to improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nFifty-two-year-old Moiwai is the leader of this group of teachers. Moiwai was born in a place call Kamboma. He is married and has 5 children who attend secondary and tertiary institutions. Moiwai has been a teacher for 27 years. He has requested this loan in order to buy house-building materials: bags of cement, iron corrugated zincs, nails, robs, etc., for the construction of a family house. \r\n\r\nStaff from this school, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish on their salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in a business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

Teachers of this noble institution have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan of 4,500,000.00 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) for the entire group. With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will be able to improve on their standard of living. \r\n\r\nForty-five-year-old Nasiru is the leader of this group of teachers. Nasiru was born in Kenema. He is married and has 2 children who attend secondary and tertiary institutions. Nasiru has been a teacher for 10 years. He has requested this loan to buy house-building materials: bags of cement, iron corrugated zincs, nails, etc., for the construction of a family house. \r\n\r\nStaff from this school, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish tasks that they would otherwise not be able to do on their salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children, others can use the loan to buy furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in a business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1139635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy house-building materials: bags of cement, iron corrugated zincs, nails, etc., for the construction of a family house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasiru ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alpha I.\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel B.\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":210,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-22T08:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":917700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301950042,"comment":null},{"amount":210,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-20T08:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":917700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308848744,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":458850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315871392,"comment":null},{"amount":210,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":917700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331236745,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T12:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":458850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340104440,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":458850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347350022,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-21T09:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":458850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357089534,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-06T01:02:30Z","paid_date":"2013-04-21T09:14:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449440,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a teacher.

She lives in a small village in Gardabi District with her family: her husband, Elkhan, and their three children (12, 18 and 19 years old). The youngest child studies in the village school, and the elder children help their parents in the family business. The family earns their living through agricultural business. They have a plot of land, where various greens are grown. They sell greens on the local open market. Balakhanum and Elkhan also have 10 calves; they raise them and sell them after several months.\r\n\r\nBalakhanum and Elkhan requested a credit to expand their agricultural business. They plan to purchase sheep and raise them. They will sell them after several months for a higher price. They hope to receive a good profit.

In her home, Am\u00e9rica has a grocery store stocked with provisions where she sells rice, sugar, other staple goods, detergents, grains, and household products.  She inherited the store from her parents who taught her from a young age to do this work which she has always enjoyed.  Apart from this, she has always liked this work because she has control over her time and is also able to devote herself to the care of her children.\r\n\r\nThis business is something that she works at alone, without help, because it doesn't generate enough income to be able to afford another employee.

Her home is located in the annexed agriculturallands of Huaracayo, Tarma.\r\n\r\nFor the last 15 years she has been an independent woman.  Thanks to the land that she inherited from her parents, she produces peas, corn, potatoes, lettuce, and other vegetables.  She laso owns four cows, eight rams and small domestic animals like guinea pigs, which she raises and sells after a few months.  Yet the activity which she most enjoys is the sale of milk.  \"I have three cows that produce milk, and the business runs every day, so I never forget to feed and care for my animals,\" she says.  With these activities, she has successfully educated her only son, who helps her in her work in the fields, especially during the planting and cultivation of her crops.  She currently has three parcels of land planted in peas, which she thinks she will harvest in August.  Each parcel will produce at least 20 sacks of 60 kilos each.  One of her goals is to plant alfalfa to feed her animals and to sell to other ranchers.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, and therefore she feels certain to pay her monthly loans payments punctually.\r\n\r\nWith the money from her loan, she will be able to acquire alfalfa seeds to begin planting pasture land for the feeding of her animals"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1135342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds

The 3 live in their own house which they themselves constructed in the native community of Santa Teresa in the central forest.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago she began working in agriculture in the countryside. Rubi and Nino now have 6 plots of land assigned to them by the community.

In addition, she can count on a culture of saving that permits her to cover expenses all year. For his part, her husband works as a day laborer on other parcels of land, thus obtaining income to pay some of their inevitable expenses. Rubi has just finished the harvest and sale of the final grains of coffee. For this reason, she will begin cleaning the land and maintaining their plants. For that reason, she needs to purchase sacks of organic fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThis is her 2nd loan through MFP.

She is married, with two children. She is a college graduate. She works as director of a state agency in her district. Her salary is very low, which is why, in addition to her regular work, she also grows livestock by her house. She has been doing this for over 20 years. She has 17 heads of livestock. She is very knowledgeable in this area. Her husband helps her in his business. He sells livestock at the livestock market, since this is the family's main source of income. Husniya has been taking out loans with our organization since 2010. She never violated loan terms. She is  a very responsible, conscientious woman. She would like to use her credit to increase her livestock and expand her business.

Mrs. Fatoumata (seated on the far right raising her right hand) is a star borrower. She is 20 years old and married, without children. She manages a store in the village. With this loan, she will buy three bags of rice at 13,500 West African francs and a bag of sugar at 30,000 francs. The resale price of these products is 360 and 650 West African francs per kilogram, respectively. This new loan will allow her to purchase in high quantity and thus save on the cost of multiple trips. The revenues derived from her business will allow her to build up her savings, with the future goal of getting bigger loans, being able to better finance her business and  improving her life conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":1129586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy three bags of rice at 13,500 West African francs and a bag of sugar at 30,000 francs.
