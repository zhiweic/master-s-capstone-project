He solely depends on farming to earn a living and is therefore keen on practicing better farming methods.

Desde entonces ha sido la madre un apoyo incondicional junto a la hermanastra menor, para no desfallecer y que cada d\u00eda sea un nuevo comienzo con m\u00e9ritos hacia el \u00e9xito. \nA los 10 a\u00f1os Mar\u00eca Fernanda, en la mudanza de los dientes temporales a permanentes sufre un poco puesto que no fue algo convencional, los dientes eran m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os y tuvieron que colocar coronas poco est\u00e9ticas, generando  burla por un lapso dentro del colegio y familia; este suceso conlleva a un \u201csue\u00f1o\u201d, por el cual se est\u00e1 luchando continuamente, a tal punto de tomar la decisi\u00f3n de estudiar en el \u00e1rea de la salud, emprendiendo la carrera de odontolog\u00eda  con el fin de hacer personas felices, que pasaron por problemas, traumas de infancia como en alg\u00fan momento ella lo tuvo o simplemente por salud o apariencia sonr\u00edan con orgullo y le propaguen nuevo h\u00e1bito para la sociedad.\n\nEn el a\u00f1o 2009 culmina los estudios secundarios y en pro de su sue\u00f1o, se presenta a la Universidad, fallando en el intento, pero con esperanza ingresa a otra Universidad para empezar con su carrera profesional.

","en":"Mar\u00eda Fernanda is a very enterprising woman who works hard to accomplish her ideals. She grew up in a family composed of a mother who struggled with a lot of effort and dedication to always give her excellent principles and a good education at home as Mar\u00eda's father left her mother when he found out that she was pregnant. Since then, her mother has been of an unconditional support together with her younger stepsister, to not lose hope, and so that each day is a new beginning with all the virtues to achieving success.\r\n\r\nWhen Mar\u00eda Fernanda was 10 years old and her milk teeth were replaced with adult ones she suffered a bit as it wasn't something typical; her adult teeth were smaller and crowns that were not very aesthetic had to be put in place, making her the mockery of the school and family for a little while. This experience led to a \u2018dream\u2019, for which she is continually fighting. A dream to such an extent that she decided to pursue studies in healthcare, dentistry in particular, in order to make people happy, whether they had problems, childhood traumas as she had at one time, or simply for health or cosmetic reasons so that they could smile with pride and that they could have a new look in society.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mar\u00eda Fernanda completed her secondary school studies, and to make her dream a reality, she applied to university, failing on that attempt but with optimism she entered another university to start her professional career. At this university she studied up to the 5th semester, but once again her dream was interrupted, this time round for financial reasons. \r\n\r\nShe is a young woman who is proof of the compromise, perseverance and love for the dream that she had as a child, a dream that is now the profession and her greatest desire. She is sure that it is a vocation that is in her blood, hence why she has never tired and will continue to chase after the dream until she has made it a reality. It is for this reason that she decided to take a step back and resume her studies in the same branch but now from a technical aspect as she still does not have the financial stability with which to continue university studies.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Fernanda is currently studying at Campoalto, Oral Care, in the morning from Monday to Friday and due to the aforementioned financial instability she needs the support of Kiva, where she hopes to continue making firm steps to realizing her dream. As this is a step towards financial security that will enable her to finish her university studies, obtaining knowledge for the wellbeing of many, such as Mar\u00eda Fernanda, who look to smile at life despite the untimely difficulties presented along the way which are inherent to life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1505385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for a semester of enrollment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T15:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T15:10:19Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Fernanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T15:31:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641545,"name":"Kimhuoy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kimhuoy is 46 years old.

This way she will have more income and be able to raise her granddaughter.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1502425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase sheeting and wood to open a snack stand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T17:10:33Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T17:10:33Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":26.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":32.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":31.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":30.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":44.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":46.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":48.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":52.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":56.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":65.26},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":67.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":69.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":99.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.18},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653644,"name":"Aseda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aseda is 44 years old, married and has four children (two sons and two daughters).

old, married, and together with her husband is bringing up six children. Toktokan is a happy mother with many children. Three sons are working abroad in Russia and they send part of their salary every month to support the family. The remaining children are school age, and in their free time help Toktokan around the homestead. Her husband manufactures national musical instruments called \"komuz\" from wood. Very few people can manufacture such instruments and Toktokan's husband is among them. He makes komuzes on order and has a small income. <br \/><br \/>Toktokan has a high school education. As a main source of income for her family, Toktokan raises livestock, having started 13 years ago with a livestock purchase of 10,000 som KGS. Thanks to the hard work of Toktokan and her children, the homestead currently has: one heifer, five sheep, and ten goats. Also on the territory of the house, Toktokan has a small garden with apple and plum trees.

She feels very happy to be studying this profession because she has learned a lot in her rotations and she has encountered marvelous people who have taught her. \n\nHer family consists of three siblings, her mother and a nephew. She is the youngest. Her father died 12 years ago when she was only seven years old. She suffered greatly because of the loss of her father, but she overcame it with time. Her mother sacrificed a lot to raise them, because she played the role of father and mother during a very difficult stage of their growth. However, now she does not have the finanial means to pay for her semester of school. Today they are people who are very aware of their life goals, with projects in mind to now be the ones who are helping their mother. \n\nRosa is thankful to her mother for paying for her education and supporting her in what she likes, because that is what they need to advance as a family - to give each other advice and encouragement to complete their projects. However, now she lacks the financial resources to pay this semester. Rosa wants to be a good nurse, to be recognized at work, and to stand out for what she does and how she carries herself. One of her dreams is to get to know many countries and different cultures. She also wants to study English to go and work in the United States and have economic stability. \n\nNow that Rosa does not live with her mother, she has come to realize that it is not easy. Rosa was accustomed to seeing her mother every day, but being apart has made her stronger and made her appreciate her mother more. She is more dependent on her. Rosa believes that for some people it is worrisome that their mother does not live at the house, and they think it is because of household problems. However, this is not the case. Her mother wanted her children to be more responsible for their things and the house which their father left to them. Rosa has realized that to be responsible for the house is fantastic. She can say that she has the most wonderful family because they are very unified and more dependent on each other, and she has the loveliest mother who loves them and cares for them greatly, and she hopes that this will continue for many years more.\n\nWith her technical training, Rosa will have her future secured and the satisfaction that her time was not wasted but rather well used for her personal development. She wants to continue studying this area of health because she enjoys helping other people who need her care.

Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\r\n\r\nPius is 60 years old, married, and has five children.  He is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Pius has been a farmer for 20 years.  He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\r\n\r\nPius joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Pius joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, receive fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family and his send children to school.  Because he likes being a leader and an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Pius has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved his life because he has earned more profits from his harvest, has more farm training and farm group support, and is able to save money and  feed the family.  In the future, Pius hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, and buy a cow. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Pius and the Lukwa Group will use the loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and this loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1484217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Timothy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":187215,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187215}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641280,"name":"Rebeca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rebeca es clienta de Kubo Financiero y esta es su historia:\n\nRebeca tiene 25 a\u00f1os, es divorciada y tiene una hija.

She is studying to be a nurse\u2019s aide at Campo Alto; she\u2019s in her third semester.  She has already finished the theoretical portion on campus, and since December has been doing her practical training in a hospital.  This is a great opportunity, because she can be a big help and support to the patients while she goes on learning.  She chose this major because it is a lovely profession to try to help others recover and feel better just when they are going through a bad time of poor health.  In the hospital they give her the opportunity to do a lot of procedures.\n\nOne of the reasons she was motivated to study at Campo Alto was the chance they gave her to have an agreement in which she paid only a small portion of her monthly fees.  Unfortunately, the program ended and the costs are a little high for her to pay, because she doesn\u2019t have a consistent job and she has to pay the daily bus fares.  Because of this, she is asking Kiva to please give her support and allow her to belong to their program.  In this way she can keep studying and complete her dreams and goals to finish her nurse\u2019s aide program and begin the process to enter the police force.  This program is a great help because they teach you to survive every day and keep in mind that many people have problems that are worse than those that she could complain of, whether they are health problem or family problems.  She thinks it is a lovely profession because it teaches her more about life and gives her the strength to get ahead, regardless of the hurdles.\n\nShe is grateful to Campo Alto for giving her support and to Kiva for helping her with her major."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1505408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for a semester's registration fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer Corayma   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T20:58:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653729,"name":"Rosa Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa es una mujer de 38 a\u00f1os de edad es madre soltera vive junto a sus hijos en una casa arrendada en el sector llamado Ortu\u00f1o, perteneciente a la parroquia Pastocalle del cant\u00f3n Latacunga, perteneciente a la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador con el esfuerzo de  sus padres logr\u00f3 terminar la primaria  para luego dedicarse a trabajar ya que por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos se vio obligada a hacerlo para poder sustentar sus propios gastos , viven en  una ubicada en un sector rural de la provincia de Cotopaxi, su hogar es muy humilde pese a las grandes necesidades que han pasado son muy unidos entre cada miembro de la familia, Rosa cuida del sus hijos ya que el padre de ellos no ha sido responsable y Rosa ha sido padre y madre para ellos.\nSe dedica la venta ambulante de allullas, (un producto que se elabora de forma manual con ingredientes como: harina, huevos, mantequilla entre otros son horneados en le\u00f1a lo que hace que su sabor sea exquisito), cueros reventados y quesos de hoja que son alimentos t\u00edpicos de la zona de Latacunga estos productos los vende en la ciudad de Riobamba ella viaja todas las semanas y regresa a su casa cuando termine la venta, este negocio lo aprendi\u00f3 de unas amigas y hoy en d\u00eda es el sustento para su hogar.\nRosa solicita este cr\u00e9dito para mejoramiento de su vivienda lo cual servir\u00e1 para poder terminar su casa propia e irse a vivir ah\u00ed junto a sus hijos, con esto evitar\u00e1 pagar arriendo.

She is the mother of five children.  Two of them are adults who are more involved in different activities in the field with their father.  The third attends secondary school and the two younger children attend elementary school.  Her largest source of income is the cultivation of coffee but she also works cultivating basic staple foods (corn and beans) as well as raising and fattening pigs and chickens to sell in the community.  Sometimes she makes by-products for sale from both of these products such as pork or chicken tamales, in this way generating more income to support her children and the different necessities that arise.  Her coffee crops are located a distance of 1 kilometer from her house and the family goes there together to be able to attend to the plantation. \r\n\r\nHer plans are to continue cultivating more basic staple food products like corn and beans, especially in the summer season, implementing an irrigation system, by drip or butterfly valves, which will help with the growth, maintenance and development of the products.  As a mother she wants to see her children graduate and have good careers that help their personal and family development as the economic situation in their country is not the best. \r\n\r\nSo today Ceferina is requesting financial support for the purchase of agricultural supplies like fertilizers, manure and liquid fertilizers to spray on the leaves, among other things, to be able to attend to her coffee crops since this will give better protection to the seeds and better foliage to the plants.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1505453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase agricultural supplies to attend to her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceferina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":14500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T22:53:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641618,"name":"Jacinta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacinta is a married woman with four children.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 69 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Isaac is pictured on the right of the Bidii Group with his hand raised.\r\n\r\nIsaac is married and has 8 children. He is 46 years old and is known as friendly, reliable, hardworking, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group and prayer group. Isaac has been a farmer for 20 years. Isaac described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Isaac\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He first joined One Acre Fund in 2009 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed family and send his children to school. As an active member in his community, Isaac also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Isaac also joined One Acre Fund because they give inputs in time. He became a group leader because he is free when needed.\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r\nIsaac plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, more farm group support, and is able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nIsaac and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1483579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":369081,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T20:37:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653750,"name":"Emilia Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Emilia de 50 a\u00f1os de edad es viuda y habita en casa propia junto a su grupo familiar.

He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghm cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nKoki, 53 years old, is married and has 8 children. He is known as a hardworking, trustworthy and experienced farmer. He is active in community groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Koki has been a farmer for 18 years.

Koki has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Koki's life because he has more profits from his harvest and he was able to save money and to feed the family. In the future, Koki hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, to repair the home, to save for the future and to buy a cow and a goat.  \r\n\r\nKoki and the Mulembe Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.

The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMarachi, 34 years old,  is married and has 4 children. He is known as hardworking and trustworthy. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Marachi has been a farmer for 6 years. He describes his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nMarachi first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Marachi joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member. Marachi plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and to save for the future. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Marachi\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\r\n\r\nMarachi and the Lukova Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1484292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marachi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reuben ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zipporah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":240705,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240705}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653735,"name":"Aminata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 50-year-old Aminata from Waterloo 2, the western, rural area in Freetown.

She's married and the mother of two children who are in different grades in elementary school.\r\n\r\nLudy's a merchant because she earns a living selling chickens, guava, and basic grains.

Her customers are the grocery stores, neighbors, family members, friends, and eateries in the local area where she delivers her products weekly.  Only she, her husband, and her sister are involved.  The land where she keeps her chicken coop is her own, thanks to an inheritance from her parents; it's located 10 kilometers from the community where she lives and she gets there on an urban bus.\r\n\r\nAs a mother her goals are to support her children in their studies and give them the opportunity to go to college and become great professionals in life.

She is currently studying accounting. She chose this career because she sees a great beginning for her future because it is a career of great importance. Her dream is to finish her training to be an accounting assistant and then to pursue a path in college so that she can become an accountant when she finishes. She also would like to have her own business and continue scaling it up. She'd also like in the future to have a good job so that she can help her family with all of their expenses since her parents have paid for her education as well as the education of her two siblings. She would like to help her parents as they have helped her and pay for her degree herself. \r\n\r\nMarley is also currently studying in the eleventh grade. She is studying this specialty so that she can have several chances for getting a good job when she graduates so that she can continue paying for training. That will be helpful for her because she could have a good start at any job as an accountant.\r\n\r\nShe chose this degree because it seemed very appealing for the benefits she could obtain by getting better prepared in school. When she enters college, it will be less difficult for her to understand things. She says that knowing the many things she learns in school will make it easier to understand everything to graduate and fulfill her career goals. Also, when she enters college, she hopes it will go well so she can graduate and work for what she wants. \r\n\r\nShe would like to receive this Kiva loan because it is very necessary and also helps her parents since her father works independently and provides for her brother's studies. Her brother also began his career as a public accountant in college. His father does not have much income and Marley's sister is also studying in high school paid for by her father. Her mother is a homemaker and does not earn an income and, for this reason, Marley wants to carry out her work in this career as soon as possible to be able to help her family.\r\n\r\nThank you.

His job involved literally transforming barren fields into green space and he took what he learned to start a small urban farm in his backyard.  When his wife\u2019s job brought their family to San Diego, they chose to live in the rural countryside, allowing Hernan to take his farming venture to the next level.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe always wanted to be close to nature, raise our kids in nature, and be self-sufficient through growing our own food,\u201d shared Hernan. \u201cIt\u2019s empowering to be able to produce something and provide for others, instead of consuming without participation.\u201d\r\n\r\nHernan launched Solidarity Farms, growing all sorts of seasonal vegetables and selling fresh produce and eggs at the entrance of the farm.  He also participates in a community supported agriculture program in which his farm weekly delivers $25 boxes of produce to members of the program.  All this ultimately supports Hernan\u2019s vision of building a vibrant food system that primarily supports local producers.  Furthermore, Hernan is passionate about helping others consume whole and healthy foods.  \r\n\r\n\u201cI grew up watching my grandparents grow their food in their farm. They would not eat anything without knowing where it was coming from,\u201d shared Hernan. \u201cThey lived long lives, working well into their 70s. That childhood memory inspired my business.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the sole farmer on his farm, Hernan is always looking for ways to increase efficiency.  He recently expanded his property from 3\/4 of an acre to 5 acres and needs a tractor to help him scale up his operations.  He will use his $5,000 Kiva loan to purchase a tractor, allowing him to bring his business to the next level.\r\n\r\nHernan\u2019s dream is ultimately to build a thriving farm that produces healthy food for his community and educates others on the value of farming.  He shared, \u201cI want to awaken a passion in others to become farmers. What is more gratifying than healing people with food?\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the picture are Hernan, his wife Lisa, and their three

She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nShitawa is married and has four children. She is 35 years old, and is known as trustworthy.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group.  Shitawa has been a farmer for four years.  Shitawa described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\t\r\nShitawa joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Shitawa joined One Acre Fund so that she could get new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and send her children to school.  Because she wants to help more farmers, Shitawa has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and a Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Shitawa's life because she has more farm training. Shitawa hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school.  \r\n\r\nShitawa and the Amkeni Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low, and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1484174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":5200,"lender_count":156,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shitawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wanamgeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Risper","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":449316,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":449316}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-09T01:34:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641698,"name":"Mokhtar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mokhtar is a 35-year-old married woman.
