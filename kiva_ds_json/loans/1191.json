is a 35-year-old businesswoman who deals in selling second hand shoes in mobile markets.

The meagre income of the family is supplemented by Nengthem as well, by selling ginger and raising livestock.\r\n\r\nNengthem grows ginger on the hill slopes near the village. She also grows other vegetables, but her main produce is ginger. She also sells livestock in the village and nearby villages. The livestock are taken to the ginger fields in the morning, and they graze on the fields. They are brought back home in the evening when they are coming back from work. \r\n\r\nSince the lamb\u2019s main feed is grass, it is easier to raise them, as there is no extra expense on livestock feed. She can manage both the activities without much effort, and she also helps generate more income with selling ginger and livestock. With the present income, she could not afford to purchase more lambs, as the income is used for household expenses and other expenses. \r\n\r\nNengthem wants a loan to purchase three or more lambs. She will rear them in her field, and she can also work on her ginger farming without any disturbances. Once they are fully grown, then she can sell them. \r\n\r\nShe usually sells the ginger to the women vendors in the town market, as well to the vendors in the main market. She is glad that Kiva and WSDS are cooperating to develop the underserved women; she is trying to generate income for the family and herself to make a stand in the society.\r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS once again.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1405114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase three or more lambs, rear them, and sell them for profit when fully grown.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-17T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-16T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chongneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veineichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengthem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T14:47:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":594273,"name":"Robinah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robinah is married with four children and all her children go to school.

She is the mother of 2 children.  Both are too young and are fully dependent upon their mother.  Her husband owns a clothing business where he buys fabrics from wholesalers and sells them to retailers.  He has a lot of customers who like to buy fabrics from him.  Sometimes he purchases fabrics from outside of the city at low cost and sells them to retailers.  He has a good reputation in the market and his current customers refer his fabrics to other retailers, which creates advertisement.\r\n\r\nDue to new customers, the demand is increasing day by day.  However, he does not have sufficient funds to buy more fabrics.  Therefore, Shamshad requested a loan of 50,000 PKR from BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband could buy more fabrics to fulfill the demand.\r\n\r\nShe is in her 6th loan cycle and has shown excellent repayment behavior.  She has already been taking the loan from BRAC and investing in the business.  Shamshad hopes that the savings will increase and that she will be able to complete the remaining construction of her house. \r\n\r\nShamshad dreams for the bright future of her children, for the establishment of the business, and for a better living standard for her family.  She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1408190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is an honest and regular client of BRAC Pakistan, in her third loan cycle, with good repayment history.

not married, and has an adult daughter of the age of 21. After having lived in a civil marriage for 10 years, Irina was left alone. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, while looking for a source of income for her small family, Irina began selling men's and women's clothing at the market in the village of Kaindy, using 6000 som (KGS) as her starting capital. Since the trade was not very profitable, Irina sold off her inventory and from 2006 to 2007 worked as a saleswoman at a store. As her next step, Irina decided to lease a nearby shop that sells detergents, soaps, and cosmetics. Thanks to her tenacity, persistence, and daily work, Irina was able to develop her business, using the profits to buy an apartment in the village. \r\n\r\nIn order to broaden the assortment of goods, and also as she intends to purchase the space where she trades, Irina turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS). Irina plans to invest the income from the loan in arranging work for her daughter, who graduated from college of medicine this

She was born in a village which has good conditions for livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. Zebiniso's family had a low income, and since childhood she helped her parents with cattle breeding and field crop cultivation. \r\n\r\nAfter having finished high school, Zebiniso got married to a livestock breeder, and helped her husband with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. They mainly worked with livestock breeding, that is, they bought cattle at a low price at the market, fattened it for some time and resold it at a higher price. Due to unfavorable weather and climate, their business did not have positive results. Therefore, Zebiniso's husband went to the Russian Federation as a migrant worker. Zebiniso's family lived through this period only on the income from the livestock breeding. After this, Zebiniso started working with livestock breeding on her own. Zebiniso keeps cattle on fodder which she produces herself. For the income received from the business, Zebiniso would like to improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\nLast year (in December 2012), Zebiniso's husband returned from Russia, and for some time he helped his wife in managing the cattle breeding business. Currently, Zebiniso's husband wants to travel to Russia for work again. Therefore, Zebiniso turned to Kiva and its partner IMON with an aim to receive a loan to purchase plane tickets for her husband. She would like to continue her business of cattle breeding. Zebiniso hopes for your charity and mercy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1408104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To buy a plane ticket for her husband, who wants to go to Russia for work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-08-18T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-17T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zebiniso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":219.79,"local_amount":1014.41,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1047.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075946,"comment":null},{"amount":105.21,"local_amount":485.59,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":501.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989876,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T18:15:08Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:16:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596703,"name":"Ana Fabiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana tiene  48 a\u00f1os y vive en la ciudad de Nazca, es madre de 3 hijos de 20, 19 y 14 a\u00f1os a quienes quiere much\u00edsimo, sobre todo porque quiere brindarles una buena calidad de vida, mejor de las que ella tuvo de peque\u00f1a.

They have two daughters. Juan lives with his wife, daughters and granddaughter, who he loves very much. Together they live comfortably in their own home. Juan works buying and selling lumber. His business is located in a space he rents inside a lumberyard. Here he waits on his customers and converts lumber into pieces of parquet that he then sells at higher prices. He has worked at this business by himself for 20 years and is very happy with it because it provides him with a good income. He says that at first it was very difficult for him to do this work because of the intense competition that exists in this area.

Clotilde is a seamstress who creates new garments and also fixes flaws in clothing her clients bring to her, with perfect results. Clotilde has a small workshop in her home and has been working as a seamstress for 20 years, which has enabled her to feed her family for many years and also to obtain a good education for her children. She works alone and is very happy because the business is going well, although in certain seasons she has fewer clients. When Clotilde began this business, she experienced some problems, such as imprecise cuts in the fabric or choosing the wrong kind of fabric for a certain piece of clothing, but this was due to inexperience; as time passed and she gained skills in order to improve her work, she learned to overcome these setbacks. Today, she has a large clientele. At this time, Clotilde is applying for a loan of S\/. 500 and is very happy about the possibility of receiving this financial support, which help her feel confident about continuing to grow her business.

He is married and the father of 6 children. He has spent his whole life in the country, where he learned farm work and has done it for most of his productive life. His last job lasted 4 years. He worked as a farm laborer in flower cultivation, but a year ago he had the opportunity to become a partner in a farm and run it. He signed a contract in in which expenses, costs and profits are divided in equal parts. This has allowed him to generate the income he needs to support his home. He is a driven, enterprising, hardworking man. He says that his age is no barrier to do what he likes   and he has fought tirelessly to overcome obstacles that come along due to the high costs of agricultural materials. He has not had a constant cash flow because his customers pay him every three months. That is the reason he is asking for the help of the loan in order to invest it in paying for some monthly expenses (payroll, shipping, and utilities). These are expenses that can't wait and this way he can continue supporting his crop. Rodrigo dreams of having his own crop, whose earnings would allow him to continue paying his basic household expenses and enjoy and calm old age at his family's side.

She has four children (two daughters and two sons). She has an average education. After finishing middle school Aybubu married at a young age. She has been engaged in agriculture since 1993, mostly in livestock and arable farming, which she began with a 7,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni Loan. Her spouse and children are active and support the business. Her family is close and united. Thanks to her hard work and patient character, Aybubu currently has a good farm: two dairy cows, two calves, and ten sheep. Also she has 1.2 hectares of irrigated land on which she grows potatoes and perennial grasses. With profits Aybubu could breed livestock for the farm and improve her family's well-being. In order to develop her farm Aybubu asked the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 20,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni to buy calves. With the income from the loan Aybubu plans to further increase her number of livestock, and intends to finish the house in which she lives with her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1408188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy gobies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aral village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-19T02:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-18T02:40:01Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aybubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5203.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426993,"comment":null},{"amount":318.75,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":15611.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942560,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T13:11:28Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":594685,"name":"Salem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salem is 20 years old.

From a very young age, she expected to study for some type of degree related to health because she enjoyed helping others and felt like that was her calling.  In 2012, she graduated from high school but was not able to enter a degree plan in medicine because she did not have the necessary resources to continue.  Liszy then chose to study nursing and selected CampoAlto because it appeared to be a great place.  She was not able to enroll for the first semester because she did not have the money for registration or room and board.  In addition, she was not able to care for her 18-month-old daughter while studying.  This also explains why she is not able to work and does not have sufficient resources to pay for her degree.

She is married and has four children: 18, 14, 11, and 7 years of age.  They all study in school and are always asking their parents to repair their house, but the family\u2019s income from their cattle raising business isn\u2019t enough to do this.  Muhayo used to be very poor and didn\u2019t have a house.  There were times when she didn\u2019t have bread to feed her family.  Presently she has four cows and one sheep.  Their life is gradually improving.  Now Muhayo wants to improve the condition of their house.  She is requesting a loan of $3,000 (USD) to repair their home.

She is a very energetic and goal-oriented woman.  In her time off, she works around the house, takes care of their cattle, and, besides this, she and her family rent a plot of land from a farmer where they grow crops and feed for their cattle.  Salomat\u2019s salary is barely enough to live on.  Her husband is working in Russia and sometimes he cannot send money for months at a time, which makes it hard on Salomat.  \r\n\r\nThis year, Salomat\u2019s son graduated from the economics department of an institute in the Kyrgyz Republic.  The years when her son was in school were complicated for the family because most of their money went to his education and they had to be frugal with everything.  \r\n\r\nIn 2012, Salomat found out about a course for women that are put on by the Association of Business Women.  She took part in the course and started her own business.  Salomat bought a milk cow and a separator, and she and her daughter went in to business making and selling dairy products.  Not long ago, Salomat betrothed her daughter and the wedding will be at the end of this month.  However, the money her husband sends and her own savings aren\u2019t enough to cover all the expenses.  And so, having consulted with her family, Salomat applied for a loan of 5,000 somoni (TJS) to put on her daughter\u2019s wedding celebration.  She is relying on your kindness. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":188.93,"image":{"id":1408937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to throw a wedding party of her daughter ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-08-19T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-18T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salomat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":207.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":228.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":216.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":244.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":239.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":242.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":260.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":267.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":263.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":285.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":288.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":290},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":304.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":315.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":320.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":332.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":340.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":350.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.66,"local_amount":207.92,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":208.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410959518,"comment":null},{"amount":48.05,"local_amount":228.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":229.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075661,"comment":null},{"amount":45.7,"local_amount":217.6,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":217.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228322,"comment":null},{"amount":51.52,"local_amount":245.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":245.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989284,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T17:10:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":594714,"name":"Kideth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kideth is a 37-year-old married woman with three children living in Kasese, Uganda.

","en":"Aychurek is 54 years old, married, and has three children (one daughter and two sons). She has a vocational high school education, having graduated from the medical vocational school as a nurse. From 1981 to 1987 she worked as a nurse in a kindergarten. Since 2003 she has been a nurse at a OB-GYN clinic. Her colleagues describe her as responsible, goal oriented, and kind. Her husband and children help around the house. Her family is friendly, with good relations between all members. Her daughter is married and lives apart from the family. Her second son is working in Russia and sends money to his parents monthly to help them financially. The younger son works in a dairy factory. Aychurek has raised livestock and farmed since 1992 to provide an additional source of income for the family. She began the business with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work, Aychurek now owns a milk cow and 10 sheep, as well as 1.85 hectares of land where she grows beans. Her  farming activities bring her around 5,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk, which helps cover the family's living and food expenses. Income from the business allowed Aychurek to raise and provide for her children.

Thanks to a previous loan he installed a heating system and had a good harvest of early cucumbers and tomatoes. However, because of low prices Sergei didn't receive the income he expected. Sergei is now planting seeds for a second harvest. He is asking for a 10,000 hryvnia loan to buy seeds, fertilizer, and wood for heating. Thanks to the second planting he can harvest and sell vegetables until Christmas and thus earn additional income. Beside growing vegetables, Sergei and his wife also started a new business - selling groceries. They bought a kiosk, brought in goods, and are beginning to earn their first clients, as they sell both what they grew themselves in the greenhouses, and packaged groceries such as grains, sugar, tea, etc. "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":931265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his second crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-08-19T03:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-18T03:40:01Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergei","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.67,"local_amount":437.4,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":444.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874581,"comment":null},{"amount":1195.33,"local_amount":9562.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":9707.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440006053,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T08:36:54Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:25:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":593209,"name":"Bulus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bulus is a dedicated maize farmer and a Babban Gona member in Tsirya village in Kaduna.

","en":"Mahmayunus is a 26-year-old married young man who lives with his parents, his wife and two daughters in the Shahritus district. He has a university education. Mahmayunus is going to open a confectionery shop. He has rented a 3x4 meter shop in the central market area. His start-up capital is 3000 somons. Mahmayunus has requested a loan in the amount of 2,000 U.S. dollars.

Her monthly wage is approximately $180 which is hardly enough for food and everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nAccording to the government\u2019s estimate, the family belongs to the \"vulnerable poor\" category and gets small assistance (45 USD per month). As the living conditions are very poor, Ramaz decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions have rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Ramaz applied for a loan from MFO Credo. His request was approved within the framework of their Start Up program, a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $3000 will help Ramaz to purchase a secondhand car. He will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them in return for a service fee. \r\n\r\nRamaz is very enthusiastic and is a hard working person with a great desire to get ahead. This credit will be a great support for the family.
