Sometimes, it was very difficult for them to continue supporting her so, at a very young age, they decided to teach her the farming trade, an activity that she is still engaged in today to support her family.

Her earnings were a big help in her personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 40,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMaileen Rose dreams that her business will continue to grow and expand. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week.  It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

is 23 years old. He lives in Chiatura District with his parents. George has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGeorge is a dentist and he is working in a local clinic where he gets a small monthly salary. His father is retired and gets a pension. Also, his mother is an invalid and gets a small monthly payment from the government. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, George wants to rent a place to start a dental clinic locally. He will purchase all the needed dental equipment and operative supplies. George hopes his business will be profitable as he already has his clients from the current job. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will increase his income and his family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs, in order to improve their living

For the past 3 years, Irene has been working hard to manage her soft drinks business, which sells fresh juices. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Irene has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more soft drinks such as soda, water and passion juice to sell, and will help Irene to generate more income. She hopes that in the future she will be able to get more profits from the business. \r\n\r\nIrene is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The harvested product is sold locally at the market, and the family has a very small monthly income. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nZoia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Zoia will purchase cheese at wholesale prices and sell it locally at the market with a price mark-up.

Having repaid her last Kiva loan successfully, Sia is humbly requesting a new loan of 5,000,000 Sierra Leonean leones in order to further expand her business. Her first Kiva loan made a very huge impact in her business and personal well-being. She was able to make more sales, earn a better profit, and repay the loan. Sia also used the profit she made to buy a plot of land for the future construction of a house and a motor-bike taxi.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTanrikulu and his son work are artisans. They get orders to repair or to renovate buildings.  It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTanrikulu requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Tanrikulu will purchase all the needed equipment for an artisan, such as equipment for cutting stones, wood and walls. This will help him to work more productively and get more orders, which will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":439.94,"image":{"id":1307868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"for purchasing equipment needed for an artisan to repair buildings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gardabani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-09T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-08T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tanrikulu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":48.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":52.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":52.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":54.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":55.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":59.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":63.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.07,"local_amount":41.07,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":41.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570322,"comment":null},{"amount":45.68,"local_amount":45.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":45.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968956,"comment":null},{"amount":46.26,"local_amount":46.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":46.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749374,"comment":null},{"amount":48.12,"local_amount":48.12,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":48.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613280,"comment":null},{"amount":48.85,"local_amount":48.85,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":48.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857001,"comment":null},{"amount":50.18,"local_amount":50.18,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133659,"comment":null},{"amount":52.01,"local_amount":52.01,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:38:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107257,"comment":null},{"amount":52.98,"local_amount":52.98,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":52.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254828,"comment":null},{"amount":54.79,"local_amount":54.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":54.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440018993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T13:34:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":535500,"name":"Charlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charlita is 38 years old, married with two children.

He's married and has children.  His wife is a homemaker and is need to raise the children since they are still little.  Ilhomjon is a carpenter who has made furniture for a profession for the last 15 years.  He has many clients and has a good reputation among friends and relatives.  He loves his work and takes pride in it.  In his free time, Ilhomjon works with livestock, fattening animals to sell.  It's the furniture-making, however, that is his main source of income.  He dreams of buying a car since it is difficult and expensive to rent vehicles to carry logs and new tools.  With this goal in mind, he has turned to Arvand for a loan since he doesn't not have enough funds to buy the car outright.  He relies on the support of Arvand since purchasing the car will make it much more convenient to deliver orders and to buy raw materials for his

Her husband and two children (aged 11 and 7) help her with her work.  The growth of her business began by planting cucumbers in an open field.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings.

She works from 6.00 am to 8.00 pm daily and is able to make a small profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Tano's 3rd loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.

Her variety store is a winner in the village. People gather around the clock to buy things from her. Gambhini is very prudent with her daily expenses, so she has been able to save and restock with rice, sugar, vegetable oil, detergent soaps and detergent powder. Gambhini\u2019s only son, who is 17 years old, also helps her run the variety store when he is on vacation.\r\n\r\nGambhini joined the group savings and contributes monthly. She is delighted to share this because she used to admire the other group members who were in a position to have savings in the group whereas she was not. With the upcoming loan, she wishes to stock more supplies in the store and hire someone to run errands for the store. She plans on this because she believes that this will enable the villagers not to travel all the way to the marketplace for small items like salt, sugar, etc., which will eventually be to her benefit.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the other group members are also busy in their businesses and are working hard.

Lom Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tingbem is pictured with her hand raised and she is with the Mary Group. She has been running a paan shop in the village for the past eight years and earns extra income for the family by engaging in weaving. Life in her village gives fewer chances to Tingbem to earn and she finds it hard to refill her stock for paan-dukan due to lack of capital.  She sells essential commodities like peas, chili, sugar, onion, etc. In the day time, she is busy running her paan dukan and at night she weaves for additional income. Her woven products include traditional shawls, wraparound skirts, and scarves for women in general.  Tingbem takes orders and weaves accordingly. Tingbem plans to use this loan to refill her store's stock and buy more yarn for weaving. In the future, she wishes to expand her Paan Dukan into a General Store and own a shop in the market where she could sell her woven products in abundance. This loan will help her fulfill this dream.\r\n\r\nTingbem's husband is engaged in the construction of houses. His income depends entirely on the amount of work available. Thus, Tingbem hopes to get advanced carpentry tools for her husband when she is able to make a profit from the loan she avails. She wanted her husband to be independent in earning his own wages since he was working under the head construction workers.

Her tea stall did not accommodate a number of customers, so she took orders and served her customers by taking the tea and the toast\/puri to their respective stalls\/shops. Most of her customers are shop owners and vegetable vendors. Thus, these catering services are necessary for Veineineng's business success.\r\n\r\nBecause of her success, Veineineng bought a bench for her tea stall where she could accommodate her customers.  But her dream was shattered when her tea stall was demolished by the government in order to construct a new market shed. Starting all over again with a new tea stall would require a rented shop, for which she needed a security deposit. So, Veineineng considered taking up poultry because she had raised a few chickens before in her yard. She used to raise pigs as well.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan will support her plan and hopefully it will be accomplished. She feels the urge to run a poultry farm because Veineineng believes that she can do well in poultry and expand her business. By availing a loan, she will fulfill her purpose by purchasing more chicks and starting a poultry farm.\r\n \r\nThe other members of the group are engaged in weaving, selling used clothes, running a piggery, and running a paan-dukan.

lives in the Mombasa area of Coast Province, Kenya. She is a married business lady. She owns a retail shop--a business which she has been running for almost two years. She sells foodstuffs, household goods, etc.\r\n\r\nShe learned about Milango through friends who invited her to the group, and she joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations.
