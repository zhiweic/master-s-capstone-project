Abdurahmonjon worked in Russia for nearly two years. Nine months ago, he returned to his hometown, Yavan. He has a car, but he can't use it to make a living because it is broken. He needs $500 to repair it. For him, it is a huge amount of money, but he will have to repair the car to start earning. Therefore, he is asking for that loan amount. The only solution Abdurahmonjon sees to his unemployment is driving a taxi. He plans to carry passengers from the village of Yavan to the city of Dushanbe and back again. He will spend a lot of time on the road, but he likes this kind of work. The taxi will be Abdurahmonjon's only source of income. He is asking you to help! He is looking forward to your kindness and mercy!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":74.6,"image":{"id":1455444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"repair

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe opportunity to study at AUCA means the world to me. I have an ability to not only perform what is expected of me, but also to reach above and beyond the expectations.\r\n \r\nThe old Soviet education system proposed that getting quality education means only reading books and attending classes. Being followed by this habit, I was not involved in any extracurricular activities up until the 8th grade. That time I realized that it is not enough to become a competitive student and leader of the local community. \r\n\r\nIn the last 3 years, I have been devoting enough time to study sciences at school, as well as to my English and Russian language clubs and to leading the Issyk-Kul Volunteer Community. Since last summer, I also have been volunteering at a small newspaper called \u201cBalykchy\u201d as an independent journalist. Writing articles about social and economic events, featured stories, and sometimes poems, compose my jobs main responsibilities. \r\n\r\nAfter my participation in the \u201cYouth in the 21st century\u201d media camp, I found new interests: documentary photography and debates. Unfortunately, those are not available in Balykchy and many other small cities in Kyrgyzstan. Among all of my extracurricular activities, public service became the most beneficial to me as well as to the local community. Being a chairman of the community, I have learned to be more organized and independent, and communicate more efficiently with very different people. \r\n\r\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that AUCA gives another opportunity to all its students; a Kiva loan, which helps them cover their tuition fees. Taking this opportunity, I am also applying for the loan, so that I could cover my tuition fees.\u201d

They grow cocoa beans and corn every season of the year and they also grow rice, peanuts and vegetables in winter.  They need to irrigate their crops during the present season because of the drought this time of year and they have pumps available to carry water in pipes from the river that\u2019s not too far away to their crops.  This makes their work a little easier.

He is from the Zestaponi district in West Georgia.  He lives with his wife and grown son.  Nodar\u2019s wife works at the nursery school and earns a small monthly salary.  Nodar is a construction worker and he has recently returned from abroad, where he worked on house renovations.   At present, he is unemployed and seeking a job; but there is a high unemployment rate in the region among people over 40 and it has become hard for Nodar to find suitable work.  \r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that he has decided to start his own business.  He plans to begin trading food products but he needs a van in order to make deliveries.  With the loan, Nodar will pay for the van and start buying nuts as it is now harvest season and the prices are low.

Don Librado est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito a VisionFund y KIVA para comprar pl\u00e1sticos y pencas de nopales para su nuevo invernadero. \u00c9l cometo \u201cDesde hace ya mucho tiempo quer\u00eda tener un invernadero pero por falta de dinero era imposible, pero ahora el gobierno nos apoyar\u00e1 y con el cr\u00e9dito de la instituci\u00f3n comprare lo faltante\u201d. Apenas est\u00e1n instalando su invernadero. Don Librado platica las dificultades para obtener dicho invernadero: el gobierno les solicitaban varios tramites en el proyecto se encuentra su esposa Rosa (este grupo es independiente al grupo creado para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito a Kiva y VisionFund). Por varios meses estuvieron solicitando este apoyo finalmente el gobierno les dio una oportunidad de iniciar con su hortalizas. Don Librado ser\u00e1 pieza clave para sacar adelante este invernadero de nopales y verduras, trabajaron en conjuto para poder juntos obtener ganancias satisfactorias. Anteriormente Don Librado tenia una peque\u00f1a tienda de abarrotes sin embargo decidi\u00f3 cerrar el lugar porque sus ventas ya no eran como deseaba. Ahora ha despositado mucha fe en esta nueva aventura. Sin embargo, la preocupaci\u00f3n mas grande de Don librado es d\u00f3nde vender su producci\u00f3n; ser\u00e1 difil vender su verdura en los puestos o en otros negocios, pero esta consciente de esta situaci\u00f3n por lo que tendr\u00e1  que buscar clientes antes de iniciar a cosechar su verdura. La meta de Don Librado es poder llegar a comparar un terreno m\u00e1s grande donde pueda instalar otras hortalizas para poder competir con otros grandes empresarios \u201cMe dar\u00eda mucho gusto poder llegar a ser un proveedor en las grandes centrales de abasto, as\u00ed podr\u00eda yo mejorar la calidad de vida de mis ni\u00f1os\u201d.

Ellos est\u00e1n muy agradecidos con VisionFund y KIVA por el pr\u00e9stamo otorgado porque asi podr\u00e1n invertir en sus peque\u00f1os negocios.\n","en":"The Libra group is made up of five members: three women and two men. They live in the same community and they have a great friendship of many years. Librado is a very hardworking man, is 48, and has been in a common-law marriage for nine years. With his partner he has formed a family with two children who haven't started school yet. Librado is asking for a loan from VisionFund and Kiva in order to buy plastic and cactus pads for his new greenhouse.\n\nHe commented, \"For a long time I have wanted to have a greenhouse but without money it was impossible, but now the government will help us and with the loan from the institution I will buy what I need.\" His greenhouse is just now being installed. Librado talks about the difficulties of obtaining the greenhouse: the government required lots of paperwork.  His wife was part of that project (this group is independent of the group created to take out credit with Kiva and VisionFund). For many months they were applying for this help and finally the government gave them an opportunity to start with their vegetables.\n\nLibrado will be a key part of moving this cactus and vegetable greenhouse forward. They worked together to be able to obtain satisfactory earnings. Before, Librado had a small grocery store but decided to close the place because his sales weren't what he desired. Now he has put much faith in this new venture. Without doubt, Librado's biggest worry is where to sell his crops. It will be difficult to sell his vegetables in stalls or in other businesses. He is aware of this situation, therefore, he will have to look for customers before starting to harvest his vegetables.\n\nLibrado's goal is to be able to buy a larger plot of land where he can plant other vegetables to be able to compete with the other large businesses. \"I would really like it if I could become a provider in the large wholesale market. Thereby, I would be able to improve the quality of life of my children.\" The Libra group also includes Vero, who will invest in the sale of shoes by catalog, Gilberta who sells embroidery, Francisca who has a small grocery store and Felix who sells fried foods and snacks. They are very thankful for VisionFund and Kiva for the provided loan because with this, they will be able to invest in their small businesses.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1438872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy plastic and cactus pads.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Pablo Tlachichilpa, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Librado","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"J Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":12109.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991822,"comment":null},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6054.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644469,"comment":null},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6054.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877930,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T01:42:03Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":620923,"name":"Rhafinos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 27-year-old Rhafinos from Harare, meaning \"he who does not sleep,\" the capital of Zimbabwe.

The founders collectively have several decades of experience working in FMCG goods there. In launching a new company, they decided to sell small solar products due to the poor energy situation in Papua New Guinea. \r\n\r\nOnly 10% of PNG has energy access, which means that most people in rural areas rely on dangerous, polluting energy sources to light up their homes at night. Too often we read in the news about children injured by fire from a candle or a kerosene lamp. By reducing indoor air pollution, solar lighting improves health as well as safety. \r\n\r\nEnergy access in cities is also poor. Often there are long hours of the day when the power is out. People in cities need back-up lighting and power to continue basic tasks after sunset. \r\n\r\nOur plan is to set up a reliable distribution network throughout the country by tapping into well-established local businesses in each province who can share the benefits of Solar in their provinces and communities.\r\n\r\nA Kiva loan will enable us to scale up quickly so that we can reach more households with clean energy.\r\n\r\nPartnering with Barefoot will allow us to utilize the expertise that Barefoot Power has gained since its inception and put those learnings into practice. This will help us build a sustainable business supplying a much needed product, in a country that has less than 10% of its population connected to power and who are currently unable to benefit from having an affordable sustainable power source that will assist them in so many ways to develop.\r\n\r\nI have devoted 26 years of my working life to PNG and want to help this country develop so that my children and extended family, as well as the millions of other Papua New Guineans can look forward to a brighter future full of promise.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1452400,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2893,"youtubeId":"2B89j540CBk","title":"Kiva Borrower Mark Jonathan from Papua New Guinea","thumbnailImageId":1452400},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy and sell Barefoot Power's solar lighting products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PG","country":"Papua New Guinea","town":"Boroko","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-6 147","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":50000,"lender_count":1663,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mark Jonathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":50000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-26T00:24:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":620938,"name":"Augustina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Augustina's group is located on the outskirts of Teshie Township.

She shares a dream of a better life with 13 other women in the group. The ladies work in textile production, and most of them also grow flowers and other agricultural products as well as raising animals.\r\n\r\nAs Rosa and her family have been farmers for several years, she decided it would be advantageous for her to increase the amount of land she cultivates. She joined the Cielo Trust Bank and secured her first loan. Currently she is in her sixth loan cycle and is eager to receive her latest loan request of $512. She will use the funds to buy seeds and fertilizer for the onions, lettuce, carrots and broccoli that are produced on the farm. These vegetables are then sold to wholesalers in a large market located about one hour away. \r\n\r\nWhen the women involved in Friendship Bridge are asked about the future, they respond by saying they realize that education is the key to a better and more successful future. Rosa realizes how important it is in order for her children to live a more successful life. She knows they will learn to speak Spanish as well as her native dialect. Four of her children are currently in school, with two in high school on the weekends. In this way, the older children can work on the farm during the week.\r\n\r\nRosa and the other women of the Trust Bank Cielo are grateful for the support and trust of Kiva investors throughout the world. With a small loan and education, these hardworking ladies can sustain or grow their businesses, realize an increase in their earnings, empower themselves and eliminate poverty for their families and community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1038.51,"image":{"id":1451643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Llanos del Pinal, Quetzaltenango ","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T13:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T13:20:01Z","loan_amount":6225,"lender_count":232,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Venancia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia Clementa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cornelia Cipriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Roberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":49500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":6225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4129},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":519.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":519.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":519.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":513.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":519.25,"local_amount":4129,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4132.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503433,"comment":null},{"amount":519.26,"local_amount":4129,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728417,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T17:30:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621169,"name":"Lodinela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lodinela is 54 years old, married, and has four children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He leads by example and his farm is representative of his mission. He tries to avoid the use of agrochemical fertilizers and prefers the abundant manure produced by his cows to fertilize his crops. He is investing in a 25 cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester because he sees it as another tool to further his goal of reducing his negative impact on the environment. The biodigester will process the manure into methane-rich biogas, allowing him to displace the fossil-fuel based LP gas he currently uses to cook and heat bathwater.\r\n\r\nThis displacement coupled with the destruction of methane released by the animal waste will dramatically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by his farm.

Lizeth will thus continue working and striving to attain her great dream of becoming a good professional.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":105.33,"image":{"id":1456905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to buy a computer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lizeth Fiorela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":68.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":72.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":73.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":77.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":82.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":95.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":98.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":102.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.01,"local_amount":66.68,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":69.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819854,"comment":null},{"amount":52.59,"local_amount":140.23,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":146.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472786,"comment":null},{"amount":27.73,"local_amount":73.96,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":77.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695249,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T18:12:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":623610,"name":"Zenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Zenia es una mujer emprendedora y micro empresaria de su comunidad, cuenta con un peque\u00f1o local desde hace 6 a\u00f1os donde el producto que vende son derivados de la leche como ser mantequilla, cuajada, queso, tambien vende refrescos y ropa nueva.\nDo\u00f1a Zenia es madre soltera y gracias a este negocio a salido adelante, su negocio es muy visitado porque la calidad del producto que vende es de muy buena y sus precios son realmente bajos, ella solicita el apoyo del pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de queso, mantequilla, quesillo y huevos para surtir su negocio.\nDo\u00f1a Zenia para iniciar este negocio tuvo que solicitar pr\u00e9stamos a proveedores los cuales le dan a otro valor la mercader\u00eda y la ganancia era poca, sue\u00f1a con tener un local mejor surtido y tener productos nuevos para atender mejor a los cliente y poder vender m\u00e1s variedad, la foto muestra su negocio y a su esposo. \n\n\n\n\nDanl\u00ed, Honduras \u2013 Septiembre 2013 \n","en":"Zenia is an enterprising woman and a small businesswoman in her community.

She and her spouse have four children but only one of them is still dependent on her since the rest all have homes of their own and are independent people.  She did not complete primary school; she only finished 3rd grade because her parents\u2019 financial situation back then was very limited.  She\u2019s been growing coffee for more than 12 years having learned to do so from her family.  Today, in the company of her spouse she continues doing so on land  located behind their house they cultivate together and that they inherited from her parents.\r\n\r\nShe has asked Comixmul cooperative for financial assistance to be able to buy agricultural supplies to help her care for her coffee plants to protect them from the La Roya and La Broca fungi among other pests and illnesses that deteriorate the crop so that they can get good crop yields of attractive, good coffee beans.\r\n\r\nHer future plan is to be able to grow a better quality coffee that she can sell in the market and be competitive with to get ahead and someday export it as a quality product.  Her dream for her business and for her family is to get larger crop yields as stated previously and to complete her son\u2019s schooling so he can go all the way up to university level.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1456903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies for her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T17:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T17:30:18Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Berta Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T21:00:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622772,"name":"Mazharkhon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0430\u0437\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a. \u041e\u043d \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432 1967 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041c\u0430\u0437\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0430. \u041c\u0430\u0437\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 2 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0435. \u041c\u0430\u0437\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u0443 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0432 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u0441 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u043e\u043d \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 1100 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0435.

","en":"Atabek is 50 years old. He lives with his wife and children in the Gissar region and works as a baker. He specializes in traditional flatbreads. He bakes his breads in a small space, where there is a traditional round oven and an oversized table for rolling the dough. Atabek has been in this line of business for four years. Baking is a trade demanding a lot of focus, and Atabek concentrates all his efforts on work.
