Wangechi would like to use the loan to build a \"kibanda\" that would protect her business from this year's rainy season. She would also like to construct shelves to create more space for stock. Wangechi's goals for the future are to keep expanding this business and eventually to start a new one.

She took her first loan around a year ago. Receiving these loans has made it possible to invest in her small business. She produces candy with traditional preparations. She makes candies from peanuts, coconut and milk. She sells them door-to-door by walking in the streets. She will invest by purchasing milk, sugar, coconut, peanuts, cinnamon, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of Yolena's dreams is to have a beautiful house and a successful business.

It is noted that in the community where she lives, the community's quality of life is subsistence level, the majority are day laborers and some are independent business people who practice trade and raise domestic animals and some also involve themselves in agriculture. Mary lives in the neighborhood of Los Bances of the district of T\u00facume and department of Lambayeque, where there is only basic electrical service and the community water comes from an artesian well; here all the families around live under these same conditions.\r\n\r\nThe commercial activity practiced by Mary is the sales of traditional corn liquor (chicha de jora) and snacks, which she does from her home.  She is also involved in the growth and sales of pigs and poultry, and the raising of these animals happens in outdoor corrals on her land; it's worth emphasizing that Mary has 2 years of experience, which has allowed her to hold a steady customer base already established with her business. She sells her animals to the largest merchants in her area.  Her spouse also works in passenger transport, which allows them to have another source of income.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Mary has proposed expanding her inventory in regards to her snacks, corn liquor, and the growth and sales of animals, all because it is a very lucrative business in her area. It is for this reason that she is asking for a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of S\/.1000 Soles, which will be designated for investment in buying pots, serving spoons, colanders, and nutritionally balanced feed and corral repairs for her animals, which will, in time, allow her to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1087575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy materials for her business and to buy feed for animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"T\u00facume - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-13T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-12T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary July","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":76.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":78.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":82.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":87.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":90.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":92.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":98.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":69.95,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:26:08Z","rounded_local_amount":73.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332974,"comment":null},{"amount":28.1,"local_amount":70.25,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":74.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423786,"comment":null},{"amount":30.18,"local_amount":75.45,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":79.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317205,"comment":null},{"amount":30.42,"local_amount":76.05,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":80.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374024,"comment":null},{"amount":31.46,"local_amount":78.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":82.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385265,"comment":null},{"amount":251.86,"local_amount":629.65,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":664.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368860,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-17T21:09:47Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:18:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":425115,"name":"Benitta D.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benitta D. is 32 years old and lives in Sinkor.

They live in a rented house located in the district of San Ram\u00f3n - Chanchamayo. She sells clothes for a living, which she offers and sells house to house. She has been doing this for 3 years and considers it a profitable activity. \"Twice a month I travel to Lima (capital city) to purchase my merchandise\", she says. The products she sells the most are children clothes and polo shirts. Thanks to the direct contact with customers she has been able to span another type of business, which is the sale beauty products through catalogs, and she also does well in this activity; in addition to making a profit, she received awards because of the amount of sales she makes. She has been doing the latter activity for 7 months. One of her main problems is the lack of capital to purchase her products. \"That's why we are taking it slow, because I'd like to open a clothing store but there's no budget to do it\", she mentions as one of the goals she yearns for the most. This is the first time Sadita requests MFP for a loan, reason why she promises to be on time with her repayments. She belongs to \"Mujeres Trabajadoras\" communal bank and feels comfortable having supportive people as partners. She will invest the requested loan money in the purchase of clothes, and in order to get them she will travel to Lima city to buy the products at wholesale.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1087589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-13T18:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-12T18:00:13Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sadita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":88.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":129.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":136.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":144.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":150.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.52,"local_amount":88.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":93.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098809,"comment":null},{"amount":44.96,"local_amount":112.4,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":118.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401657,"comment":null},{"amount":46.15,"local_amount":115.37,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":121.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455940,"comment":null},{"amount":48.77,"local_amount":121.93,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":128.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451595,"comment":null},{"amount":51.97,"local_amount":129.92,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":137.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446776,"comment":null},{"amount":112.33,"local_amount":280.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":296.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052718,"comment":null},{"amount":60.3,"local_amount":150.75,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":159.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187827,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-11T19:16:30Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":425141,"name":"Ester","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ester is a resident and a farmer in the Kitale area of Western Kenya, where she lives with her family of ten children.

What she enjoys about her work are the constant trainings in beauty and health, which she shares with her customers. In the future she would like to open a clothes and cosmetics store in a stable place, to avoid walking too much. This is her first loan with MFP, which is why she commits to be on time with her monthly repayments. She belongs to \u201cLas Independientes - 2012\u201d communal bank and she feels happy to have supportive fellow members as partners. Giannina will invest the money she is requesting in the purchase of beauty products in order to sell them to the customers who have already put in orders.

She thinks that things will go well for her in her business because she sells attractive and novel products, and because she is very pleasant toward her clients.\r\n\r\nCarmen is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since it is thanks to the support that they have provided that she will be able to buy merchandise for Mother's Day, such as home decorations and clothing, among other things.

She asks for a 50% downpayment upon delivery, then gives credit for the remaining value of ordered products.  Each customer has a payment plan, with terms no greater than 30 days.  \r\n\r\nGradually, her orders have increased, especially during celebrations such as Mother's Day, which is approaching.  At home she always keeps a stock of the more popular products so that customers do not have to leave empty-handed.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the loan principal and the servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.\n

For the past 3 years, Madina has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Madina has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh foods for resale like sweet potatoes and raw matooke, and will help Madina to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Madina hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house on it. \r\n\r\nMadina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Madina's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

is 18 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Beatrice has been working hard to manage her production business, which sells dry food like beans and groundnuts. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Beatrice has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more beans and peanuts for sale and will help Beatrice to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Beatrice hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nBeatrice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Beatrice's future prospects by helping her to learn how to budget.

He sells them to shops, retailers and grocery stores of the area and he distributes them in a cart to neighbourhoods in the area. His goal is to make his business grow by buying whole harvests at a time, in order to become one of the major distributors in his district. The main challenges he faces are the seasonal nature of his trade and the fact that his working capital is not enough to meet growing demand. This is why he asks for a Kiva loan, which is his first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use the funds to buy avocadoes, pig meat, yam, fish, whey, cheese, and sapodilla plum. He is confident he will succeed because this investment will enable him to offer a wider range of products and thus be less dependent on the seasonal nature of his trade.

She is married to Nixon, who has worked as a security guard for six years.  Elsa has two \"little guys\", what she affectionately calls her sons.  One is 14 years old and attends high school.  The other is two years old and is looked after by Elsa.  \n\nHer business started three years ago when a friend recommended that she sells Yanbal products.  However, she prefers to sell L'Bel products since they tend to be more profitable.  Elsa works from 10am to 3pm.  She maintains this schedule so that she can be at home when her son returns from school.  Her main concern is dealing with robbers since she must carry merchandise with her as she travels from place to place in order to offer her products.  \n\nWith this loan, Elsa will buy merchandise such as makeup, perfumes, cr\u00e8mes, powders, and other items so that she can increase her sales and continue helping her husband with the finances.
