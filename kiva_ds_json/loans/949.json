He is married and raising one child, who is nine months old.  He grew up in a poor family.  His father worked at a collective farm, and mother stayed home and raised children.  Umidjon went to school until the ninth grade.  After completing ninth grade, he started working as a loader.  He started his own business in animal husbandry eight years ago.  He has a large garden, where he grows hay for the livestock.  He sells milk to his neighbors, who are very happy with the natural milk product.

She is a good, hard working woman. She has been married to Albertano for many years. She lives in her own home with her husband and her grand daughter who is 14 years old, to whom she provides for all her needs and tries to give her a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nMercedes has a business selling coal. She runs the business out of her home. She has a table set up where she puts the bags of coal, which previously she has portioned out into smaller bags. Initially she purchased wholesale, buying sacks that could make more than 50 small bags, which she then sold. She buys approximately 5 sacks a week, investing around 100 soles in each purchase. She has had this business for more than 4 years and it is going very well. Along with this business, she also sometimes sells local products like plantains and lemons. Her grand daughter helps her with the business, and also sometimes her husband. She likes her work because she is able to make her own income from the comfort of her own home, and also be able to do the chores that need to be done around the house. She has learned how to keep a balance between her business and taking care of the house. However, she is still not satisfied with her economic situation, which is why she wants to start a new business selling fruit. She already has a location to sell from, located in the downtown area of the city. She wants to sell the most tasty and delicious of the region and of the country, and in this way hopes to increase her income. This is the sixth loan she has taken out through MFP. She is thankful to the people who make these loans possible, which help her to reach her goals. She also said that she feels content with her community bank, because she knows the members and considers them to be responsible and supportive people.    \r\n\r\nWith the loan of 2000 soles, Mercedes will buy 5 sacks of coal and a few bunches of bananas to sell during this time, the rest of the loan she will invest in the purchase of various tropical fruits like grapes, apples, pears, custard apples, oranges, watermelons and others to start her new business with. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1193469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy 5 sacks of coal and various fruits.

Thanks to style and high quality of produced clothing, Susar was able to have regular customers from dance groups and music college.  In order to further develop her business, Susar requested a loan in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase materials for sewing.

He claims to be very responsible, thus potential lenders should feel at ease in case they lend to him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1194931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"buy fabric to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AL","country":"Albania","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 20","type":"point"}},"partner_id":239,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T20:40:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T20:40:28Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hekri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ALL","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4900},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4600},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4600},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5200},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5200},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5300},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5400},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5600},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5700},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6100},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6300},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.1},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.95,"local_amount":5400,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5402.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288037,"comment":null},{"amount":342.25,"local_amount":37000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":37017.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323117787,"comment":null},{"amount":74,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8003.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347195987,"comment":null},{"amount":77.7,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8403.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364657427,"comment":null},{"amount":84.18,"local_amount":9100,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":9104.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381836412,"comment":null},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":8600,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8604,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390694534,"comment":null},{"amount":157.25,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":17007.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399940714,"comment":null},{"amount":60.12,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":6503.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419987718,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-26T14:55:25Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T21:32:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":472549,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is 45 years old and  lives in Kakata with her husband and four children.

He has eight children in total, seven of whom have their own employment whilst the remaining one daughter is a student. He has been in business for 10 years, earning about 31,000 KHR per day and saving about 10,500 KHR per day after offsetting daily expenses. \r\n\r\nThis is Hut's fifth loan cycle with VisionFund, Kiva's partner. He has smartly used his previous loans with success in order to obtain better living conditions for his family. Now, he is joining a group consisting of three members to take out a new loan. Hut, as group leader, is going to use his loan portion to pay  plowing fees and some part of it to buy a small boat to support his fish-catching business. He hopes this loan will enable him to double his income and expand his business so that he can upgrade his

started her partnership with our organization in 2011.  She sews \"kurpachi\" or national mattresses at home.  Her mother taught her this business, and now Rahbar continues it herself and helps her mother to make \"kurpachi.\"  Rahbar also works as a waitress at a restaurant.  She tries to earn more because her children grew up, and she needs to get ready for them to start a university and save money for her son's and daughter's weddings.  Rahbar has four children, and her husband works hard as well.  She wants to obtain this loan to purchase cotton in order to make national mattresses.

He can work approximately 12 hours a day and believes that he is doing well because of his dedication and the friendly service he gives his customers.\r\n\r\nNixon is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to the help they have given him, he was able to purchase tools for his workshop, such as screws, wrenches and jacks, among others. Consequently, Nixon will have his business better equipped and will have the tools at hand that he needs to do his work. Thus, he plans to expand his services and increase his earnings, which will insure that in the not too distant future, he will be able to have his own shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1193478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase tools for his mechanic's workshop.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

is 42 years old.

With her profits from farming, Pelagie wishes to invest in her business so that in the future, she can acquire machines such as tractors to enhance her farming capacity. This photo was taken recently at a maize farming plantation. Pelagie was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both her family's needs and her business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

is an 18-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nFortune was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nFortune is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nFortune comes from Mutare, Zimbabwe and is one of a family of eight. Growing up in Zimbabwe, Fortune was surrounded by high levels of unemployment. He recognised early on that unemployment was a major challenge to the economic and social development of his country. It is Fortune\u2019s long-term goal to bring about change to address this pressing social issue.\n\nFortune identified and addressed a need in his community when he noticed the unpleasant surroundings of the local hospital near his boarding school. Fortune felt the need to improve the area as it had become a breeding ground for mosquitos and snakes. He appealed to his fellow classmates to help the hospital personnel tidy up the surroundings of the hospital. He managed to mobilize a group of students to pick up papers and cut the long grass around the hospital \u2013 efforts that were recognized by the nurse in charge of the hospital.   This is now an on-going project.\n\nA natural leader, Fortune has held multiple leadership positions. In Zimbabwe, leadership roles he assumed included: Sports Commissioner (co-ordinating sporting activities at his school), a junior leader at his church, the chairman for Kutama Cricket Fund-Raising Committee, and  duty-boy at his school (waking up earlier than the others to ensure that everyone woke up on time and issuing cleaning materials for students who needed to use them). In addition to the numerous leadership positions he held, Fortune was still able to excel academically and was even named the best student in Economics in his high school in Zimbabwe. \u201cA good leader needs to manage their time well,\u201d says Fortune.\n\nAn aspiring businessman, Fortune\u2019s entrepreneurial flair was recognised by pan-African bank, Ecobank, when he submitted a business plan to the bank for a business competition. Ecobank praised Fortune for his entrepreneurial ability and acknowledged that they were interested in supporting his plan so that he could execute it in the future.\n\nIn twenty years\u2019 time, Fortune sees himself as a large-scale social entrepreneur in Africa. He wants to build businesses that provide services that will seek to address the problems that the continent will be facing at that time.  He wants to partner with other people who are passionate about developing the continent to maximize the impact of their work and contributions to the continent. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1199520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":" to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortune","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748408,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735291,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614224,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-20T01:18:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":475042,"name":"Sinesipho","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sinesipho is an 18-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nShe was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nSinesipho is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nSinesipho is from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and her leadership journey began when she was very young.

Despite the hardships she has suffered, Sinesipho was able to use her experience to positively impact the lives of others.

She says that she wants to impact Africa by telling untold stories and giving people a voice through her journalism. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1199527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sinesipho","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748409,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735292,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614225,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T23:32:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471647,"name":"Rafael Ernesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rafael Ernesto de cincuenta y siete a\u00f1os de edad  vive junto a su compa\u00f1era de vida y sus hijos en casa propia; \u00e9l se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol desde hace treinta y siete a\u00f1os, el tiempo de trabajo le ha regalado mucha experiencia que le permite obtener las mejores cosechas, el terreno de cultivo esta ubicado en una zona de alta incidencia agr\u00edcola y muy cercano a la localidad donde reside, comercia en todos los alrededores de la localidad y se ha hecho de mucha clientela que lo prefiere porque todo lo que vende es de primera calidad, a precios accesibles pero sobre todo con un excelente servicio; Rafael es un hombre emprendedor con muchas ganas de salir adelante, siempre esta buscando alternativas que le abran camino al \u00e9xito, se dedica al m\u00e1ximo a su labor porque sabe que solo as\u00ed alcanzara el \u00e9xito; en la ultima temporada de siembra tuvo mucha perdida por eso en esta cosecha quiere recuperarse, pero para ello necesita de capital que lo respalde por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar semilla de ma\u00edz, frijol, abono, insecticida, etc. Rafael Ernesto tiene buenas referencias de pago asegura que podr\u00e1 saldar la deuda y a la vez tiene fe que ofrecer\u00e1 darle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida","en":"\r\nRafael Ernesto, 57, lives with his life companion and their children in a house of his own.

Sadly, she\u2019s a single mother.  She\u2019s a very kind, hardworking, enthusiastic woman who focuses all her efforts into moving her family forward.

She heads out to her place of work very early every morning to start work.  She might work up to 12 hours daily and believes she does well because of the good way she carries out her duties and because of the kind way she treats others.\r\n\r\nFiorella is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support provided her she will be able to build a room.  To do so, she will buy supplies like adobe, cement, sugarcane stalks, sand and others.  In this way, Fiorella will have a room to live in with her little girl and she hopes this way to provide better security and wellbeing for her family and she can continue working and striving so that she and her family can get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1193588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

From the above two businesses, her family earns a monthly income of 6,000 Indian rupees (INR) per month. Due to low income, in spite of her concerns, Jyotsna was unable to construct a toilet for her family. So, by investing the present loan of 20,000 INR, Jyotsna is planning to construct a toilet for her house to get rid of outside defecation which results in health hazards.

Chunchi tiene clima fr\u00edo que acompa\u00f1ado de lluvias frecuentes y un nutrido suelo, favorece la agricultura en este sector. Tiene varios lugares naturales como cascadas, lagos, p\u00e1ramos que son considerados lugares tur\u00edsticos que son visitados con cierta frecuencia y aportan al desarrollo de esta ciudad. Se presentan porcentajes de analfabetismo que superan el 20% y el 78% de pobreza por lo que a muchos en la poblaci\u00f3n se les dificulta acceder a algunos servicios b\u00e1sicos. \nA pesar de estos antecedentes, hay personas que no se han dado por vencidas frente a los obst\u00e1culos de la falta de educaci\u00f3n, como es el caso de Luis quien alcanz\u00f3 apenas a terminar la primaria, pero a sus quince a\u00f1os ya aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres el oficio de criar cerdos para luego comercializarlos. Con ocho horas diarias combinadas tambi\u00e9n con actividades de agricultura, Luis espera mejorar su estilo de vida, para lo cual necesita obtener un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar cerdos, arreglar los criaderos y posteriormente comercializarlos en un precio competitivo. ","en":"Luis is a young single man of 25 who lives in Chunchi, a village located in the province of Chimborazo, Ecuador. Chunchi has a cool climate with frequent rains and a fertile soil, encouraging agriculture in the area. It has a number of natural wonders like waterfalls and lakes, which are considered tourist attractions that are visited with a certain frequency and support the area's development. More than 20 percent of the population is illiterate and 78 percent is in poverty, so much of the population has difficulty accessing basic services. Despite these setbacks, there are people who don't back down in the face of the obstacles presented by a lack of education. Such is the case with Luis, who barely finished primary school but at age 15 learned the trade of raising pigs to sell from his parents. With eight hours a day combined with agricultural activities, Luis hopes to improve his quality of life. He is requesting the loan to purchase pigs and fix his pens, so he can later sell the pigs at a competitive

Rasmita, a 24-year-old lady, lives with her husband, a daughter (age 3), father-in-law and mother-in-law. Rasmita makes and sells leaf plates to add some income to her family with the financial support of Mahashakti. She purchases sal leaves (one type of forest leaves) from the tribal peoples, then stitches leaf plates and sells to the wholesaler in the same village. Her husband sells silver utensils moving from village to village. He does this business from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. Although Rasmita is managing her family with the limited income from these two businesses, her family is facing lots of problems due to the lack of essential facilities like a toilet. \r\n\r\nIn rural India, including rural Odisha, 80% of diseases happen due to the use of polluted water. The data say only 7% of rural areas are covered by toilet facilities in Odisha and the national figure is only 22%. Rasmita says, after her marriage when she came to her husband\u2019s house, there was no toilet in their house. She faced many complicated and embarrassing situations due to outside defecation. In the rainy season, the situation is most horrible. So she is determined to provide a toilet facility for her family members and wants to construct a toilet by taking out a loan of 20,000 Indian rupees in two phases. By doing this, she feels that it will be a solace to her father-in-law and mother-in-law who are very old.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1194915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to pay for the construction of a toilet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-20T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-20T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rasmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-20T11:03:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":472040,"name":"Vilma Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vilma Isabel de 20 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposo, dos hijos y su padre de avanzada edad.

Because of her previous experiences inspecting mismanaged facilities and organizations, Oletta has always emphasized safety, educational enrichment and fair pricing to better service the low-income families in her community.  \r\n\r\nNow, eleven years after opening her first day care center in her grandmother\u2019s house, her self-determined, entrepreneurial, \u201cno excuses\u201d mentality continues to drive her to better her facility and the lives of the children she spends every day loving and serving. Oletta will use her Kiva loan to make upgrades to her center, as well as purchase computers and reading material for the children. These upgrades will allow her to attract more clients and further enrich the lives of the children she loves.

has always loved orchids. Originally from Japan, Machiko grew up with the Japanese practice of cultivating intricately designed and beautifully cultivated orchid plants. Although orchids are very common in Japan, they are unaffordable to most. However, during a visit to Hawaii over 30 years ago, she was surprised at how accessible orchids were and how easy they were to grow in Hawaii. It was during this time that she first began raising and cultivating orchids with the dream of sharing the beauty of Japanese orchids with everyone she met.\r\n\r\nAfter moving to the US, Machiko refined her orchid planting and cultivating skills. Orchids are among the most difficult flowers to grow and require the perfect balance of water, sun and nutrients to flower. The way Machiko tenderly cares for her orchids demonstrates not only her passion for her craft, but also her expertise in what she does.\r\n\r\nReady to expand her business and sell more orchids, Machiko will use her Kiva loan to build a shade for her plants, increase her planting area and also buy more flowers. She hopes to grow a larger, more beautiful orchid garden to attract more business and inspire people to fall in love with the flower she has loved all these years.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1632.34,"image":{"id":1191049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Her daughter helps her by selling snacks, such as pastries, tostadas, cassava, etc. and her grandchildren sell popsicles, sodas and chocobananos (frozen chocolate-covered bananas on a stick) from door to door to residents in the community. Do\u00f1a Mabel in turn is responsible for running the store she has in her house. She has more than 25 years experience in selling fast food, such as sandwiches, hamburgers, pupusas and hot dogs. The store is her most recent business. She purchases all the products she needs in the city every eight days to keep her store stocked, or every four days if the demand is greater.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy four 100 lb sacks of rice, four 100 lb. sacks of beans, a 100 lb. bag of sugar, 25 cartons of eggs and cooking oil, among other items, as well as to pay off a debt that her daughter has with another lender. Her mother used to run the store, however she became ill and the store declined. Consequently Mabel hopes that with the loan she will be able to strengthen the business and obtain a stable income for her family. Her goal is to buy clothing, as well, to sell right there in the store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1192636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase four 100 lb sacks of rice, four 100 lb. sacks of beans, a 100 lb. bag of sugar, 25 cartons of eggs and cooking oil, among other items, as well as to pay off a debt that her daughter has with another lender.

To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 1981, having started this business with a sum of 7,000 som.  Thanks to Kumush's hard work, today her business contains three dairy cows with offspring, ten sheep, six goats and six horses, and the monthly income amounts to 10,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Kumush requested a loan in the amount of 90,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy young livestock for fattening up and resale.

To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 1982, having started this business with a purchase of sheep.

years old.  To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 2000, having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som.

Juana has 17 years of experience in business activity out of her home and on rounds.\r\n\r\nHer daily routine is to get up at 5:00 am to open the shop from a very early hour--to take advantage and sell as her clients have to get up and find breakfast to send their children to class--until 10:00 pm. She started the business with savings from her job as a teacher, from which she had to retire due to illness, and so decided to start her own business.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this loan is to invest in clothing for women, men and children, and some orders for her clients. \r\n\r\nPaula is married and has six children, all of age and independent.

The rest of her family lives in a rural area of the Moung Russey district of Battambang province. To overcome the family's hardship, Khun has been growing rice on five hectares of farmland for 30 years. Her main challenge is the drought which lowers her crop production. \r\n\r\nKhun's group consists of two female members. She and her fellow group member are in the second loan cycle. The past loan, which she has paid back, has made a better living for her family especially in keeping her children in school.

lives in Malindi area of Coast province, Kenya. She is married and has five children, four of whom are in school. She owns a grocery store which she has been operating for three years. In this business, Zawadi sells greens, flour, cooking oil etc.\r\nZawadi learnt about Milango through a friend, with the aim of accessing credit to improve the business operations.

The other members, Lucila and Maria del Rosario, both live in a place called General Sandino.\r\nLucila was interviewed this time.  She is a housewife.  She is married to Rosendo, and they have three daughters who are her responsibility.  They are in elementary school and high school.\r\n\r\nShe devotes herself to her business activity in order to support her husband, whom she married very young.  She works to be able to get income for her household.  Her parents did not support them with anything to start their married life.  \r\n\r\nThat is why they decided to start working with coffee, corn, and bean crops.  She thanks God that the crops went well for them.  Years later her father decided to support her, and he gave them a little money, which they invested in raising pigs to later sell live.\r\n\r\nWhat she wishes from her business activity is to continue working on her land harvesting corn and beans.  She wants this in order to save the income she will be getting and to support her children who are in school.  She wants them to make something of themselves.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1185502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for purchasing and selling coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-20T20:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-20T20:20:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maxima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1182.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1248.23},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1296.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1363.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1421.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1487.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.38,"local_amount":1182.45,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1199.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407703,"comment":null},{"amount":97.52,"local_amount":1248.23,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1266.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392137,"comment":null},{"amount":101.28,"local_amount":1296.46,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120000,"comment":null},{"amount":106.55,"local_amount":1363.74,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1383.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068048,"comment":null},{"amount":113.41,"local_amount":1451.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1473.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284795,"comment":null},{"amount":113.86,"local_amount":1457.46,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1479.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199120,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-21T11:34:51Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":472981,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Due to hardship, Elizabeth and her husband hope to earn sufficient income to satisfy their needs.

She says that they gave their group that name because that's what they call their community; they decided to name the group after their community so that they wouldn't forget the name.\r\n\r\nAlicia has been with the group for several cycles. She says that although she has had various problems\u2014in the last cycle, two of her fellow members fell behind on their payments\u2014she is continuing with the group because she knows that they are very responsible, they are people who really invest their loans in their businesses and are able to pay back their loans, and they mutually support one another.\r\n\r\nAlicia says that she and her husband have a business that makes cinder blocks and bricks and sells gravel and sand. She says that she started this business with her husband more than seven years ago because her husband was working in construction in another country; when he arrived in Mexico, they decided to start their own business and provide for their family that way. She says that they have special machines for making cinder blocks or bricks, which they sell by the thousand for construction. They also sell loads of gravel or sand or whatever their customer orders. She says that she likes their business because it pays well and because she can be available to her children since the business is run from their house. She says that she is requesting a loan from the lender to purchase cement, sand, and gravel, and to repair some of the machines that they use to make cinder blocks and bricks.

This is a very hard-working community and one of the top producers of poinsettias in the nation. Over six million flowers are produced every year. They are sold within the country and exported abroad, since there are several colors such as red, coral, white, and brown, and varieties like Prestige, Oreon Red, Maren, Marble Star, Monet, and Free White. This currently generates 624 permanent jobs and 328 seasonal jobs, 60% of which are for women.

He started his business two years ago with his old car and serves about 13-16 people a day. This is his family's main source of income. He lives with his wife and children in the ger district, an area of city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. The roof of his house is in bad condition and has been damaged for a long time. He has repaired it many times, but unfortunately it is broken again. In the winter, there is too much heat loss through the bad roof. He uses a coal-fired furnace to get his house warm and keep it that way.

Her dream is to make improvements to her house with services like installing a brick floor and potable water, to help her son with his schooling and to stay in business for a long time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1195055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy shirts, underwear and socks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2012-09-20T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-20T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna Noemy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":375,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":27.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":28.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":29.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":30.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.48,"local_amount":25.48,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308478375,"comment":null},{"amount":26.6,"local_amount":26.6,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":26.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315683069,"comment":null},{"amount":28.86,"local_amount":28.86,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":28.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323084908,"comment":null},{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":30.21,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-24T10:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332917560,"comment":null},{"amount":26.54,"local_amount":26.54,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T12:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":26.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339607493,"comment":null},{"amount":30.63,"local_amount":30.63,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":30.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356561305,"comment":null},{"amount":66.12,"local_amount":66.12,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":66.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364615736,"comment":null},{"amount":140.56,"local_amount":140.56,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":140.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373196020,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T18:30:25Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:43:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":473018,"name":"Oyundari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Oyundari, 37, makes the Mongolian national furniture and appliances at home with her husband.

Bayaraa, 35, is an electrician and he has been doing this job since 2003 nonstop. He lives with his wife and his two children in her old house, which is located in the ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads, and spotty electricity. They live in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. \r\n\r\nHis house has some problems such as heat loss and damage to its roof, inside walls, etc. So he is planning to make repairs and insulation using rock wool, cement, and foam. As he thinks, his home will be warmer after the wall, roof insulation, and a new smart furnace are installed. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution.\r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems, and to buy the cars that run on natural gas.
