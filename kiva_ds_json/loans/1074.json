She loves them all dearly and they provide her main reason for living.  She is a very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who, like her husband, devotes all her efforts to providing for their family.  Unfortunately, due to lack of financial resources and because she had to work from a very early age, Clara was not able to study.  She would, however, have loved to study for a professional cookery qualification.  In her free time, she likes to stroll with her family around the welcoming and sun-drenched streets of her city.   Acting on her own initiative, and with tremendous effort and commitment, Clara works in her small shop where she sells groceries and drinks.   She works daily for between 9 and 12 hours and believes that she does well on account of her good prices and the friendly way in which she serves her customers.  Clara is very grateful to Kiva lenders, whose help enables her to buy merchandise, such as rice, sugar, beans, oil, sweets and soft drinks, amongst other things.  This means that Clara will keep her shop better stocked and cater for her customers and, as a result, will be able to continue working and striving to realise her great ambition of providing a good education for her children and seeing them become successful

She has raised six children. Ainur's children are grown up, and she lives with her son who helps his mother in the household. Ainur has fourteen grandchildren. \r\n\r\nIn search of a source of funding for her family, Ainur started her business of livestock breeding already in 1990, in the period of the collapse of the Soviet Union, after having used a starting sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Successfully working within the sphere of livestock breeding and field crop cultivation has given very good results. Ainur also grows fodder, which lets her provide fodder for her livestock and gives and additional income from the sale. Ainur grows potatoes on her field too, next to the fodder. She owns 3.0 hectares of land and three heads of cattle. The family has up to 15,000 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nTo further develop her business, Ainur turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of potato seeds and fodder seeds. Ainur plans to improve her business through the income from the loan. Ainur shared with us that she plans to give her grandchild an education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1062.5,"image":{"id":1305967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds for potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Burma-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-11T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-10T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainur","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50587.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426829,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T22:48:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":536101,"name":"Angelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelina is 60 years old and married with seven children. \r\n\r\nAngelina is in the agricultural business.

","en":"A happy father, loving husband, breadwinner and good teacher, Mengnikul was born in a remote town outside of Kishlak. Even during his childhood he wanted to become a teacher. At that time, he walked sheep and cows with his father. He counted, multiplied, and divided out the livestock. Hence, his childhood games and rhymes turned into a profession. Mengnikul was able to realize his dream and become a teacher. \r\n\r\nMengnikul has eight children. He would not have been able to survive and provide for them with only a teacher's salary. So, he had to start raising cows for extra income. He says, \"If it weren't for this occupation and the suitable location, my family would have starved and I would not have survived that.\" To his good fortune, he received a loan from MDO \"Arvand\" a few years ago. By using the loan wisely, he was able to escape the endless circle of problems and the matter gradually worked itself out. \r\n\r\nMengnikul now has a few heads of cattle, but he needs one more cow and additional sources of income to purchase feed. His children have grown and as the years go by he needs to increase his income. He really wants his children to enroll in university after high school so that they will have a bright future. With such intentions in mind, Mengnikul again turned to MDO \"Arvand\" for a loan to purchase livestock. He hopes that MDO \"Arvand\" will help him again during a difficult moment so that he can realize his current plans. As a teacher, he knows what hard work means. Mengnikul never forgets about his students and teaches them well. You could say that he is a role model for his students and children.

Despite his age, he has already managed to create his own small farm. He has about 25 sheep and seven cows. He has 17 years of experience in animal husbandry. He is married and has five children. Animal husbandry is his main source of income. His cows and sheep provide his family not only with milk, but also with their \"daily bread\". \r\n\r\nHabibulo takes his profession very seriously. He spends a large portion of his time in the pasture where he takes his sheep to graze. He has big plans for the future. He wants to build a home and send his son to the city to study. However, his financial circumstances don't allow him to bring his dreams and plans to fruition. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, last year an unfortunate event occurred - some of his sheep died due to flooding and disease. Habibulo pulled himself together and continued on with his work. His wife helped him a lot. She milked the cow, sold the milk, and did the shopping with the income they earned. Now Habibulo is saving and being economical. As the father of five children, he tries to ensure that his family does not go hungry. \r\n\r\nUpon finding out about loans, Habibulo turned to MDO \"Advand\". He would like a loan to purchase livestock and livestock feed at the right moment. He hopes that Arvand will support and help him to recover from his loss. Habibulo, his children, and his wife thank you in advance for your help and understanding.

She is a mother of 2 young daughters with whom she lives in her own house together with her husband of many years. Roc\u00edo sells candy and pastries for a living from the door of her home. Additionally she has various rooms in her home which she rents to have more income. She has been in the pastry business for more than 10 years and does it with the help of her children. The window works for the sale of sweets, which was followed by snow cones, but the climate in the zone is very changing and that does not help for the successful completion of sales. As a business woman she is already seeing the way of being able to generate income with another type of investment. What she likes about her job is that it provides good income and she is able to be at home with her children.

They are thankful that the land is their own, which gives them a little more income.\r\n\r\nRight now, she is requesting assistance for the purchase of fertilizer, manure and insecticide spray for the cultivation of coffee since they want to better maintain their crops and prevent the spread of pests and diseases such as plant rust that can destroy an entire crop if contaminated.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that their crops are the most productive so they can obtain a better income from coffee so they can get their children ahead with professional degrees so they can be better every day as young entrepreneurs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1310131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer, manure, insecticide spray for coffee growing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-03-11T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-10T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":14500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T13:11:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":536441,"name":"Jessy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jessy is a 20-year old recent high-school graduate who lives with her family in the Chongwe district of Zambia, about 45 miles east of Lusaka.

He lives with his wife and two children in his house.  Alexei is a hardworking, calm, steady person and a good farmer.\r\n\r\nIn this area, growing vegetables in greenhouses is the main type of business for many and in the summer there is a lot of competition.  Alexei installed heating in his greenhouses in order to get an earlier harvest and to start selling earlier.  \r\n\r\nRecently Alexei bought a plot of land nearby and decided to build two greenhouses there.  He built one but does not have enough personal funds for the other.  Alexei is asking for a loan of 24,000 hryvnia.\r\n\r\nAlexei has expansion plans.  He plans to build two more greenhouses and install heating there.  Then he would like to purchase more land for expansion.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":1308943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to build a new greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-03-11T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-10T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":2975,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexei","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1487.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1487.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1487.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-27T08:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":12100.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589780,"comment":null},{"amount":1487.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12100.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399834154,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T16:28:13Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T13:21:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":536170,"name":"Ma.

However, due to a lack of capital she hasn't been able to stock her business very well and she doesn't have a lot of corn to make tortillas, which is the product that gets her the most profit.

Shazia is hopeful that this loan will be a productive one for her husband and will bring positive changes to his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":181.89,"image":{"id":1309667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy new tires for her husband's vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Mandi Bhauddin","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-03-11T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-10T20:50:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shazia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1415},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1457},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1499},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1588},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1635},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1683},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1732},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1834},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1888},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1944}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.92,"local_amount":1415,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355848555,"comment":null},{"amount":16.39,"local_amount":1457,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1602.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364557323,"comment":null},{"amount":16.86,"local_amount":1499,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1648.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372955823,"comment":null},{"amount":17.36,"local_amount":1543,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1696.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381735546,"comment":null},{"amount":17.87,"local_amount":1588,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1746.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390822704,"comment":null},{"amount":18.39,"local_amount":1635,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1798.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399843037,"comment":null},{"amount":38.42,"local_amount":3415,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3755.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419883095,"comment":null},{"amount":20.05,"local_amount":1782,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1959.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429531705,"comment":null},{"amount":20.63,"local_amount":1834,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2017.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439755523,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T09:12:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":536233,"name":"Virgeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virgeta is 40 years old and married with three children who are all in school.

is 34 years old. He is married and lives with his wife and two children who go to school in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia. Several times, Kakhaber requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nKakhaber works as a builder at private company and gets a small income, which is not stable. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nKakhaber requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

cas\u00f3 con V\u00edctor que ahora tiene 54 a\u00f1os y es jornalero en algunas fincas de la zona. De este matrimonio nacieron 3 hijos a quienes nunca les falt\u00f3 nada y fueron educados bajo principios y valores \u00e9ticos que los ayudar\u00eda a defenderse honestamente frente a la sociedad. Ahora ya son independientes y cada uno tiene su familia. Kety vive con su esposo  en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, un lugar hist\u00f3rico de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, provincia de Ecuador con un alto crecimiento sostenido y cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. \nKety siempre estuvo dedicada a atender a sus hijos y a su esposo en el hogar, sin embargo, ahora que viven la \u00e9poca del \u201cnido vac\u00edo\u201d en donde ya los hijos han salido del hogar; Kety decidi\u00f3 dedicarse a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo para ocupar su tiempo ayudando a su esposo con el gasto del hogar. Kety recorre las largas calles de su ciudad ofreciendo sus productos a sus clientes y tambi\u00e9n cobrando las ventas de los productos ya entregados, tambi\u00e9n recibe a muchos de ellos en su domicilio, quienes van en busca de productos en stock para solucionar necesidades inmediatas. Es por esto que Kety cree que es indispensable aumentar su oferta de productos en stock para que as\u00ed aparte de obtener mejores precios por parte de sus proveedores, tambi\u00e9n pueda ofrecer a sus clientes todos los productos que ellos demanden de manera inmediata y de esta forma sus ingresos puedan mejorar para llevar un mejor estilo de vida con su esposo.

Cuando le contamos a Kety sobre la metodolog\u00eda para obtener el financiamiento para su negocio, ella sonri\u00f3 y les agradece por la confianza que depositen en ella, pues en un futuro ella se ve con un local adecuado y amplio donde se comercialice productos cosm\u00e9ticos y de belleza para todas las edades y todo se dar\u00e1 gracias al financiamiento que cada vez ella pueda obtener.","en":"Kety is a 43 year old woman who was born in Chone. When she was young she moved to another city where she married Victor, who is now 54 years old and works as a day laborer for various farms in the area. Together they have three children who never wanted for anything and were educated with principles and ethical values that help them to honestly stand on their own in society. Nowadays they are all grown and independent and have families of their own. Kety lives with her husband in the R\u00edo Verde Parrish, a historical district of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, in Ecuador. The region boasts a sustained and high level of growth and strong trade because it has become a trade hub for commercial land routes between the mountain and coastal regions of the country. \r\n\r\nKety was always dedicated to caring for her children and her husband at home, but, now that they have entered an \u201cempty nesters\u201d phase in which her children are out of the house, Kety decided to begin selling catalogue cosmetic goods to keep her busy and to help her husband with the household expenses. Kety travels the long streets of her city offering her products to her customers and collecting on sales for products already delivered. She also receives many customers in her home, who come in search of products they need immediately. For this reason, Kety believes it is very important for her to expand her inventory of available products because then she will obtain better prices from her suppliers and she will also be able to offer her customers all of the products they seek on short notice. This way she will improve her income and be able to provide for a better life with her husband. \r\n\r\nEighteen months ago this enterprising woman was introduced to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa through strong references from colleagues and friends, and when she interviewed with her credit advisor it gave her the confidence to make this institution an important part of her working life. Now Kety is applying for a loan through Kiva in order to purchase various products to increase her inventory. When we discussed with Kety the method for obtaining financing for her business she smiled and expressed her gratitude for the confidence that our institution put in her. In the future she will have her own store where she will sell cosmetics and beauty supplies for people of all ages, and all this will be possible thanks to the financing she will be able to receive.

A year ago she started selling clothing to her friends and neighbours. She notes that when she started out, it was difficult as she had no customers and she didn\u2019t know if she could earn a profit. However, even though it was a difficult time, she did manage to find customers and gradually her customer base grew.\r\n\r\nEven today she continues to sell from door to door, and sometimes her customers seek her out to make special orders, or when there is a fiesta, they want to buy something simple from her to give as a present. Marisela says, \u201cI have had lots of good experiences from selling, and I have made good friends, but it has also taught me that I cannot trust everyone. Some people don\u2019t want to pay you and I lose money.\u201d\r\n\r\nA loan through VisionFund will give Marisela the opportunity to buy shirts, blouses, socks, skirts, pants, dresses, shorts, and underwear.\r\n\r\nShe is 43 years old, didn\u2019t go to school, is married to Epifano, and has two children.

In particular, they have a vineyard, a plot of land where 400 nut trees are grown and a milk cow. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Nino will rent a place to open a plastic shop. She plans to purchase stock of plastic dishes to sell in her shop. Nino will work as a saleslady and will do her best to increase the income of the family.

She lives in her own house and now lives with only her grandson, who is her principal motivation to continue advancing. Pilar's work is buying and selling wood of various types. She sells wood to her customers on request or by coordinating with them. She mainly works with the species that are most requested, such as bola\u00edna, cedar, capirona, and catahua, which are the best lumber species at a good price. She has been in this work for one year. She works with the support of her daughter and her son-in-law, who help her in placing the wood in other cities. She learned to do this work a little while ago, since in the past she sold chickens, but she decided to change to the forestry sector because she thought that she would receive better earnings in it. She likes her work, since it gives her time to do other activities in her home.

She has been working in retail for six years after learning the trade from her mother, who also worked in retail and used to give Karen merchandise to sell. Once she was ready to work on her own, Karen got a loan which she used to buy merchandise, and, little by little, she formed her own clientele who now maintain her business. She uses the income she earns to contribute towards household expenses. She mainly sells women\u2019s clothing, comforters, towels, and underwear to her customers who pay her on credit. Her working day begins at 9 a.m. and ends at 4 p.m., after which she concentrates on the housework.

is 37 years old.  He is married and lives in the Baghdati District with his wife, two infant sons, and parents.  Irakli requested a loan from the local financial institutions several times for a family start-up business, but without any success.  His loan requests were always rejected due to low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities.  In particular, they have 3 milk cows, a pig, and a vineyard.  They sell cheese products and wine locally.  It is hardly enough to provide food for the family.  According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrakli\u2019s loan request to Credo was approved in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages the provision of credits with soft conditions to country rural poor.

He lives with his wife and three children in their house.  The oldest son is 14 years old, the middle is 11, and they both attend a school; the youngest daughter is 5 months old.  The wife and older children help Sergei with the work.  They primarily grow tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes.  A large greenhouse fell this year due to snow.

born in the city of Kapan and lives together with her husband and daughter in the Getishen village of the Syunik district.  Her son is working in the Russian Federation and often helps his family in Armenia.  Karine is 47 years old.  She has been involved in agriculture for almost 20 years.  She and her husband have land in the Getishen village, bees, cattle and rabbits.  Karine sells the agricultural products, which her family works hard to produce, in the cities of Kapan and Kadjaran.  She has acquaintances, friends and family, who help her with selling agricultural products because they have stores in Kapan and Kadjaran.  Karine has been diligently involved in beekeeping the last few years.  She read a lot of literature about bees and researched how to correctly care for them in order to obtain quality and ecologically-clean honey.  As Karine confessed, one has to first love bees and have a lot of patience to get a good result.  Karine needs a loan in the amount of 700,000 Armenian dram to purchase bees and hives to develop her beekeeping

Kapan of the Siyunik district.  She studied to become an economist at the Kapan construction college.  Liana got married at an early age.  Liana is now 37 years old and a widow; her husband died in a car accident.  Liana has a son, who lives with her along with her parents.  Liana's mother is ill, and father teaches at the Kapan construction college.  Because Liana is raising her son by herself, she does everything to make sure that he grows up to be a deserving citizen of his country, obtains good education and lives happily and without difficulties.  After her husband's death, Liana opened her own business and has been selling food products, clothing and dishware in a leased store in Kapan for almost four years.  Once a month, she buys merchandise at wholesale markets in Yerevan and resells it at her store in Kapan.  She already has many customers, who prefer to buy clothing, dishware and kitchen accessories from Liana's store.  She is very happy that her hard work can support her family, help her father with the household and pay for her ill mother's treatment.  Liana worked with Kiva in 2009, and this is her second loan, with which help she wants to purchase a large inventory of spring merchandise from Yerevan and many kitchen accessories and dishware.  A large Christian holiday of Easter is coming up, and she hopes to make a good profit from holiday sales."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":788,"image":{"id":1309259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She grows potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, eggplant and many other vegetables in her garden, and also many fruits.  But Juleta especially cares for chickens and turkeys.  She has a large chicken farm near her house, where she keeps many chickens.  She already has many customers, who buy eggs and chicken meat right from her house.

This will allow her to improve the living conditions for her family.\r\n \r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
