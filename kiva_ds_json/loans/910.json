He has been working in his region for 12 years, being involved in various types of business, such as providing transportation services, reselling wood and selling animal feed.  He considers competition to be one of the primary difficulties in his work and this is why he does not stop on any single type of entrepreneurial focus.  Vasil plans to invest the loan in the amount of 5000 hryvnia into a purchase of a large wholesale inventory of feed for subsequent retail resale.  This purchase would contribute to the development of his business and help him to improve his quality of life.

Four of the children are at school excluding Yano. \r\n\r\nBesides spending her time as a housewife, Debora also assists her husband in generating extra income for their family by cultivating plants at the farm. She cultivates mustard greens, onion, corn, etc. From farming, Debora harvests the vegetables and sell them to the nearest market. The income from selling vegetables is spent on their household needs and the educational needs of her four children. Debora intends to produce more money by cultivating more plants i.e. kangkung or water spinach and chili, but she needs more capital to do so. Debora then submitted a loan application and requested a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 3,000,000 to purchase seedlings, pesticide and fertilizer. She hopes that the loan will help her improve her

He makes his sales mostly by cash in the city; Carlos' clients are mostly neighbors and people who have been referred to him who know he produces high quality furniture and a variety of products. \r\n\r\nWith his business, Carlos sustains his home and hopes that with his efforts his children will be able to finish their studies and be successful in whatever they do. Currently, Carlos is applying for this loan in order to buy raw materials such as wood and a sawing machine that he will use to smooth the wood and make it flat. With this investment, Carlos will have a more effective process, will be able to produce new designs, and will be able to improve the quality of his furniture, all of which would make this loan a successful one.

She cultivates plantain, yucca and papaya plants, which are the most heavily consumed staples in the region. She lives near the Arenal Volcano in the northern zone of Costa Rica, and began planting pepper plants 10 years ago. Her crops are doing very well, thanks to support from a local agriculture initiative program. Maria Teresa works with her partner, and their children are now grown and live on their own. Her farming and hard work have helped support her family, and she is a very humble, hardworking person who wants to grow her operation with Propica (the company that purchases her peppers and crops). \r\n\r\nFifteen years ago Maria Teresa came to the region, and received a parcel of land in a settlement with the Agrarian Development Institute. She has raised a family and farmed her land through much effort and hard work, and her family has lived off the income she has made selling her crops. She has her own house, and has worked to support her children in their pursuits.\r\n\r\nPresently, she is growing papaya and plantain crops, and is living off money from the sale of her produce. The local agriculture program Maria is a part of is encouraging farmers in the northern region to plant pepper crops, a crop that Maria used to cultivate several years ago. She wants to get back into growing peppers, and hopes this will help her generate additional income and increase her farming operation to better support her family.\r\n\r\nAs a farmer with much experience, Maria Teresa has her own land and a stable business. She wants to venture into planting peppers, a crop that she grew a decade ago, and she hopes to sign a contract with Propica for the purchase of her

That is why this time she will use the loan to capitalize her business and buy merchandise such as pre-cooked and frozen food in order to vary what she offers.\r\n\r\nDeysi is very grateful to Kiva for letting her offer her daughter a better education and for helping her stock her store and develop her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":927921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy merchandise such as pre-cooked and frozen food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2012-07-27T18:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-26T18:00:16Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deysi Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":126.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":130.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":119.69,"local_amount":119.69,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":119.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301335986,"comment":null},{"amount":123.25,"local_amount":123.25,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":123.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308092041,"comment":null},{"amount":126.92,"local_amount":126.92,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":126.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315326038,"comment":null},{"amount":130.14,"local_amount":130.14,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":130.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322934555,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-27T22:15:25Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:03:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":444232,"name":"Glenn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Glenn is 26 years old and lives in the Philippines.

With the loans, she has been able to achieve some modest investments (schooling of her children, chairs, etc). This new loan will help her to buy inventory of 10 bags of garlic and 4 bags of onions.

The group representative (with hand raised in photo) is named Adeline.  To increase their operating funds, the group is requesting a fourth loan through ALID\u00e9.  Adeline is 34 years old and married to a man named Paul.  The couple has four children, all in school and under their care.  Adeline left school at the primary level.  To meet her and her family's needs, Adeline is a hairstylist, a business she learned and has been practicing for about 15 years in her salon.  In addition to hairstyling, Adeline sells extensions and hair products at her salon.  She buys her supplies in the region.

They are all still attending school. Christine has been a fishmonger in a market in the capital for six years already, selling fresh fish. She buys a carton each time to retail, but that brings in very little, whereas she counts on this business to support her family.

Bogor Selatan is a city around 1 hours' driving from Indonesia\u2019s capital city, Jakarta. Although she is young, as in most Indonesian traditional families, she is married and has two children. Her first one has passed away, and now her second child is 2 years old. \r\n\r\nGyna owns a small shop selling Indonesian household needs starting with grocery items like rice, eggs, cooking oil and margarine, and going onto toiletries, cleaning tools and, of course, airtime prepaid minute. By selling airtime prepaid minutes, she met with Ruma [Kiva's Field Partner]. \r\n\r\nSince Ruma began bringing more income into her family by selling the minutes, Gyna agreed to try Ruma\u2019s new product. This new product will help Gyna serve customers better from her shop. It is called a <i>Loket Ruma<\/i> business. The premise in becoming a Loket Ruma agent is to provide a bill payment service for customers. Gyna hopes that people will come to her shop, not only to buy groceries or prepaid minutes, but also to pay electricity bills and motorcycle installments, to buy electricity vouchers for new house types and, last but not least, to pay credit card bills. She will be using an electronic data capture (EDC) machine to help create the payment transaction. This loan from Kiva will be used to pay the guarantee deposit money for an EDC. \r\n\r\nThe reason she wants to give the new product a try is to expand her business to the next level by maximizing what she can give to her customers. Another thing is: because this is an emerging product in the community. The EDC machine is simple, affordable capital. Ruma\u2019s money collection system allows Gyna to stay in her shop and Ruma\u2019s field officer comes to collect the money to become her capital again.
