Ayesha is a 27-year-old, vigorous lady; she has been stitching clothes for many years. She stitches for the people of her community and uses the income to support her entire family. However, due to a lack of available funds, she is unable to satisfy the daily demands of her customers. For this reason, she requested a loan of Rs 20,000 from Kashf Foundation.

Machundailu says that the small profit left after repayment of the loan is not sufficient to start another business. She wants to raise piglets besides being a vegetable seller, because she feels that she can manage these two activities together efficiently. She will sell vegetables on market days and feed the pigs in the morning and evening. She will purchase piglets with this Kiva loan and raise them to sell when fully grown. She is pleased because she will be able to facilitate a piggery with the support of WSDS and Kiva.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are also engaged in selling vegetables.

","en":"Bahromali is a 55 year old man. He is married and has children and grandchildren. He works as a guard at a workshop. Most of the work he does is raising livestock, at home. Bahromali takes animal husbandry seriously. Every 4-5 months he takes animals to the market to sell at a good price, and at the same time buys a pair of lambs or a calf to raise. He also shears sheep and sells their wool. His wife spins the wool into thread, which allows him to sell it at a higher price.

His business is located in the city center and his main customers are all ages and sexes. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 805,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan of Le 3,000,000. Alpha Bakarr has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan to buy more bedspreads, window linings, frames and flowers. He hopes that this loan will help by increasing his stock. In the future, Alpha Bakarr plans to move to a shop and be able to provide the needs of the family.

This form of work will allow her to generate income to support her household as much as she can, as she is married and has four children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the savings program."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":1323599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy beer and soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-04-03T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-03T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":4850,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascuala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":33358.99,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3329.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":483.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":484.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":494.34,"local_amount":3400.17,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3415.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625442,"comment":null},{"amount":483.96,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021399,"comment":null},{"amount":483.96,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809207,"comment":null},{"amount":967.91,"local_amount":6657.44,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6687.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669277,"comment":null},{"amount":483.96,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915038,"comment":null},{"amount":483.95,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197669,"comment":null},{"amount":483.96,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153440,"comment":null},{"amount":967.96,"local_amount":6657.78,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6688.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-22T00:21:57Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:41:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544148,"name":"Radhi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called \u201cRadhi\u201d; it is made up of three ladies and one man.

is 62 years old. He lives in Rustavi District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and an infant granddaughter. Nodar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the income of his wife and daughter-in-law. They both are working as salesladies. In addition, his son works as an artisan and gets a small monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNodar requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nKoba requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Koba will renovate a space located in his yard and purchase all the needed equipment to start his own bakery. He would not have to pay rent and, thus, the income of the family will increase. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She requires improving her business, so she applied for a loan of Rs. 30,000 from Kashf Foundation. In this way, she will be able to buy another waan-making machine for her husband to use, to assist her in his free time.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking to a loan officer at Kashf, she said that her children have never slept without having a meal, ever since she started working on her own. She wishes to use part of the revenue generated by using the loan, for the betterment of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":262.76,"image":{"id":1324633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy another waan-making machine for her husband to use, to assist her in his free time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Kasur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.115556 74.446667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-04-03T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-03T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalsoom ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2123},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2185},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2249},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2315},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2383},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2452},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2524},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2598},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2674},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2752},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2832},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2913}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":2123,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2264.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364557489,"comment":null},{"amount":23.67,"local_amount":2185,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2330.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372955984,"comment":null},{"amount":24.36,"local_amount":2249,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2398.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381736423,"comment":null},{"amount":25.08,"local_amount":2315,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2469.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390822870,"comment":null},{"amount":25.82,"local_amount":2383,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2541.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399843181,"comment":null},{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":2452,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410118005,"comment":null},{"amount":27.35,"local_amount":2524,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2691.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419883257,"comment":null},{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":2598,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2770.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429531862,"comment":null},{"amount":58.78,"local_amount":5426,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5787.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439755682,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-04T03:35:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544201,"name":"Familia M Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cFamilia M\u201d tiene ya varios ciclos trabajando con la instituci\u00f3n el grupo est\u00e1 conformado por cuatro integrantes y todos son familiares.

The members chose the group name \"Hummingbird\" because they liked it; however, the coordinator helped them choose \"Nightingale.\" Bonifacia, 37, is the group's representative.

She says, \"I started this activity because I thought that having extra money besides my husband's income and being able to help with the household expenses and my children's education was always a good thing.\" Bonifacia buys very young turkeys because they are cheap. She raises and fattens them to sell at a higher price, usually to her neighbors when there is a holiday.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for this loan to buy more turkeys, and if there is money left, to buy feed. \"I learned this trade as a girl from my mother, who raised turkeys to sell when times were hard.\" Though she has a lot of experience, Bonifacia's turkeys get sick at times, which means she could lose her investment.

Juanita has had a grocery store for seven years and she relates that she stared out selling soft-drinks and eggs which were the products that sold the most and more easily because they are products that are consumed the most but later started to sell other things because the people in the community themselves would ask her why she didn\u2019t sell other things that were indispensable for the homes of the members of the community.  \r\n\r\nJuanita relates that she\u2019s gradually been growing.  For example, she used to not have well-established site and now she does although at present she still needs a good display case because she places some things on a table; she also needs to buy a refrigerator to start selling dairy products and cold cuts that would be very conducive to her business\u2019 growth.\r\n\r\nJuanita said: \u201cI would like my business to grow so that I can help my children finish professional careers so they can have better futures and not have to go through the difficulties we as parents are going through.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1322896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Los Lobos Segunda Seccion, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-04-03T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-03T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lluvia Luzandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":796.87,"local_amount":9750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-22T09:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":9828.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663559,"comment":null},{"amount":531.26,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6552.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048973,"comment":null},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6552.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840142,"comment":null},{"amount":265.62,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3276.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698466,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-05T15:16:38Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T14:20:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544208,"name":"Concepcion Primitiva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

They earn enough through this business to contribute to the family's income. \r\n\r\nIn order to inflate their sales, Naseem needs to purchase a stock of gram flour, along with packs of oil, salt, and spices. For this, she contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of PKR 40,000. She is in her sixth loan cycle, with good repayment history. She wishes to spend part of the revenue on the betterment of her family members. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":304.64,"image":{"id":1324593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase for her business a stock of gram flour, along with packs of oil, salt, and spices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Jhang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-04-03T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-03T18:20:06Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naseem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2831},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2914},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2999},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3087},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3177},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3270},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3365},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3464},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3565},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3669},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3776},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3883}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.08,"local_amount":2831,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2961.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364557492,"comment":null},{"amount":30.96,"local_amount":2914,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3048.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372955987,"comment":null},{"amount":31.87,"local_amount":2999,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3137.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381735702,"comment":null},{"amount":66.55,"local_amount":6264,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6552.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390822873,"comment":null},{"amount":34.74,"local_amount":3270,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3420.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410118007,"comment":null},{"amount":35.76,"local_amount":3365,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3519.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419883260,"comment":null},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":3464,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3623.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429531865,"comment":null},{"amount":37.88,"local_amount":3565,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3729.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439755685,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-04T03:04:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544168,"name":"Ellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ellen lives in Sinkor, in Montserrado County, the capital city of Liberia.

He is a native of the Nacintal district on the outskirts of Teustepe. He is married and is the father of four children, ages 6, 10, 13, and 15. All of them are in school. His work is farming. He works in one of the most common activities in the city of Teustepe, which is planting corn, beans, and wheat. He has been in this business for more than 12 years. Due to his impoverished condition, he was not able to go to school. He began his agricultural activity by helping his parents on the land. Then he decided to become independent. He began to plant for himself with his own money. Leandro not only takes charge of planting, but he also milks his cows. In his planting work he pays helpers. He sells his products in Managua. His expectations are to increase the production of his plantings and his animals.\r\n\r\nLeandro needs this loan to pay for labor and buy supplies, compost, and fertilizer, which he needs to plant beans and corn this year.

is 23 years old and is from the Senaki District. He has a large family: a wife, an infant son, a mother, a cousin, a step-daughter and a grandmother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Temur requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTemur has a commercial space, which is rented and they get 650 Laris (GEL) per month. It is hardly enough for food for such a large family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTemur requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Temur will purchase a car cheaply abroad and resell it then at a higher price.

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Lili will buy eight calves. After purchasing calves, she plans to raise them and when they are fattened properly she will resell them at a higher price. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

","en":"Dilorom is a widow and the mother of four children.  She's 35 years old and lives with children and mother in the Yavan region of Tajikistan.

From a very young age he managed to teach himself to do farmwork, since this was the only source of support for his family.  Now, after working independently for 20 years, he has decided to continue to work growing organic cocoa.  Leonidas owns agricultural land, and he is growing organic cocoa on almost 70 percent of the area that he works jointly with his wife and, occasionally, his children.  He really appreciates his work because he doesn't have to rely on others to perform the labor, and because he considers cocoa to be one of the best-selling products in his area.

Thanks to the jungle climate it is possible to grow good quality cocoa beans, and so this is a good business alternative for the producers in the area.  \r\n\r\nAt this time, Victor wants to invest in grafted cocoa, and for that he needs to hire day laborers who know the technique in order to perform this task as quickly as possible.

As this is his first Kiva loan, he is thankful for the opportunity that he is being provided, and he promises to make his payments on time.  \r\n\r\nWith this 4,000 Peruvian soles he requests, he will buy organic fertilizer for his crops, and he will also hire local workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1324748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer and hire local workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-03T21:30:31Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-03T21:30:31Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":430.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":464.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":472.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":489.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":509.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":525.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":546.03},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":561.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.83,"local_amount":430.54,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":432.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578102,"comment":null},{"amount":179.85,"local_amount":464.11,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":465.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530330,"comment":null},{"amount":183.06,"local_amount":472.43,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":474.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975358,"comment":null},{"amount":191.26,"local_amount":493.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":495.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996627,"comment":null},{"amount":198.58,"local_amount":512.47,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":514.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864108,"comment":null},{"amount":202.44,"local_amount":522.43,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":524.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352451,"comment":null},{"amount":214.93,"local_amount":554.66,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":556.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904303,"comment":null},{"amount":213.05,"local_amount":549.79,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":552,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090400,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T18:17:31Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544218,"name":"Fortunata","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia se sigue dedicando al negocio de crianza de cuyes,la socia los hece engordar y crecer y luego los vende en las diferentes ferias,la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 5:00 p.m,la socia ya tiene 7 a\u00f1os en este negocio y le va muy bien,el sue\u00f1o de la socia es tener un local donde puead vender los cuyes.La socia solicita el credito para comprar cuyes y alimentos para cuyes.\n\n\nLa  socia agradece el apoyo que se le otorgara y as\u00ed mismo se compromete a cumplir de manera disciplinada con los pagos de las cuotas.\n","en":"Fortunata continues to make a living in raising guinea bigs.

49, lives with his wife and son in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family resides on a plot of land in their own house which was built with loan funds. Davaajav's wife has been sewing deel (a Mongolian traditional costume) at home for 14 years. His second son lives on his own, and his youngest son now studies at university. Davaajav himself has been running a transportation business using his own truck since 2008 and accumulated vast amounts of experience. He is requesting a loan of 5500000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as fiberglass, cotton, foam, bricks and planks. During this period of time, the price of building and insulation materials reaches its lowest level and buying them now will save him a considerable amount of money. Using those building and insulation materials, he will build his own house which will enable the family to burn less coal in comparison with a Mongolian traditional ger (portable felt dwelling). During winter times, especially last winter, family members are chilled to their core due to strong snow storms blowing walls and frost forming between felt layers of their ger. So, building a house is the best way of staying warm during the cold winter and, more importantly, of reducing coal usage to contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for better future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1371.58,"image":{"id":1325031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Fortunato has dedicated the past 30 years of his life to organic cacao farming. Before settling into cacao farming, he raised and bred cattle, though it was challenging to locate and return cows to his herd that had strayed out of the pasture. \r\n\r\nAs one of the pioneers of organic fertilizer and manure in his area, Fortunato has been quite pleased with the healthy results it yields in conjunction with his experienced farming techniques. He hopes that an increasing number of farmers will switch to organic manure and fertilizers in the near future. As he expands his farming operation, he requires more fertilizer for tending his cacao trees and producing a high-quality harvest. One of his long term goals is to open a small grocery store in the city center where his wife could work to generate additional income for their family.  This is his first loan, and he promises to make all scheduled repayments on time.

Using these materials, she can make an extension to her house and insulate the interior walls and windows.

Renan operates a junk shop.  \n\nSince trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags while waiting for their local dump trucks.  They scavenge for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials.  They sell these to junk shops like Joey\u2019s for a little profit.  Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries such as factories.  His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\n\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, he is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan.  He will be incorporating the loan with his current revolving fund, which is used to buy trash from collectors.  He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \n\nRenan hopes that his business will continue to grow and he dreams that his family will have a good life.  He meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his life and business every week and to draw strength from the Word of God he studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She presently lives with just her husband in the home that they bought 40 years ago.\r\n\r\nSince she was young, she learned to work in the field. She says that at an early age she started her family, so she had to begin working in the harvest of potato, corn, beans, and the other plants typical of the area. She inherited the extensive area of agricultural land that she possesses from her parents. It is in this way that in each harvest she sells her produce in the market of her locality, since she is known for growing organic corn. Now she wants to improve her income, as her main difficulty in negotiating her harvests is language since she speaks Quechua. This is her first loan with Kiva; she is grateful for the opportunity that they're offering her since she will be able to improve her business. For this reason, she promises to be timely with her installment payments.

His loan requests were always rejected, due to his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is trading. In particular, Vano purchases iron at wholesale prices and then resells at a higher price. However, it is hardly enough to pay for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nVano requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved within the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit Vano will purchase a milking cow so the family can produce dairy products to sell. This will increase the family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of Vano's family.

She lives in the small village of the Sachkhere district with husband and two sons. \r\n\r\nManana has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nManana\u2019s husband and son are working as truck drivers and get a small monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nManana requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as high risk borrowers because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Manana will purchase a milking cow and sheep. After purchasing the livestock, Manana will be able to produce dairy products for selling. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1325135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a milking cow and sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Chorvila","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-04T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-04T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":93.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":102.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":108.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":112.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":114.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":117.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":121.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":124.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":128.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":131.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":134.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":138.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.53,"local_amount":82.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":83.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570439,"comment":null},{"amount":47.84,"local_amount":78.44,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":79.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969106,"comment":null},{"amount":47.86,"local_amount":78.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":79.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749525,"comment":null},{"amount":1378.77,"local_amount":2260.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613433,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-10T19:18:50Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544417,"name":"Carina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carina, 48 years of age, is married to a government employee and blessed with four children. \r\n\r\nShe has a direct selling business in which she sells personal use products in their village.
