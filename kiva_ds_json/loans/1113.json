She began this business on her own initiative with little capital, and she currently wishes to expand it.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out is for a capital increase for fruit purchase. She will acquire the fruit in the fairs in the city of El Alto and will subsequently sell it in her retail space.

","en":"Holniso is a joyful, optimistic woman, and a caring wife and mother to two children. She stood out from her peers even in school for her enterprising nature and drive to achieve her goals. After finishing high school she was unable to enroll in a university because her parents decided to marry her off. At first Holniso lived off of her husband, but when children came her husband's income became insufficient for the family. She decided to start her own business, by renting a store in the center of the clothing market and importing women's clothing to sell. Today, 13 years later, she is still in the business. She has won many loyal customers who consider her an organized and responsible woman. The business has earned her a good income, which she spends on her children's education. Her husband works as a laborer in Russia and sends money home each month. Now Holniso wants to make a large purchase of summer clothing to match the season and improve her sales. To do that, Holniso came to Arvand for a loan to buy summer clothing for future sale. She thanks you for your support in advance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1340972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy summer season women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-06T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-05T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Holniso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":699.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":721.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":743.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":766.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":789.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":814.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":839.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":865.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":892.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":919.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":948.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1900,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":9038.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752021,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T01:25:03Z","paid_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555693,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is a 28-year-old married man.

The loan will help these small businesses, including Amalia's. This is her first experience with Pro Mujer, joining after one of the institution's promoters invited her after visiting her home. Amalia currently has a business selling cosmetics, which she started on her own after learning the trade from her friend. She plans to use the loan to increase her capital to purchase cosmetics from wholesale distributors, and she will then sell the products from her sales space.

is 46 years old. She lives in Kutaisi district, West Georgia with her 49 year old husband, 20 year old son and daughter in-law.  Nana requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNana\u2019s husband is an artisan. He works on house renovations for private orders and earns a small monthly income. This is the only source of living for the family, which is rarely enough to cover their monthly expenses. \r\n\r\nNana requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Nana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

He has 50 years of experience working with livestock.  When he started his business, he had one sheep that he looked after.  Kuzimat himself says, \"I took very good care of my only sheep.  Dozens of heads of livestock were only a dream then.  Now it is a reality, it's my income and livelihood.\"  With time, he became more clever in the industry.  At the beginning, it was difficult for him, especially during the winter when the land was covered in snow and it cost him much to feed his animals.  But through the years, Kuzimat has proven himself and has come to find solutions to the obstacles he faces which help him move forward.  Today he has more than 10 head of cattle and 10 other animals.  His wife and three children are also involved in the business--his wife milks the cows.  The money earned from selling milk, yogurt and cottage cheese is used to pay for everyday expenses.  Because of the season, Kuzimat is unable to sell his sheep and cows, or buy feed since prices have fallen.  He needs additional funds for feed and to buy new animals.  With this goal, he turned to Arvand for a loan.  He believes the loan will allow him to eliminate his financial difficulties.  He is grateful to Arvand for the assistance and huge role it plays in his life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1343005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

It is composed of women stemming from the same village, who are now on their second loan, and have learned new practices related to saving and solidarity. They are all involved in small commercial activities. Mrs Fatoumata (seen in a special image located on the top right of the photo) is the star lender in the group. She is 53 year old, married, a mother of eight children, including two boys. She is involved in the sale of palm oil and rice, that she purchases in the local markets and resells in her village to individual customers. This new loan will allow her to purchase two bags of rice for 15 000 FCFA, a box of teas, and a 20 liter container of palp oil for 15 000 FCFA. She plans to use the profits from these sales to support her husband in taking care of their children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3975,"image":{"id":1344758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He graduated as a Biologist and at the moment he is in charge of municipal services for a state institution.  One of his biggest dreams is to have a restaurant since he is passionate about pleasing people's palates and making exquisite dishes.\r\n\r\nNow his big project is to take a cooking course at university to later start his business and win over potential customers with the quality of food. For this reason he is requesting a loan with Ceprodel to be able to study this course, since it is expensive and with his wages he can't cover it.\r\n\r\nHe is asking Kiva lenders to support him with his request to be able to carry out his goals and in the future to fulfill his big dream.

has four children. He lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is extremely fertile for agriculture. He is a farmer, which he has been doing for 10 years.  His primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops. What Benson enjoys most about farming is dairy keeping. His biggest challenge is drought.\r\n\r\nBenson is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo because it works with farmers and teaches clients how to keep records.

is Helen, 58, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Montano, a farmer, and she is a mother to her children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating a business. They are working hand-in-hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHelen owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) of jeepney, which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 17,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and to pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nHelen hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life.  Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn money and modified the jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Filipino.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

The group of women in that area maintain savings and participate in group activities to earn income.  They have been doing this work for eight years, they have requested loans before, and they know about group work.  They formed an executive board and are requesting a second loan for Banco Mujer Mujeres Esforzadas.  The president of the board rotates; currently it is Herminia, and Katia just left the post.  \n\nTheir work and effort has allowed them to have their consolidated work, which is the sale of clothing, shoes, perfumes, and other items.  The loan will contribute to improving the working conditions of the group.  It will allow them to invest for mid-year, increase their inventory, and cover orders for mid-year vacations and Father's Day.  \n\nThey collect money for their repayment weekly, which allows them to have a larger payment margin.  \n\nSome of these women are the heads of their household.  This is the case of Herminia, who works selling food in the area.  She also sells clothing which she brings to San Jos\u00e9 and makes trips to the Panama border.

Her school is located in a rural area 10 km from this municipality, where she has to travel by bicycle every day to be on time at her workplace.\r\n\r\nShe is an admirable woman, who on her own has supported her daughters all these years without the support of the father. She has improved her home through her own efforts with her salary.\r\n\r\nDue the fact that the winter season is approaching and the roof of our house is in poor condition, she needs a loan to repair it. So at this time she is requesting a loan from Ceprodel to carry out her objective which involves buying sheet metal roofing, nails and paying for labor.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the support of the Kiva investors as she knows that they are good-hearted people who help the neediest: low-income people. She trusts in God that they will approve her request, for which she will be eternally grateful."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":306.19,"image":{"id":1338630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy sheet metal roofing, nails, and pay for labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-05-06T16:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-05T16:50:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karla Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":802.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":819.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":868.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":890.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":927.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":976.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1006.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1056.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1092.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1138.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1195.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.09},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.44,"local_amount":802.6,"processed_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":836.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115724,"comment":null},{"amount":34.17,"local_amount":819.93,"processed_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":854.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675395,"comment":null},{"amount":36.17,"local_amount":868.1,"processed_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":904.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539671,"comment":null},{"amount":37.09,"local_amount":890.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":928,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788903,"comment":null},{"amount":38.65,"local_amount":927.48,"processed_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":966.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410065215,"comment":null},{"amount":40.69,"local_amount":976.52,"processed_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419829093,"comment":null},{"amount":41.95,"local_amount":1006.9,"processed_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1049.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430384871,"comment":null},{"amount":44.03,"local_amount":1056.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1101.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978605,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-08T19:23:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555873,"name":"Kiran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kiran is 27 years old and works as a tailor.

fall, Unita\u2019s story was shared with the Kiva community, and thanks to you, Unita received a $5,000 Kiva loan to pursue her business dreams and open up her own day spa.  Six months after her loan funded on Kiva, her business has expanded drastically.  Her Kiva loan helped her to market her business and reach hundreds of customers with an online deal.  Unita is without a doubt a Kiva success story.\r\n\r\nBoth financially savvy and proactive, Unita has come back to refinance her loan.  Today a loan of $8,000 will be used to completely repay her previous Kiva loan and enable Unita to purchase more equipment and acquire a larger space.  With this new space, Unita will be able to expand her business to accommodate her growing number of clients.  With more rooms and massage tables, Unita will also be able to hire a team of massage therapists.\r\n\r\nUnita\u2019s aspiration to become an entrepreneur started at a young age.  \u201cI had no footprints to follow,\u201d Unita shared as she reflected on her childhood. \u201cMany people around me lacked the motivation to boost their own economic situation, choosing not to further their education nor pursue avenues of self improvement.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter receiving a very memorable massage, Unita was inspired to become a massage therapist and she committed to giving, receiving and studying massage therapy.

","en":"Ilyos is a kind and honest man who is 47 years old.  He is married and has 5 children.  His wife is a homemaker who raises the children who don't yet have their own families.  Since his childhood, Ilyos has worked fattening cattle and knows all the advantages of the industry.  His older children help him with the work.  Additionally, they have a small farm, but the income from it is very small.  Therefore, Ilyos is trying to expand his business fattening cattle.  Every two weeks, he takes his fattened cattle to a market and sells them at a premium.  He then immediately buys new, young cows.  He very much likes this part of his work since he loves animals.  Every day, Ilyos' son takes the animals to a pasture not far from their home.  He bought his son a horse which makes his son's job a bit easier since he had to do it on foot before.  Ilyos plans to marry off his oldest son who is already grown this year.  For this, he should save money to be able to provide worthy wedding celebrations.  He has turned to Arvand to take out a loan to increase his number of cattle.  Ilyos hopes that Arvand will help him and that with this loan, he will be able to buy a few head of cattle and save the needed amount for his son's celebration."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":637.3,"image":{"id":1339431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-06T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-05T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ilyos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":315.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":322.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":329.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":336.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":343.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":353.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":315.2,"local_amount":315.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":315.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550101,"comment":null},{"amount":322.1,"local_amount":322.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":322.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774326,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T15:41:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555932,"name":"Rogelio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rogelio is 26 years old and single.

Since 2008, Mwera has been running a chicken project where he grows them and, later on after growing, sells them to the hotels and other customers. He is doing fine in his project.This project enables him to obtain his family's basic needs.  He works from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily and is able to make a fair profit per month. \r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania, which he will use to buy more chicks (about 500) to reach more customers.

He is a carpenter and has been making a variety of types of furniture since 1989. He works from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily and is able to make a good profit each month. \r\n\r\nJoktan is in his early forties. He and his wife have four children, all of whom are enrolled in school.\r\n\r\nThis will be Joktan's tenth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. With the previous loans, all of which he has repaid successfully, he has bought larger quantities of wood and has made larger quantities of furniture, which he has then been able to sell to more clients.

For the past year, she has been running a caf\u00e9 where she sells water, soft drinks, and some kinds of food. Halima works from seven in the morning through 10 at night and is able to make a good monthly profit. She is doing fine. Halima has requested 12 previous loans through Tujijenge Tanzania. She used her previous loans to replace stock in her cafe such as cartons of drinking water.

He plants vegetables such as: beans, peas, corn, potatoes, salad, cauliflower and other vegetables in plots that he rents in two ways: with money or with his products. \r\n\r\nFour years ago he started buying and selling vegetables he got from his neighbors or from his own harvest. \r\n\r\nWith Lucy's help he takes his merchandise to the city of Oroya located an hour and a half from Tarma. \r\n\r\n\"Selling in Oroya is very profitable because the city does not produce anything being a mining center\" he says. \r\n\r\nHe hopes for economic stability so he can raise his youngest children without any problems. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan from Kiva.

Kosar is a 35-year-old married woman and a mother of five children. She has been involved in the milk sales business for many years with the support of her husband. The man shown in the photo is Kosar\u2019s husband. Before starting this milk production business, Kosar's family often lived in hand-to-mouth conditions. So she decided to support her family to provide a better and more secure future for her children. Now she has two buffaloes and one cow in milk; she sells its milk to many people in her community.

By doing this, she will be able to increase her crops and obtain a better profit from her crops.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to buy a plot of land in order to build a home for her children and to cultivate a greater variety of produce to offer to her customers, since in this way she will be able to increase her revenue and help her children with their studies so they can graduate at university level.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700.79,"image":{"id":1344984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase certified potato seeds so she can plant her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-05-07T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-06T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":1.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381922845,"comment":null},{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":0.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390787324,"comment":null},{"amount":350.18,"local_amount":6670.04,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6733.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399793665,"comment":null},{"amount":0.04,"local_amount":0.76,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":0.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070254,"comment":null},{"amount":0.25,"local_amount":4.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833693,"comment":null},{"amount":0.07,"local_amount":1.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042165,"comment":null},{"amount":350.14,"local_amount":6669.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6733.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710457,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-07T11:13:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":556002,"name":"Ishrat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms Ishrat is a married woman and a mother of three.

Mabinty says that her business is doing well because out of the profit, she feeds her children.\r\n\r\nMabinty has requested a loan in order to buy foodstuff like flour, cooking oil and sugar to expand her business.

Nevertheless, she is also sponsoring orphans in her school by providing them with free education to give them an opportunity of a better future.\r\n\r\nDue to her hard work, Barbara set up a preparatory school which includes Kindergarten and primary level with the aim of providing quality education to citizens of Uganda, not only those who can afford it,  but also the poor.  In the same line, she has always striven to see that the poor also get an education, basing it on God\u2019s principle that all men are equal regardless of their social status.  This philosophy is the result of Barbara being born from a poor family with no stable source of income.\r\n\r\nBarbara has always dreamed of and was determined to set up a Secondary  School, so that students from her preparatory school can join directly with no hastle and also the least privileged can get a chance of advancing to higher levels of education.  Through her vision there is free education for the orphans and the poor people.

La tierra que ella y su pareja trabajan esta a una distancia de 16 kil\u00f3metros a la cual se trasladan diariamente para su debido control y mantenimiento como lo es: Limpieza, poda, fertilizaci\u00f3n y abono al mismo.\n\nActualmente Virgilia solicita ayuda para poder comprar abono y fertilizantes para sus cultivos de papa ya que de esta forma ella mantendr\u00e1 sano y salvo de plagas y bichos sus cultivos.\n\nSus planes son de poder ampliar sus tierra para poder cultivar mas producto y arreglar su casa de habitaci\u00f3n para que sus hijos puedan vivir en mejores condiciones y mas c\u00f3modos. Sus sue\u00f1os son que sus hijos se preparen a nivel universitario para que sean hombres y mujeres de provecho.","en":"Virgilia is a 39-year-old married woman with 3 children, of whom two are minors and the eldest is at primary school.  She, herself, in spite of only having been educated to fifth grade at primary school, is a fighter.  It was her parents who taught her how to work the land (growing vegetables) when she was still very young.  She very much enjoys her work, having taken a liking to it at an early age, and is pleased with the experience she has gained.  She does not, however, only work in agriculture; she also sells her produce (in particular the coffee which grows in abundance and safety throughout the region where the land and atmosphere are ideal for growing crops).  She sells her produce through intermediaries who visit the region, as well as to neighbours and to others at the trading area which they travel to.  The land which she and her partner farm is 16 kilometres away, which means a daily journey to carry out the necessary checks and maintenance tasks such as: cleaning, pruning and applying fertiliser and manure.  Virgilia is seeking this loan to buy manure and fertiliser to protect her potato crops from pests and bugs.  She plans to extend the land she farms so as to boost production and to make improvements to her home to provide better and more comfortable living conditions for her children.  Her ambition is to see her children receive a university education which will enable them to become successful men and women.

The farm products at the end of the harvest are then shared with the Zamindars (the farm owners), which always leaves her family with a very small income and harvest. \r\n\r\nJangmei refers to Hannah Group as a life saver because after she joined the group, she could avail loans from WSDS. She bought piglets and also constructed a pig sty at the back of her house to raise them. Now, she can raise pigs as well as continue her vegetable plantations, which eventually will increase her income. \r\n\r\nShe plants vegetables according to seasonal changes and keeps herself busy throughout the year. She sells vegetables to women vegetable vendors and her main supply is chives. She says her main income is generated after selling chives because it can be grown throughout the year. \r\n\r\nAfter she joined the group, she could send her children to boarding schools. She could pay the school expenses after she sold her fully grown pigs.

She is pictured with hand raised and she is the featured borrower.\r\n\r\nVeijahat rents a place in the town market shed and she sells various dried fish, dried-chilly and seasonal vegetables too. This includes seeds of pea, mustard, beans, cabbage, lady fingers, brinjals, pumpkin. She also takes advantage of seasonal plantation and sells vegetable seeds and saplings. She makes good money during the plantation season because almost the entire region is engaged in farming and people throng in the town market looking for different vegetable seeds and saplings. She also grows vegetables at the back of her house and sells them too. With the small profits she makes, she pays her monthly loan repayment, pays the house rent and also does household maintenance.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of the Kiva loan, Veijahat is planning to purchase Kharif (summer) seeds and saplings. She will get the supplies from the city and sell them in the town market. She believes these will be useful for the villagers who can avoid spending extra for fares to get to the city to purchase the seeds. Veijahat says that after she received the loan from WSDS, she could manage the household expenses and save her husband\u2019s salary for the children's education. She adds that her youngest son is pursuing his M.Phil in the capital city and one of her daughters is undergoing nursing training. \u201cThese are my accomplishments as a mother\u201d says Veijahat.\r\n\t\t\r\nShe thanks Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful support shown upon her and the rest of the group members and is glad to be a part of the team and feels blessed.

is a married woman with four children.

To prepare palm oil, she washes the palm fruits and boils them until they become soft and tender. She scoops the cooked fruit into a big mortar and gently pounds it with a pestle to avoid damaging the nut. Water is then added to the pounded fruit. The mixture of water and the pounded fruit is squeezed and filtered to get the juice out and remove the chaff. The chaff is sometimes used by the local people to light charcoal fires. The juice is boiled again and, as it boils, the fresh oil floats to the surface of the pot. The oil is scooped into yet another pot and left to cool. Palm oil is the preferred type of cooking oil, because Ghanaians like its consistency and flavor. It is used in most traditional dishes. Her husband is a farmer. Mather uses her income to assist the husband with the basic needs of the home. Mather will use the loan to purchase heads of palm fruits from the local farmers.

is an enterprising woman with many dreams to fulfill. She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her four children. She loves her family and claims they are her greatest strength for getting up each morning and working hard to generate an income. \r\n\r\nSince 2004, she has been working as a tailor. She provides stitching services in her community. Her eldest daughter also helps her in stitching up dresses. She has excellent stitching skills, and due to the money she generates, she has managed to provide a better quality of life for her family. \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to expand her business and to purchase one more sewing machine, as her number of customers is increasing day by day. However, because of having only one machine, she cannot easily cope up with all the customers on time and that results in a loss of money and customers. Therefore, she is asking for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to invest in the purchase of a sewing machine, which will allow her to fulfill the demands of customers more efficiently and to elevate her level of income. \r\n\r\nWith the profit amount, she wishes to start a general store business in her home to sell a variety of products, including biscuits, tea packs, rice, etc. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC
