Askar has been blessed by five caring daughters who attend school and also help out with household duties. Askar is a building contractor. This work is seasonal, and sometimes it is hard to find customers. This is why Askar decided to launch a business in a different field. He has chosen to raise livestock, more specifically to buy and resell cattle, as this business brings in revenues year round. Askar has experience taking care of animals since his family already keeps cows. Askar is requesting a loan to buy six young bulls. He plans to buy six heads of cattle every month, fatten them for a month and then bring to the animal market in the region. Askar believes that his new business will be successful and bring in good revenues, and, as a result, the financial well-being of his family will improve.

He has lived in the community for eight years with his wife and three children.  The last of his children was born in May of this year.\r\n\r\nHe has worked for six years at a sugar refinery during the season for harvesting sugarcane.  When he leaves his work at the sugar refinery he also works at a nearby farm, and he grows his \u2018manzana\u2019 [a land measurement unit equivalent to 1.740 acres] of corn and beans.\r\n\r\nHis daughters are in the fourth and the second grades of elementary school, and they go to the closest school.  In the community there is no electrical lighting.  Currently his family is using lights run by batteries.  They buy batteries because they last longer, and they avoid a fire that could be caused by using candles in their house.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting the loan to buy a 60 watt solar panel.

After being at the location for a few months, the landlord placed a condition to Marc requiring that his mini market only sell African food, otherwise they would not be allowed to retain the location. \r\n\r\nWithout proper resources to secure a resolution, Marc left the location and the unused prepaid rent, for which he was entitled to receiving a reimbursement. Marc has moved on and has since secured a new location with a new landlord. He is now seeking a microloan to finance the store\u2019s inventory.

She lives in the \"20 de Noviembre\" neighborhood of Puntarenas, a place with a lot of poverty and social problems.  She is 48 years old, and lives with her husband and daughter, who currently attends school.  With effort and hard work, and with the support of Fundacion Mujer for more than 15 years, Mayra has managed to establish a customer base for her business selling clothing and personal items, which she sells door-to door. She has managed to give her daughters an education, acquire other goods, and along with her husband, who tends to a small grocery store, they have managed to get ahead.  \r\n\r\nThe goal for this loan is to buy merchandise, mainly seasonal clothing, because in Costa Rica, Mother's Day is approaching (August 15), and so she doesn't want to miss the opportunity to change her products.  Because of her experience and knowledge of the market, this is something that her customers look forward to with anticipation.  \r\n\r\nMayra belongs to the communal bank \"Mujer Creciendo Juntas,\" which has supported other women with loans for their businesses, but at her level, she needs to make a bigger investment in her small business.  \r\n\r\nAmong her goals, the one that stands out is to get ahead so that her family can have a better future and improve their quality of life.  She also wants to support her business so that it grows over time.  At this time, her greatest difficulty has been the economy, and also the competition from the people who sell from catalogs.  However, she has found support for her small business in this program, and with her experience she has managed to maintain a set of active customers who have good credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":189.71,"image":{"id":1382684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Puntarenas, 20 de Noviembre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2013-07-03T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-02T21:30:04Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":22790.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":23170.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":23556.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":23949.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":24348.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":24754.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25167.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25586.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":26013.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":26446.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":26887.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":27327.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.97,"local_amount":22986.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":23095.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400039430,"comment":null},{"amount":46.37,"local_amount":23183.1,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":23293.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410094998,"comment":null},{"amount":47.12,"local_amount":23560.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":23673.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430063404,"comment":null},{"amount":50.25,"local_amount":25126.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25246.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439997398,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T02:03:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":578948,"name":"Khalida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalida is a 44-year-old married woman.

Anusuya, the energetic lady of 40 years sitting second from right with raised hand, is one of them. She is very active and always cheerful. Her family consists of her husband, one son aged seventeen, and three daughters aged twenty-five, twenty-three and twenty.\n\nFrom last twenty five years Anusuya is running a cloth vending business with the help and support of her husband.As this is their traditional business, her husband was already doing this business before her marriage. After marriage both of them are managing the business. She purchases saris from the local market and from the weavers of her village and brings the ready-made garments from a wholesale market 200 kilometers away. Her husband moves to different villages and weekly markets on a bike for selling saris and garments. \n\nShe earns a monthly income of 8,000 Indian Rupees (INR) from her existing business, but that is not sufficient to manage the business expenses as well as the household expenses for her six-member family. So Anusuya wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business. Looking into the coming festive season, from the present loan she is planning to purchase some quality saris and fancy garments for selling. Anusuya assumes that this will definitely generate a handsome amount of extra income. Anusuya has a dream to save enough money for the marriage of her daughters in a respectable manner.\n\nThe other three members of the group are Sanjuta with Tiffin business and Saraswati and Sindhu with cloth vending business.

He lives with his wife, who's his main priority. With his loan he intends to purchase a calf so that he can raise it and sell it for butchering. The idea is to make good use of the space he has for pasture, which is well developed, and of the good conditions of the soil and the weather. That way he'll be able to have the animal and raise a good calf in order to sell it for butchering later on. With this purchase he'll start another line of work and save some money at the same time, which will allow him to gradually have more animals and invest more in his land. This is the first loan he has received from FUDECOSUR. He hasn't had other loans with state banks before, but FUDECOSUR has provided the loan with easier repayment terms and a much lower interest rate."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0.57,"image":{"id":1382745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a calf.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Miguel, Pejibaye","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2013-07-04T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-03T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.57,"local_amount":287.22,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":288.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855294,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-06T21:04:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":578996,"name":"Titus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Titus is 24 years old, single and supports his three siblings.

is 53 years old. He lives in the small village of Sachkhere District with his wife and 20-year-old son. Murman has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMurman is an artisan and works on private orders to renovate houses. Additionally, he is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has two pigs and sells piglets. The income is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMurman has now requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Murman has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

Using those materials, her husband can make repairs and insulate their house, thus providing more comfortable and warmer accommodations for the whole family. \r\n\r\nThe renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, thus releasing less pollutants into the air, which contributes to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

However, all her children are enrolled in schools, and her income is barely enough to provide for one person. Thus, she decided to acquire the group loan from Al Majmoua to settle the schooling tuition fees of her children. This would allow her children to acquire the proper education she did not have the opportunity to obtain.\r\n\r\nAs for the other group members, Marilou is the lady wearing a cap, Sahlee is the woman

She had to leave the school to find a job to support her family. The cats and dogs she rescued during this period helped her make it through the grieving process and cope with the challenge of having to leave school and help support her family.\r\n \r\nShe has worked as a real estate agent to support her family, but her passion lies in helping animals. She knew that she needed to pursue a career that would not only make her happy, but make a difference in society and the animal world as well. Now, with her husband\u2019s support, she has decided that this is the time to start pursuing her dream. \r\n\r\nChristina decided to start a mobile pet grooming business. Her own money is just enough to buy a van but not enough to change it into a grooming facility. Christina did not qualify for a loan from a bank. A $9,976 Kiva loan from PACE will help her transform the van into a mobile pet grooming facility so that she can start working towards her dream. She also has a non-profit animal rescue organization and a non-profit animal hospital. The profit from this mobile pet grooming business will be used in those two organizations.

Desde hace 1 a\u00f1o, aprovechando su experiencia comercial, se dedica a la venta de mercanc\u00edas como art\u00edculos de aseo, como crema dental, jab\u00f3n calzado, champo y ropa en general. Ella para iniciar con este negocio lo hizo a trav\u00e9s de su familia,  que habita en Venezuela, desde donde se los env\u00edan a su tierra natal. Su meta mas adelante es tener su propio local en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus hermanos  y est\u00e1 pensando ubicarlo en la vivienda en la cual habita, pues esta se encuentra en una esquina, por donde suelen transitar muchas personas y ello potencializa su venta en un punto fijo.

Norma del Carmen thanks Kiva lenders for the support they offer low-income people in poor countries like Nicaragua to have decent work.
