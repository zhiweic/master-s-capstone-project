woman.  She is 37 years old and is married with four children at home.  Ziyoda's mother lives with them.  Since she has a very large family and supporting such a large family is difficult, Ziyoda decided to find her own source of income.  For a few years she has worked as a schoolteacher and her salary is not enough to support her family.  Her husband works in raising livestock and he has a great deal of experience in this field.  For this reason, Ziyoda has decided to start her own business raising animals, as her husband has promised to help her run her business.  With the goal of starting her business, she enrolled in the \"Get Ahead\" course offered by the Association of Businesswomen and earned a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She will buy a herd of livestock, look after it for a few months and sell them on at a higher price than she originally paid.  She is asking for a loan of 1,500 somoni to buy the livestock to start her new business.  She is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1265516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Teimuraz receives a small amount of income from his store, selling fruits and vegetables. As the existing income is not enough for the family, Teimuraz decided to start a new business. He plans to finish renovating an additional store and to rent it out for a good price. Teimuraz has applied for loans from local financial institutions several times, for a business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his lack of experience in the new business, as experience is usually a requirement of local credit providers. However, his loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-start credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. With this loan, Teimuraz will repair his newly built store and renovate it properly so that it satisfies the needs of his clients. Teimuraz hopes his business will be profitable and that this will increase his income, providing his family with enough money to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1265408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to renovate an additional store store to rent out.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Khashuri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-12-27T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-26T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teimuraz ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":86.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":112.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":109.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":113.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":113.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":117.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":120.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":124.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":129.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":130.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":139.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":138.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":142.65},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":144.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":153.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":163.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.3,"local_amount":86.3,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":86.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115664,"comment":null},{"amount":112.91,"local_amount":112.91,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":112.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861145,"comment":null},{"amount":109.1,"local_amount":109.1,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":109.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569950,"comment":null},{"amount":2891.69,"local_amount":2891.69,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2891.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968585,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-19T11:30:19Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:10:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512146,"name":"Urjinhand","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Urjinhand is 57 years old and lives with her husband and her son in their small house in Selenge province in Mongolia.

Since 1987 she has been growing strawberries, currants, grapes, and tomatoes, as well as raising cereal crops.  \r\nHer husband and her two adopted children, aged 10 and 11 years, help her with the farm.  She began the business growing onions and running an orchard where they have apricot, cherry, peach, pear, and apple trees.\r\n\r\nNataliya and her husband decided to buy equipment for a well and a pump since there are many problems with water for irrigation in their area, especially during the summer dry period, when they have to water the grape vines by hand.\r\n\r\nAmong her future plans are to expand her plantings with new varieties of grapes and raspberries, as well as to build a greenhouse for growing strawberries.

","en":"Eduardo is a cobbler and it is going well and this is thanks to his Kiva credit, combined with his capacity for work.  Upon accessing a loan he invested it in the purchase of materials like leather, soles and other materials.  He was able to get discounts and fabricate new designs that were sold very quickly.  The increase in his production helps improve his life and the dreams of his family.  These improvements are reflected in the well-being of his family.  He says to his financiers (Kiva lenders) that they should continue to help the small Colombian micro-businesses, so that they can meet their goals.  That is what Eduardo is grateful for.  Currently he is applying for a new Kiva loan with which he will purchase a display case in order to show off his new December designs, as well as to purchase material like leather, vinyl, glue, etc.  The quality with which he makes the shoes, which changes according to the season, is what makes the investment of Kiva credit so successful for Eduardo's shop.  Eduardo has plans for great success for him and his family and the loan will allow him and his family to have a happy Christmas season and to make many goals so that his 2013 new year will be prosperous.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":543.41,"image":{"id":1265654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase material like leather, vinyl, glue, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-27T15:51:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-26T15:51:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduardo Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1040000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":76099},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":77875},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":79692},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":81552},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83454},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":85402},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":87394},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":89434},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91520},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":93656},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":95841},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":98081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.9,"local_amount":76099,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":77905.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519848,"comment":null},{"amount":44.93,"local_amount":77875,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":79724.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071692,"comment":null},{"amount":45.98,"local_amount":79692,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":81584.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497906,"comment":null},{"amount":47.05,"local_amount":81552,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":83488.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527720,"comment":null},{"amount":48.14,"local_amount":83454,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":85435.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928469,"comment":null},{"amount":49.27,"local_amount":85402,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":87429.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967912,"comment":null},{"amount":102.02,"local_amount":176828,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-24T08:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":181026.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817110,"comment":null},{"amount":106.83,"local_amount":185176,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:26Z","rounded_local_amount":189572.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082637,"comment":null},{"amount":55.29,"local_amount":95841,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":98116.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731731,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-28T10:00:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512156,"name":"Zolboo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Zolboo is 24 years old and lives with her husband and newborn baby son in a ger (traditional Mongolian tent) in the Govisumber province of Mongolia.

She is a hardworking working and determined woman as well as being cheerful and friendly. She lives with Angel, who is a mason and father of her children that are already of age and independent. They live comfortably together in their own home.\r\n\r\nKelita sells different styles of shoes for women, men, and children. They are purchased in the city of Lima, thanks to the support of her friend that lives there that buys and sends them to her. Kelita then sells them to her family, friends, and neighbors. She attends to her customers in a kind way, managing to earn their business. She has more than 10 years dedicated to this business, and so far, she has done this alone.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her business since it generates an income and gives her an occupation. It also gives her time to be home to take care of their animals (chickens and ducks). She considers her business to be quite profitable, and therefore wants to increase her stock of goods and to make her business grow. On the other hand, she says that she know how to sew, and plans to buy a sewing machine and venture into that business to generate more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 12th loan with the institution MFP. She is very glad to know that she will have financial support, because she will feel safe in growing her business. On the other hand, she feels comfortable with her community bank, because she considers it a united group with solidarity.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 1200 nuevos soles ($475), she will invest it into buying a greater number of different styles of shoes in order to have a stock available for sale. She hopes to get them for less for purchasing in bulk.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1265658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy wholesale shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-27T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-26T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":178.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":189.47},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":199.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":202.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":212.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":217.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.71},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.71,"local_amount":178.64,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:34Z","rounded_local_amount":180.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573143,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":189.47,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":190.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122785,"comment":null},{"amount":78.92,"local_amount":199.37,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":200.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868608,"comment":null},{"amount":80.32,"local_amount":202.91,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":204.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577442,"comment":null},{"amount":83.95,"local_amount":212.09,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":213.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529679,"comment":null},{"amount":86.1,"local_amount":217.52,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":219.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974710,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-28T01:08:02Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":507607,"name":"Mehboob","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mehboob is a very hardworking and active borrower of Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan.

The area is affected by a poor road network that is impassable and inaccessible, especially during the rainy season when it floods. Nevertheless, Jackline is determined to increase her agricultural production and provide tuition for her children. She will use the loan to buy Irish potato seeds for planting.

38-year-old Annemarie from Kandeh town Bo. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 8 and 20 years old. One of her children is currently attending school. In 2003, Annemarie established her local food business. She began her business because she wants to generate a permanent source of income. She works at the business 6 days per week and 12 hours per day. She says that the main challenge to her business is the poor road network to her operation area.\r\n\r\nAnnemarie requires a loan in order to buy more local products like native rice and gallon palm oil. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her level of conditions. In the future, Annemarie plans to run an international business.

She is the mother of two children, 46 and 42 years old. She lives with them, her grandchildren, and her partner in their own home. They managed to build the home as a result of hard work and a lot of effort. She spends her days working in order to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRosa is mainly engaged in the sale of cosmetics, perfume, and personal grooming items, but also sells soft drinks. Her work begins in the mornings when she starts her journey through her neighborhood and the main streets of the city offering all of the products she has for sale. This is a way to get new customers and to keep the ones she already has. In the evenings, she goes back home and awaits the arrival of her customers and attends to them with cordiality while they buy perfume, cream, or other items. She sells soft drinks with the help of her grandchildren when she is not home. Her biggest selling hours are in the evenings since her daughter-in-law sells food and this is the perfect opportunity for those customers to consume refreshing beverages.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys what she does and being busy all day. She feels useful and has lots of energy to continue working for the good of her family. Now, she has many plans to improve the display of her products she sells from home, and for that she needs to buy some counters and other accessories.

He spent almost six years learning the tailoring trade before setting up on his own in a workshop near to the market. He manages to make reasonably regular income during the festival season and when school starts.

Luego ella hizo un esfuerzo para prepararse en algo adicional y estudi\u00f3 en una academia de belleza. Es soltera y tiene un hijo, para ella ha sido muy dif\u00edcil educar sola a su hijo, pero \u00e9l se ha convertido en la inspiraci\u00f3n de cada d\u00eda para salir adelante en su trabajo. Viven en Pastaza, un cant\u00f3n ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta ciudad. En cada negocio se encuentra personas que no se han dado por vencidas frente a la falta de empleo sino que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio para llevar una vida digna y hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os.\nGladys aprendi\u00f3 r\u00e1pido en la Academia de Belleza a la que asisti\u00f3 y tambi\u00e9n adquiri\u00f3 experiencia en esta actividad desde muy joven. Ahora tiene su propio Sal\u00f3n de Belleza que se ha convertido en el sustento para su hogar, negocio al cual le dedica 12 horas diarias con entusiasmo y esfuerzo, pues cree que el trabajo se lo realiza mejor cuando se lo disfruta. Paralelamente, Gladys atiende a su hijo y le ayuda con sus tareas. Ahora ella desea invertir en un producto natural que es el caf\u00e9 org\u00e1nico y saludable que tiene propiedades curativas y adelgazantes, entre otras. Todo esto porque la misi\u00f3n de la microempresa que ha establecido Gladys no es solo brindar servicios de peluquer\u00eda sino tambi\u00e9n de asesor\u00eda en est\u00e9tica y salud para sus clientes. Para esta inversi\u00f3n, Gladys requiere un cr\u00e9dito que le ayudar\u00e1 a ofertar y vender este producto y comprar algunas herramientas para su negocio y de esta forma, incrementar sus ingresos y poder brindar a su hijo la educaci\u00f3n hasta verlo convertirse en un profesional.

","en":"Gladys, 30, finished secondary school thanks to the help of her parents. Despite their scarce resources, they were able to give their daughter an education. Then she made an effort to do something else and studied in a beauty school. She is single and has one son. It has been very difficult for her to raise her son on her own, but now he has become her inspiration to advance in her work every day. They live in Pastaza, a canton in the province of the same name. It belongs to the Amazon region in the Republic of Ecuador. The main city in the canton is the city of Puyo, which is city located in the middle of the amazon jungle in the western part of Pastaza province, 924 meters above sea level. It's small, but it has several sites which are the favorites of domestic and international tourists, above all the sites for ecological activities and extreme sports. It's a city that grows every day because of its trade, ranching, agriculture, and tourism. Several branches of finance and trade companies have been established there to take advantage of the economic activity in the city. In every business, there are people who have not given up in the face of lack of employment, but rather have used their business ideas to live a dignified life and make their dreams a reality.\r\n\r\nGladys learned quickly at the beauty school she attended and she had experience in this field from the time she was young. Now she has her own beauty salon, which has provided for her home. She works 12 hours a day with enthusiasm and effort. She believes work is done better when it is enjoyed. At the same time, Gladys cares for her son and helps him with his homework. Now she wants to invest in a natural product - healthy and organic coffee that has curative and slimming properties, among others. This is because the mission of her small business is not only to provide hairdressing services, but to also give beauty and health advice to her customers. For this investment, she wants a loan that will help her to offer and sell this product and buy some tools for her business. This way, she can increase her income and give her son an education and see him become a professional. In addition to the council that her manager and Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa have given her, she learned to manage her goods in such a way that she can put part of her profits into a savings account. Over time, this will allow her to get her own house for the wellbeing of herself and her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1265017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to invest in the sale of healthy and organic coffee and to buy tools for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pastaza","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-12-27T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-26T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1584.6,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":111.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":124.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":127.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":127.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":130.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":131.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":133.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":137.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":139.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":141.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":143.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":113.05,"local_amount":111.96,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":113.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516834,"comment":null},{"amount":125.27,"local_amount":124.07,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":125.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068689,"comment":null},{"amount":129.05,"local_amount":127.8,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":129.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494956,"comment":null},{"amount":129,"local_amount":127.76,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":129,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524884,"comment":null},{"amount":1103.63,"local_amount":1093.01,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1103.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133188,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T21:26:22Z","paid_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512002,"name":"Timotea","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Timotea, se decidi\u00f3 por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo, porque necesita invertir en su negocio, adquiriendo un lote de medicinas y tambien prendas de vestir, como linazas, suplementos alimenticios, entre otros productos naturales, as\u00ed como ropa para ni\u00f1os, blusas y ropa interior.\nElla comenta que el pr\u00e9stamo anterior le permiti\u00f3 mejorar el negocio, fortaleciendo el inventario hoy en d\u00eda se ha trasladado a otra vivienda que es m\u00e1s amplia. \n","en":"Timotea opted to take out a new loan because she needs to invest in her business, buying a batch of medicines and clothing.

She has been a single mother since she was 17 and she has a 40-year-old daughter.  She lives alone in her own house.  Every day she puts all her effort into the things she does to continue her life and generate an income for herself.\r\n\r\nRosa's job is selling men's and women's clothing.  Generally she delivers on request on a regular basis, whether biweekly or monthly.  She has customers who order from her and she gets the garments from another city.  Her profits for this job are very good because the clothes she sells are quality brands made of good materials.  She has done this job for six years, and she says she has not received any complaints from her customers.\r\n\r\nLike any enterprising person, however, she also has another job, which is washing clothes.  She washes clothes by hand, mainly for police officers, and it's a trade she has been able to develop very well in the comfort of her home.  She has a physical condition in her legs that requires her to walk with crutches, and sometimes she needs help.  In spite of this, though, she generally works alone, and she continues working every day to earn her living with the sweat of her labor.\r\n\r\nShe likes what she does very much because she feels it shows people that one can always get ahead despite some difficulties.  Now she hopes to set up a business in her house and flourish in both jobs with greater efficiency and quality, having the necessary implements such as clothing display counters, mannequins, hangers, mirrors, a good washing machine, and other accessories.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with MFP.  She's very happy to know that again they're giving her the confidence to get ahead in her jobs and to continue enjoying the successes of her work.  She's also committed to being punctual with her monthly payments and working responsibly with the members of her communal bank, because they all are supportive people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 1200 soles [PEN] she'll buy merchandise so she can continue working: polo shirts, shirts, blouses, shorts, and pants for men and women.

She lives with Luis who is a merchant and the father of her children, all of whom are now independent and whom she loves very much. Together they live comfortably in a rented house in the company of her sister and her nephew. \r\n\r\nThe activity that Beatriz realizes is the sale of local fruits and refreshments of a variety of flavors. For this work she puts a table in front of her house everyday to accommodate her fruits. Her drinks are quite popular due to her friendly treatment and the good taste of her refreshments.\r\n\r\nShe began over two years ago with a loan from MFP, and up to now she has been working alone. Occasionally, her daughter helps her. Also, she considers her business quite profitable given the income it provides her and the good reputation which her business has.\r\n\r\nShe decided to start her business due to the necessity of finding a job to generate her own income. In addition, on occasion the income of her partner was not enough to support the family. She made the decision to support him, seeking to provide a better quality of life for their children.\r\n\r\nNow seeing the good results she has achieved, she wishes to continue with her business and to venture into the sale of groceries. For this she wants to open a mini market in her house.\r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with MFP. She is grateful for the financial support she will receive, which will help her feel more secure in advancing her plans. Additionally she notes that her communal bank is in good standing as it is considered a collaborative and responsible group. \r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 600 nuevos soles, she will invest in the purchase of soft drinks to stock her business, and also in assorted fruits; she will seek affordable prices for her purchases in order to have higher profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1265713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy soft drinks to stock her business and fruit to make refreshments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-27T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-26T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":91.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":95.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":108.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.26,"local_amount":91.83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":97.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573148,"comment":null},{"amount":39.69,"local_amount":95.25,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":101.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122790,"comment":null},{"amount":41.17,"local_amount":98.8,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868613,"comment":null},{"amount":41.46,"local_amount":99.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":105.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577447,"comment":null},{"amount":44.25,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":112.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529684,"comment":null},{"amount":45.17,"local_amount":108.42,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":115.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974715,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T18:26:37Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512325,"name":"Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santos   es un hombre agricultor de 34 a\u00f1os de edad.

His store is open from 5 in the morning and he takes it upon himself to attend to each one of his customers with much respect and eloquence. \r\n\r\nHe has had this business for around 1 year, though lamentably he still feels that the income that he gets from his sales is not enough to provide for his family a dignified life. For this reason, he continues his job of 9 years as a stevedore in the river port of the city, where he responsible for loading and unloading the boats and canoes that arrive full of goods and for this he receives a fair payment.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he started his business selling groceries he has had many difficulties - for example, the lack of capital to continue restocking his goods. Nonetheless with time he has improved this attitude and has learned to have patience and realize he is never alone in facing his problems since he can count on the support of his family at any moment.

He has been doing this for 14 years, from 4am to approximately 10pm every day of the year, and counts with the help of two family members. For the past 2 years he has also worked as a mototaxi driver in the evenings, but only when he is not too tired from his job as a fish salesman.\r\n\r\nHe really enjoys what he does because he feels he's helping to distribute the fish species that exist in the rivers of his city. He also enjoys promoting its preservation by rejecting and bringing to the authorities' attention situations where the fish is not suitable for consumption, either because of its size or because it's closed season. \r\n\r\nHe looks forward to exporting his products in larger quantities in the future.

Rosaura makes a living cooking and selling food items, which she prepares in her home and delivers to 15 construction workers who are on site near her house. She collects payments weekly from her customers.\r\n\r\nRosaura started her business on a very small scale over 10 years ago with her own savings. Her family needed her to generate additional income to help with household expenses, so she decided to launch a business from home. As demand for her food dishes continued to grow, Rosaura decided to move forward with her business. Her children now help her with food preparation and delivery, and she splits her profits with them. With years of experience under her belt, Rosaura is able to accurately estimate the amount of food that her customers need each day, and she therefore wastes very little food and is able to increase her profit margin. \r\n\r\nAs she continued to have success with her operation, Rosaura decided to expand her business. This will be her fourth loan with MFP, and she is grateful for the personal and financial support she has received from the institution. With the support from this loan, Rosaura plans to purchase kitchen utensils for her business, including bowls, plates, cups and other items to better serve her clients.

She uses half the day to work and make the clothing and the other half of the day to study.\r\n\r\nThanks to her own effort and that of her parents, she was able to finish her studies in school.  However, the lack of employment opportunities is widepread.  Because of this, she decided to take up this work independently, in order to be able to contribute to the economy and development of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has been manufacturing clothing for one year, and sees that her profits are good.  Currently, she wants to invest more capital in order to make better products.\r\n\r\nShe is the representative that took the initiative to form this group of young women who are now requesting a loan to grow their businesses.  She wants to buy threads of different colors and different qualities.\r\n\r\nThe other members are the two women on either side of her in the photo.  One of them also manufactures women's clothing, and the other has a business raising chickens.  They also will use part of this loan for their own businesses.  \r\n\r\nThey have a goal of continuing to invest and to have larger businesses in the future with better incomes for their families.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1210.43,"image":{"id":1265814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy materials for the manufacture of typical feminine clothing.

She is the mother of four children, ages seven, six, three, and one.  She lives with her children and partner of thirteen years; his name is Adriano.  They live in their own house and Adriano and Lleni spend their days working a lot in order to offer a better quality of life to their family.\r\n\r\nLleni's work involves a grocery store.  Her business has been located in her own home for approximately two years.  The house is on a very busy street in the city.  All of her customers go there every day in search of every type of typical product that Lleni has to offer.  She began this activity five years ago.  Before, she worked by selling door-to-door, but this was uncomfortable as she was also selling fish.  However, after a lot of effort she was able to establish her own store in her home.  For the moment, she is much more calm.  Possibly, she will alternate her work with being a cook, a job that will help to satisfy the hunger of the laborers.  \r\n\r\nWhen she began her business in her home, she had a lot of challenges, like the competition with other grocery shops that already existed in her neighborhood.  But with the passage of time, she was able to overcome this.  Now, her store is visited often, since she offers various products at comfortable prices.  She also treats her customers with kindness and above all, she opens her store very early and is always waiting with a smile for her customers.  \r\n\r\nShe likes what she does very much, since it allows her to be able to see her children in her house.  Her business is also going very well and is already generating a lot of income for her home.  She has many plans for her business, like expanding it and thereby being able to sell in larger quantities.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with the institution.  She is very happy for the financial support that she is receiving and for the confidence that the institution places in her to continue moving forward.  She is thankful for the advice she has received and is sure she will advance with the support of her communal group.  She thinks that all the members are responsible and caring people.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (1200 soles), she will buy three sacks of rice, two sacks of sugar, large boxes of milk, small cartons of milk, liters of oil, noodles, canned products, sausages, and other items consumed on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1265695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy three sacks of rice, two sacks of sugar, large boxes of milk, small cartons of milk, liters of oil, noodles, canned products, sausages, and other items consumed on a daily basis.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-27T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-26T21:00:06Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lleni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":183.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":190.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":197.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":198.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":212.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":217.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.64},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.64,"local_amount":183.52,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":184.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573146,"comment":null},{"amount":75.36,"local_amount":190.37,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":191.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122788,"comment":null},{"amount":78.16,"local_amount":197.46,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":199,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868611,"comment":null},{"amount":78.71,"local_amount":198.85,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577445,"comment":null},{"amount":84.02,"local_amount":212.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":213.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529682,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":217.55,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":219.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974713,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T22:35:53Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512392,"name":"Juan Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad es  casado  tiene un hijo vive con  en el Recinto ZAPOTAL NUEVO perteneciente al Cant\u00f3n Ventanas Provincia de Los R\u00edos. \n\nPertenece a la Ventanilla LOS AMIGOS se encuentra ubicada el  recinto ZAPOTAL NUEVO  , perteneciente al cant\u00f3n Ventanas se dedica a labores agr\u00edcolas y pecuarias. \n\nJuan se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de maiz y la crianza de animales de corral como pollos y patos.

This has made her very well-known in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nSeeing that this is a good season for all of the merchants in the area, she doesn't want to miss out.

This is not only a family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue business operations, she requests a loan of 12,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy additional stocks of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products.

He has the satisfaction of having given the best of himself to his children, who are professionals today, forging a better life for them than he had when we was young. With the fruit of his effort, he was able to finish building his house from hard-wearing materials, and he lives there alone. For almost 30 years, he worked as a trader, selling clothes and footwear for all ages. There were times when the political violence in the country caused his life and business to take a turn, but despite that, he has always had the desire to work and advance, being able to ignore the problems of those times and turn his business today into a great means to maintain his family. He likes his work a lot because he is very proud of what he has achieved with God's help. He also mentions the peacefulness of working and moving forward. Among the current demand for his business are clothing for men. He complements this business with the sale of backpacks and children's shoes. Nevertheless, school time is when the sale of footwear for students of all ages gives him a good income. To grow his current business, he wants to have capital to stock his business with clothing and children's shoes. He also wants to save capital to buy school shoes and take advantage of that season's demand. With the 3,500 nuevos soles he is applying for, he hopes to stock his business with the purchase of slippers and other children's shoes as well as save money for the next school season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1265917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy slippers and children's shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-28T03:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-27T03:00:10Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":377.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":406.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":414.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":447.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":450.42},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":477.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":505.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":148.37,"local_amount":377.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":377.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573165,"comment":null},{"amount":159.83,"local_amount":406.85,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":406.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122807,"comment":null},{"amount":165.09,"local_amount":420.24,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":420.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868630,"comment":null},{"amount":162.96,"local_amount":414.8,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":414.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577464,"comment":null},{"amount":175.89,"local_amount":447.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":447.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529701,"comment":null},{"amount":176.95,"local_amount":450.42,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":450.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974732,"comment":null},{"amount":385.91,"local_amount":982.31,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":982.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996061,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-30T04:17:07Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512426,"name":"Maura Yadira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maura Yadira tiene 33 a\u00f1os  vive en uni\u00f3n libre tiene tres hijos.

She has been separated for many years and has six adult children on their own.  She has not had an easy life, but she continues forward.  Lia sells snacks, beer, and general groceries.  She also sells vegetables and set up a small store in the front part of her house, where she sells all types of products and works every day.  Her small store is very well visited by her customers because it\u2019s the only place in the neighborhood that sells a variety of products.  She is known for being charismatic and in a good mood.\r\n\r\nThis activity has made her neighbors like her and her sales have increased, giving her income that she needs.  The family expenses that she had to cover were her reason for developing this business.  She\u2019s been doing this for five years and does it alone.  At first she thought that she would never be able to have a business in her own home because she sold snacks on foot all over the city, but she didn\u2019t sell much and got frustrated.  This has changed and now she is more relaxed and puts much effort into selling from the store she set up.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is talking to her customer and making them laugh.  She thinks that the most difficult thing is having to get up so early, however she knows that this brings her good financial results at the end of the day.  She would love to have a store from where she could sell all of her products in quantity.  This will be her 2nd loan through MFP and she is grateful to those who make this loan possible so that she can continue toward her objective.  She is also very committed to making her payments responsibly and is very happy to belong to her communal bank, where all its members are good, friendly, and united.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the 1,200 PEN from this loan to buy snacks and groceries in bulk to stock her store and continue selling constantly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1265754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-28T04:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-27T04:20:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":178.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":189.36},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":197.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":198.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":213.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":222.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.1},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.55,"local_amount":178.22,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":179.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573153,"comment":null},{"amount":74.95,"local_amount":189.36,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":190.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122795,"comment":null},{"amount":78.1,"local_amount":197.3,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":198.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868618,"comment":null},{"amount":78.68,"local_amount":198.77,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577452,"comment":null},{"amount":84.67,"local_amount":213.92,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":215.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529689,"comment":null},{"amount":88.05,"local_amount":222.43,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":224.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974720,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-28T06:09:16Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512201,"name":"Tuna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tuna is a differently-abled 23-year-old single man.

with routinely joining two uneven picnic tables as a pseudo poker table when entertaining his friends and family, Eric decided to take his construction experience and create a custom poker table for himself, eventually creating M\u2019s Custom Poker Tables.\r\n\r\nHe shares his experiences on his company website:  \u201cI built my very first table by trial and error, and it turned out well. Then, I started building table after table and I got better at it. I quickly progressed and everyone noticed,\u201d he writes.  \u201cI began to receive calls and drop-ins at my house by people who had heard about the tables and wanted to see them. I looked to see if there was anybody else building poker tables in the Valley, and I found out there was no one local to buy from. So, I got the idea to start building and selling my own custom tables.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow 32-year-old Eric creates handmade custom poker tables to sell to discerning customers. Options include any color of cloth, accompanied by dropped-in or swivel brass, bronze, chrome or aluminum cup holders, a variety of wooden or chrome table legs, armrests and wood stains.   Eric will also deliver and set up the tables he creates.\r\n\r\n\u201cOther companies may \"cut and paste\" their work,\u201d Eric says, \u201cBut I\u2019m professional. My tables are nice, the designs are nice, and compared to competitors, mine are something that attracts friends to play. I have more than eight different designs for different needs.\u201d  One of his designs even doubles as a dining room table, featuring a removable cover so it can easily convert for an after-dinner card game!\r\n\r\nCurrently, Eric works with Texas Poker Supplies in Austin to obtain his accessories, but he hopes to one day cut the costs of that middleman, purchase accessories at wholesale prices, and keep them in stock at his home where he works alone. He also occasionally hires helpers when he receives large orders and he will eventually hire a permanent part-time employee.

I asked a friend to make a website and ever since I promote Nazava Water Filters to friends, colleges and people that I meet.\" \n\n\"The prospect of this business is very good. Slowly but surely the mindset of people regarding how to obtain drinking water is changing. Instead of boiling water, which is expensive and a hassle, people more and more accept the technology of Nazava. My ambition is to sell more water filters and increase my profit so that my family can live more comfortable. I also wish that people will know me as a green technology activist and water filter salesmen.\u201d\n\nWith help of KIVA credit Mr. Aziz can have a larger stock with a larger variety of filters. Subsequently he will place advertisements in local newspapers and will also try to advertise Nazava through the local radio stations.

","en":"Kishimkan is 59 years old, she is a widow and a mother of seven children. After the collapse of the USSR Kishimkan has received a part of her land. She has been doing animal husbandry and field crop cultivation since 1991 as a main source of income for her family. After her husband's death the entire business has been left to herself and thanks to her son and daughter Kishimkan has been keeping all in order. The business which was started with an amount of 1,000 KGS in 1992 right now has six cows, twenty heads of sheep, 25 goats and three horses which brings around 10,000-12,000 som a month thanks to her hard work and perseverance. With the goal to further grow her business Kishimkan has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 30,000 KGS to buy cattle. She plans to use the received profit from selling the cattle in the fall to build a large shed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1266103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

First of all she will repay the loan amount to Kiva and then she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is too congested. She hopes that her business grows more and she is very much thankful to both Brac and Kiva. Note: In the picture, Ghazala is carrying a passbook in her hand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1174.81,"image":{"id":1266186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":" to purchase more cosmetic products like makeup kits, facial creams, hair styling products etc. for her beauty salon.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times

With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer. With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.

is a 60-year-old widow who lives in Surami with her son, daughter-in-law, grandson and retired mother-in-law. Several times, Makvala has requested loans from local financial institutions for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly income earned by Makvala, who is involved in the food trading business. She buys pies from the local bakery and sells them at the railway station for a profit. According to the government's estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category and they get monthly social assistance.\r\n\r\nMakvala requested a loan from Credo to start up her own business and sell clothing herself. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, for they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Makvala will purchase clothes for wholesale prices and resell them in her district for a profit.

She is a widow with 4 children; the youngest is the only one still in school.\r\n\r\nPamela has requested a loan of 60,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to help her set a zero-grazing unit (confined area for lifestock, to prevent disease) and buy a chaff cutter (a machine that cuts hay into smaller pieces to be mixed with feed and fed to lifestock).  \r\n\r\nShe says her improved farming income will enable her to educate her youngest child.  She remains optimistic that she will eventually buy a vehicle to ease transportation of her produce to the market.\r\n\r\nPamela says lack of proper development for the local markets is a major challenge, coupled with pests and diseases.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1266268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone.

The increased profit will be reinvested in the clothing trading business to increase her stock and sales volume. The family members will be able to earn some savings and buy their own house.

He will buy products in East Georgia at wholesale prices and sell them at a good price in his district. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income for the family. Their living conditions will improve, and in the future, they will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1303.21,"image":{"id":1266426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

The business began ten years ago and she still dedicates herself to the same work.  The work schedule is from 5:00 am to 5:00 pm.  The only disadvantage is the time that she invests in the business is time she cannot devote to her son.  The loan that Terla seeks is needed to invest in merchandise like: sandals, and shoes for men and lotions.  With the help of this loan she will be able to stock her business and this will help her to increase her sales and earn more in order to buy medicine for her son.  Terla's goal is to improve the condition of her business and enlarge the store.  This is her second line of credit with FAMA and has always made her payments on time.

After two successive expansions, Pablo now farms around 1,000 cacao trees spread out over four acres of lowlands. His wife Victoriana and four live-in children are of major help at harvest time, as the family tends to work their own cacao instead of hiring outside help. Pablo\u2019s family members are multilingual and speak both their native Maya Mopan as well as English.\n\nFarming was something Pablo was born into and embraced out of the need to support his family. He is happy to be able to offer his children the option of a high school education, which in Belize is both optional and comes at a high cost. Two of Victoriana and Pablo\u2019s children are currently in school, and one has opted to follow in Pablo\u2019s footsteps and work the land for a living.  \n\nBesides cacao, Pablo grows the traditional crops of beans, rice and corn, but is also experimenting with multi-cropping by planting fruit trees among his cacao and timber trees that provide the necessary shade and nutrients for both.  \n\nAs most of the family\u2019s income comes from cacao, their wellbeing rests on continuous efforts to maintain and grow yields. Pablo is requesting this loan to set up an individual nursery of 500 seedlings that will be transplanted in six months\u2019 time to expand his farm. In order to increase yields and shorten the period before the new trees become productive, Pablo will use grafting. So-called side-grafting means implanting a bud into the trunk of more mature seedling, a technique that requires utmost precision and on average results in around 75 percent success rate.
