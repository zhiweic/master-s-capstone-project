This is his story:\r\n\r\nI have been working in Tanzania with my wife for four years now, and I have been using my previous project management experience to help in the development of new projects in this rural part of Tanzania. We have a son living in Sweden and a daughter back in Australia. The very limited access to electricity supply, especially in remote areas such as Kagera, means that solar lighting presents opportunities for people to study and work in the evenings, helping to reduce poverty. They also avoid the need to use dangerous kerosene lamps, reducing costs, improving health and reducing the risk of fires. A large part of my work for the Anglican Church over the last year was starting a retail business to sell solar lights locally and distribute them to micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses who want to sell them in villages. We have also trained new staff and provided employment locally and aim to develop a self-sustaining enterprise. \r\n\r\nWatu na Nuru needs to have sufficient quantities of the right products at the best time of year (when farmers bring in their harvest). We need funds to ensure product is available when people are ready to buy it. We have developed a partnership with Barefoot Power Australia, who make what we believe are the best micro-solar systems on the market. When we are not selling product, we provide training and technical support to retailers and micro-entrepreneurs because we want to ensure these lights continue working for years. My greatest challenge in this role is maintaining supply lines to the remote areas in a region the size of Rwanda. Your loan will support our stock so that more village entrepreneurs can sell these lighting solutions.

She began her business because she needed to  earn her living. \n\nWorking 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,200,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Hawa requires a loan in order to buy 11 bags of beans @ Le,450,000 and will use Le 50,000 for transportation. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 429,000. Hawa is excited about the loan and she is planning to expand her business. Honest and hard-working, she thanks you for your support.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1113571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy 11 bags of beans @ Le, 450,000 and the Le 50,000 for transportation.

This area is known for its abundance of plant and animal life due to the tropical weather conditions and the presence of a dense rain forest.  The residents of this province have made considerable progress, thanks in part to the creation of various access roads that lead to the river.

With VisionFund's assistance, she now earns approximately 18,000 KHR per day, and she manages to save approximately 8,000 KHR per day. She is now leading her group in applying for a loan in the amount of 500,000 KHR each (1,000,000 KHR total).

The main challenge of her family\u2019s business is the lack of working capital. <p>\r\n\r\nTeuy has been with VisionFund for five loan cycles, while her group members have been with VisionFund for one to five cycles. She successfully repaid the prior loans, which helped her to better support both her family and her business. To address her business challenges, she is leading her group of four to apply for another loan with VisionFund in the amount of 500,000 KHR each (2,000,000 KHR total). As the leader, she plans on using her portion of the loan proceeds to purchase fertilizers and to plow her land. She hopes to grow more rice and to thereby earn additional income so that she can afford to buy a new television for her family.

However, the family primarily earns a living through agricultural activities.  They have two milking cows and a calf.  They produce cheese and sell it on the local open market.

She gets her supplies from a region in Benin. \r\n\r\nSeeking to satisfy her customers and to increase her sales and her revenues, Victoire, along with the other members of the group WADAGBE, is requesting an initial loan from ALID\u00e9. This loan will surely enable them to raise their business level and to make more profit.

He is a farmer who has been growing tobacco for 15 years. He went to school up to junior high school, and is now the father of five grown-up children. He says his first loan was a great help because it could cover the cost of supplies and the rental of land to grow tobacco, which generated a good crop. His first loan was used for the purchase supplies and labour payment so that he was able to sow five manzanas (8.6 acres) of tobacco. He wants to improve production and offer better quality produce this year, which is why today he requires a second loan. This time he will invest in the repair and maintenance of a tobacco-drying gallery. This will help him improve the quality of his produce, and the development is supported by his children as well as by Kiva. He hopes to have the support of Kiva to keep your business growing, to cover the tobacco production costs, generate more income and to move forward with his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1119216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To invest in the repair and maintenance of a tobacco-drying room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T06:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T06:40:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Valentin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373166193,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-20T04:46:02Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":439754,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan works hard to support her family.

For the past 15 years, Stanly has been working hard to manage his production business, after which he can sell dry food like maize flour, and also has a milling machine. \n\nTo help expand his business, Stanly has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more dry food like maize for resale and will help Stanly to generate greater profits and pay her school fees for his children. Stanly hopes that in the future he will be able to educate his children up to the university level. \n\nStanly is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

She is 54 years old.  Aurora is a very hard-working person who strives to provide for her children and offer them with a better life.  She uses her old artisanal oven and bundles of firewood to try and earn a daily living.\r\n\r\nAurora has been making bread and 'rosquillas' (a type of doughnut) for 25 years.  She only studied up to the fifth year of her primary education as her family's financial situation didn't allow her to continue.  Aurora is the mother of five children, two of whom are still in her care.  She started out in this business when she was very young, helping her mom who worked in the same business.  In this way, she gained experience and skill.  After she got married, she decided to work for herself.  At the age of 29, she set up her own business selling 'rosquillas', 'rosquetes' (a type of large doughnut) and bread.  \r\n\r\nThrough her hard work and effort, Aurora now has regular customers who come to her modest home to buy her products.  She has the support of her children who help her to make her bread and 'rosquillas'.  She also has additional income which her husband makes working for a company and which he puts towards their household expenses.  Aurora sells her products in her own community and also to itinerant vendors in the area though she would love to be able to sell them to the supermarkets because they pay a better price.\r\n\r\nAurora would like to be able to diversify the products that she sells in order to meet her customers' needs.  She is requesting this loan to buy raw materials such as corn, cheese and salt, the supplies she needs for making her 'rosquillas'.  She believes that the loan will be helpful as she will be able to make her products well and deliver them on time to her customers.  This will make her more profits.  Her future plans are to improve her home, be in a better financial position, and get ahead  in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1119200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy raw materials such as corn, cheese and salt","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurora Del Rosario \t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":848,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":70.67,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-21T08:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":70.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613468,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":70.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-19T08:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":70.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452940,"comment":null},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":70.67,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":70.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308448988,"comment":null},{"amount":92.03,"local_amount":91.81,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":92.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443849,"comment":null},{"amount":81.02,"local_amount":80.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":81.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048797,"comment":null},{"amount":79.82,"local_amount":79.63,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":79.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005958,"comment":null},{"amount":384.62,"local_amount":383.72,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":384.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568742,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-21T08:03:38Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":439279,"name":"Isezerano Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Goreth  fait partie du groupe Isezerano et  habite \u00e0 Gitega.

is Crisanta, 50, a  resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is a married to Bonifacio, her business partner, and they have one child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCrisanta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 21,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCrisanta dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1120867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay

is from Akhmeta District, East Georgia. She is 48 years old, unmarried, and lives with her mother and two nieces (12 and 14 years old). The children go to school. Her sister lives and works abroad to assist the family financially, and Maguli takes care of her pensioner mother and nieces. She has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for buying a business, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected every time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a milk cow. Maguli produces yogurt and sells it in the village. Also the family gets a small amount of financial assistance from Maguli\u2019s sister. The total average monthly income of the family doesn\u2019t exceed 400 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a four-member family. According to Credo estimations, Maguli\u2019s family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nMaguli requested a loan from Credo to start a small business. Her loan request was approved via the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program includes business start-up and re-startup loans with conditions appropriate for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nMaguli already has constructed a building for the grocery store in front of the family home. With the loan, she will purchase inventories for the store and meet her first customers. Maguli will work as a salesperson herself. She will sell a variety of grocery products, including dairy products from their cow. She is sure that the store will function profitably, as there are no similar stores nearby. The new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy daily needs, in order to improve their living conditions.

The city is in the process of growth resulting from ecotourism in the area.  The main attraction is \"La Cascada Azul\" (The Blue Waterfall), which is located 140 kilometers from the capital of Quito.\r\n<p>\r\nDespite its geographical location in the Ecuadorian mountains, Puerto Quito experiences weather that is very similar to that along the coast.  Since it is located in a tropical rain forest, the highest temperatures in the province reach approximately 25\u00b0C.  The temperature and the atmospheric conditions provide a suitable environment for the cultivation of tropical products.  \r\n<p>\r\nPatricia decided to grow cacao since it is a tradition that was passed on to her by her father.  For the past four years, she and her husband have managed a plantation where they grow and harvest cacao.  This 25-year-old entrepreneur strives each day to move her family forward.  She lives with her two-year-old son and her husband \u00c1ngel, age 28, who helps each day with the work around their plantation.  Patricia spends around six hours each day looking after her cacao plants.  After her work day is finished, she focuses on taking care of her family.  She enjoys spending time with them and sharing unforgettable moments.  Her plantation is located almost 10 minutes from her house, so it is easy for her to get to work.  The most difficult part of the production process is the fumigation of the plants.  Not only is the cost of the supplies she uses expensive, but so are the costs of labor and providing transportation around the plantation.  \r\n<p>\r\nPatricia hopes to increase the production on her property by purchasing more seeds and fertilizers in order to generate more income.  She dreams of having a better quality of life and providing the best for her family.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1118733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers.

is a 29-year-old single lady.

Three years ago, she started a small business selling mobile phone recharges, but as time passed she has been able to expand into a variety store where she sells products to meet daily basic needs such as snacks, sugar, coffee, and mineral water, along with mobile phone recharges. Munira makes the largest profit from selling mobile phone recharges as she already has many customers. She usually orders a mobile phone recharge of 3,000,000 IDR that will sell out within a week. Munira is thinking of adding more capital into her business especially the mobile phone recharges. \r\n\r\nMunira is requesting a 5,000,000 IDR loan from TLM to buy more credit recharges along with

She also equipped a small store where she offers all kinds of groceries and basic household products.  Every day she serves her customers from very early in the morning and with a great deal of kindness.  She has been working in this business for one year and sometimes receives support from her sister-in-law.  Mar\u00eda enjoys what she does as it allows her to work from home and also have time free so that she can look after her young daughter.  In addition, it gives her extra income which allows her to support her partner with their household expenses.  She would like to continue making progress in this way so that she can provide her daughter with a better quality of life.  As things are going well, she has plans to continue developing her business and to increase the range of products she sells.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's third loan from MFP and she is very happy to know that she has financial support because it makes her feel more certain of being able to make progress in her work.

She is a very hardworking woman with a big desire to better herself. She is currently separated from the man with whom she shared her days for a lot of years, she has 9 children, who are all grown up. She lives in a house of her own, which she got as a result of her relationship and shares it with just one of her daughters. They both put a lot of effort into trying to have a comfortable life. She fishes for a living. In order to do it, she has a small boat equipped with the necessary tools and accessories. She fishes in areas that are close to the city or in some rivers of which she already knows the resources that they carry. She directs her work towards obtaining the species that are consumed the most, those that are of the largest sizes and those that are better priced in the market, always respecting the close season of the species that are in danger of extinction or in reproductive period. When she has the fish, she sells it in her locality's central market herself, and with the help of some of her children. She sells at wholesale, to temporary or street vendors. She has been doing this for 40 years and acknowledges that it is a very profitable activity for the revenue that it generates. Also, she likes doing it, because it is her source of income. She says that thanks to this trade she has been able to lead a quiet and comfortable life. For this reason, she has plans to venture into the business of river transportation of passengers, and plans to build a special boat for this activity. This is her loan number 7 with MPF, which is why she is thankful for the people who make it possible for her to pursue her goals. On the other hand, she is very committed, once again, to make her repayments on time, as she did before. And she is very happy to be a part of her communal bank, since all the members are very kind, nice and supportive people. The amount requested (S\/. 2000) will be invested into making small repairs to the boat she currently owns and will make a down payment to get the other boat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1119680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to fix her current boat and make a down payment to purchase a new one","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T19:40:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paquita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":311.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":302.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":329.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":341.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":347.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":367.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":230.28,"local_amount":614.09,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":614.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401969,"comment":null},{"amount":123.55,"local_amount":329.45,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":329.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456244,"comment":null},{"amount":128.15,"local_amount":341.73,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":341.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451908,"comment":null},{"amount":130.38,"local_amount":347.69,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":347.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447083,"comment":null},{"amount":137.64,"local_amount":367.04,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":367.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052989,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-12T05:19:06Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":439907,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kamwenge in the Fort Portal region of Uganda.

is a 40-year-old married woman who is responsible for five school-aged children, residing in Baray district, Kompong Tom province. She has operated a farming business to supplement her husband\u2019s income. She cultivates rice and potato crops betweem the two seasons of the year, earning around USD $5.00 per day on average. She is an industrious farmer who always takes care of her crops in the field in order to ensure a high production so that she can send all of her children to school.

It has proven profitable, despite sometimes the impact of the extreme winter weather conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is Ana\u2019s second time applying for a loan. She has proven to be a very responsible person, which is why VisionFund Albania considered lending to her again this time. She wants to plant garlic seedlings in the land that she and her in-laws own. The family has been in the agricultural business, planting potatoes, ever since the collapse of the communist era, dating 20 years back. Ana is seeking Kiva lenders\u2019 understanding in this matter.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1121019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy
