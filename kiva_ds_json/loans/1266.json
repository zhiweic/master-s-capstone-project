Because of his family's economic circumstances, he was unable to get a higher education. Instead, he stayed in his hometown after graduation and started to work in order to take care of his large family.\n\nNozimjon has rented a booth where he currently sells SIM cards, phone panels, chargers as well as other phone replacement components.  However, he has never abandoned his dream of becoming a camera operator one day.  He now has the opportunity to make his dream come true.  He wants to buy a camcorder and start offering video services.  He plans to make videos at weddings, ceremonies, national holidays and various other events.\n\nIn Tajikistan, most celebrations and festivities are held on weekends.  Therefore, Nozimjon intends to work on Saturdays and Sundays.  On week days, he plans to edit his video recordings and continue to sell SIM cards.  Working as a cameraman and filming various events is not only Nozimjon's old dream, but it should also be a profitable activity.\n\nUnfortunately, Nozimjon doesn't have enough money to buy a camcorder.  A professional video camera is expensive and purchasing one costs a lot of money, which is the reason why he is taking a loan.

He has much experience in this field and established his business in 2006. Habib is well-known in the surrounding area, with an excellent reputation.\r\n\r\nHabib is requesting a loan of 3,000 USD. This loan will be used to install a shelter for his shop and to expand his pond in order to increase the number of fish in it. Habib is aiming to grow his business and increase his profits so he may continue providing his family\u2019s income and the tuition fees of his children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1471463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to install a shelter for his shop and to expand his pond in order to increase the number of fish in it","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":166,"posted_date":"2013-11-18T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-17T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Habib ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439707091,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T17:48:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":633339,"name":"Zhibek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zhibek is a first-year student of the American University of Central Asia, department of International and Business Law.

For this, I must say thanks to my whole family for motivation and support. Graduates have a difficult choice. They must make the right decision about what they exactly want from life. This starts from choice of faculty, university and even a country where they want to study. I think everyone in our country and even in Central Asia dreams about studying at AUCA. My dream is to study at AUCA also. From early childhood, I was interested in law because of movies. I was inspired by things that I have seen. People who work in this area are like freedom fighters. In their behavior, they can be a little bit aggressive because in some moments you will need to be like that because in my life I have seen lots of injustice to humans. To become a highly qualified specialist, I chose AUCA, as there are highly qualified professors, who work with modern system. All the classes are taught in English. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to its student and one of them is Kiva loans. I would like to apply for a Kiva loan as my family is not able to cover my tuition fees fully. With the loan, I will be able to cover my tuition fully and dedicate myself to my studies to become a highly qualified specialist.\u201d

This is the region with coffee, tea, and dairy farming. It is also the region that has had a lot of problems with deforestation. Monica is one of the many women who use wood and dung fuels for cooking and kerosene for lighting. Their income levels do not enable them to install and sustain electricity. Their life is hardened by the fact that the forests are preserved and hence it is not easy to get wood. Monica suffers every weekend walking up and down the hills to go fetch water and collect enough wood to last her the week so that she can do other duties during the weekdays.\r\n\r\nShe learned about VEP and the biogas project at the community training and from some of their promotional materials. Determined to resolve the fuel issue, she approached VEP to help her construct a biodigester (a device that turns organic waste into methane fuel) at her home. She has received a biogas loan and started the lifechanging project that will empower her and her family with cleaner, cheaper, and more efficient fuel. This will also save her one day in her weekends to rest and be with her children. The biogas will also supply her with light so she will not need to buy kerosene anymore. This will be good for her children who need to study in the evening and can now enjoy more study hours. We believe this will improve their grades. With the monthly income from tea and sale of milk from her three cows, Monica will be able to repay the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":48.96,"image":{"id":1468787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To construct a biodigester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-11-18T06:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-17T06:20:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4159}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.96,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4191.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867628,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T09:12:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":632593,"name":"Juana Herenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Herenia tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad,  vive en el distrito de Lagunas, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura y comercio de animales menores, a dos horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nElla se dedica a la venta de abarrotes  en su peque\u00f1a bodeguita y en la parte posterior cr\u00eda patos, gallinas y pavos, es una mujer emprendedora ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 2 000 nuevos soles  para la compra de v\u00edveres, verduras y frutas para abastecer su negocio y de esta manera generar mayores ingresos para una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"Herenia is 46 years old.

He was born in Pujil\u00ed, which is in the province of Cotopaxi. This canton is known as the Musical Emporium of Ecuador. Here most of its residents like music a lot and make this art a way of life. \r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacle in his life has been not being able to finish his education, and he only finished primary school. His mother wasn't able to have the resources necessary to give and education to Luis and his siblings. Since he was very young, they have done farm work and cared for animals (cows, pigs, sheep, chicken, etc.) to pay for the household expenses. That is why Luis, with all of the experience he has now, works buying and selling sheep. With this, he has been able to be a great moral and financial support for his family. His wife is the one who helps him most of the time. He has never given up and despite all of the need he has gone through he has been a fighter. He works four or five hours a day two days a week. The rest of the time he does agricultural work, caring for his crops.\r\n \r\nFor Luis it is difficult to transport his animals to the different markets in the city, since the sector he lives in has hills and mountains so it is very difficult to get his animals out. Today he is asking for a loan to buy a dairy cow, which will be a big help to improve his income. Luis has been able to get his wife and children ahead. They are his biggest pride and that is why he is very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making growth possible in his work and personal life.

As part of the Focal Point of Achacachi, it consists of eight members and is run by a board of directors where Se\u00f1ora Rosa is president.  The group members carry out various businesses, among them: selling cattle, knitting sweaters, knitting blankets, selling stucco, selling electronics, and selling fruit.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they are taking out will benefit small microenterprises, one of which is Se\u00f1ora Rosa\u2019s.  She says that this is the first time that she has joined Pro Mujer, signing up due to an invitation from an institutional promoter who went to visit her in her home.

This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her household as much as possible since she is married and has five children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked if she liked Pro Mujer, Adelia replied that she liked the savings and the education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":833.91,"image":{"id":1462907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-11-18T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-17T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":3625,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulogia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2837.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2993},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3075.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3159.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3245},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3334.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3442.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":411.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":422.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":433.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":445.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":499.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":411.37,"local_amount":2837.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2842.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615417,"comment":null},{"amount":422.54,"local_amount":2914.04,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2919.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736362,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T22:51:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":633394,"name":"John Bosco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John Bosco is 41 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the  region of Fortportal in Uganda.

She is mother of a single child. The child is too young for receiving education. Her husband is 45 years old and he is involved in a job as a caretaker in a private farm. \r\n\r\nManashi always tries to give financial support to her husband and family.For that reason she started her saree (a kind of Indian dress) business. She sells sarees door-to-door. But due to lack of capital she could not buy many varieties of sarees and hence her sales were also not satisfactory.

She is applying for a loan that she will use to pay school expenses.  Here's her story: My name is Luisa and I am 43 years old.  I was born and raised in San Joaquin.  Most of the people there, Dominicans and Haitians, work temporary jobs at the local sugar refinery.  My mother is a house keeper.  We are 5 siblings, of which I'm the oldest.  My father died some time ago.  I am now studying nursing at the Universidad Eugenio Maria de Hostos.  I want to develop my skills so that I can help anyone needs me, bandaging wounds and doing everything that I can to relieve the suffering of whoever God puts in my path.  \n\nI am in the middle of my eighth semester.  The focus of my classes are occupational heath, preventative care, Intra community health and hospital work.  I hope to finish school without having to worry about having enough money to pay for it.  Thanks to Kiva and FUNDAPEC and my own hard work, I'll be able to do it.  \n\nThe way to reach your goals is hard work.  I want to set an example for my brothers and sisters and in the future, for my children.

feet\"."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

If I don't obtain this loan, I will not be able to continue studying, since I don't have a job, and what my parents earn barely gives us enough to survive.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to train as a doctor,
