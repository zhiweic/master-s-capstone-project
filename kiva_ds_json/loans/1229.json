Her four loans from Nor Horizon Siranush have been successfully paid back and she waits for this loan impatiently to enlarge her farm.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":160.29,"image":{"id":1440445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy several piglets and fodder.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Gavar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2013-10-05T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-04T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Siranush","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18980},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21600},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21900},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22430},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":22050},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":23450},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23530},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23630},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":23570},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24430},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24410},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24740},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25220},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25160},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":26130},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":26120},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":26380},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27090},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27280},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27630},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27950},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28370},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":28660},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":29290}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.8,"local_amount":19521.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":19806.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420145434,"comment":null},{"amount":55.37,"local_amount":22150,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":22473.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429601437,"comment":null},{"amount":56.12,"local_amount":22450,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":22778,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439828404,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T21:15:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":613144,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 34 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda.

40-year-old Fatmata from Jui eastern area in Freetown.

She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and the high cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase more green vegetable leaves to expand her business.

In addition to school activities, she helps with the various chores at home and in the field. Iris learned agricultural skills from her parents. From a very young age, she helped attend to the coffee plants. Her crops are located in her community, about a half hour walk away.

Her husband works in a cotton-processing factory as a press operator, whereas Muhabbat bakes flatbread in a bakery and sells it at a local market.  She is currently a tenant on a 2-hectare plot of land where she grows rice.  \r\n\r\nLately, Muhabbat has been thinking it would be a good idea to start raising livestock at home.  She has no previous experience doing so, but her neighbors do, and are willing to help her if need be; nearly two-thirds of the population in Spitamen raise livestock.  Muhabbat will be using her own money to build a cow shed and buy cattle feed for her new business, and hopes to use a loan to buy cattle (4 cows and 4 calves).

She is married to Salvador, a messenger, and they have children who are all in school. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are both working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nCharina Rosario is an egg retailer. What she basically does is buy egg from wholesalers and then sells them with a little profit. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices she offered. She also has a variety store for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nCharina Rosario is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 25,000 that she will use to purchase additional stocks of eggs. She will also use the loan in buying grocery items and toiletries for her variety store.\r\n\r\nCharina Rosario hopes to be successful in life and business and dreams that her children will finish their studies.

Thanks to Ainura's persistent work, her farm currently has two dairy cows, a mare, 10 sheep and also a plot of land of 1.18 hectares. Here she grows peppers, potatoes and clover every year.

This is the first loan he has gotten from Emprender. Jose will use this loan to invest in the purchase of supplies and work materials for his business. He will also buy a sewing machine. The reason he is applying for this loan is because he lacks cash. Mr. Jose faces challenges in his business as he currently lacks a suitable workshop and depends on the sewing rooms of others to finish his work.

Asylkan has vocational training, and has been involved in livestock production as her main source of income, starting with one cow that she purchased 20 years ago for 5,000 Kyrgyzstani som (KGS). Thanks to Asylkan's hard work, her farm now contains two cows, one horse, one mare, one colt, 30 sheep and a 1.28 hectare plot of land that each year produces potatoes, beans and perennial grasses. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of expanding her farm, Asylkan has turned to microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy cows for cattle breeding. With the income from the loan, Asylkan plans to invest in growing the number of cattle on her farm, and plans to save money for her son's wedding."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":168,"image":{"id":1445270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kayindy village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-06T02:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-05T02:50:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asylkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":8189.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942648,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T20:18:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":613412,"name":"Leonia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonia, 26, is applying for a loan of $1,000 to improve her business.

So, she decided to start her own business with the loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Her credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo - Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of $3000, she will purchase a stock of groceries and will open a grocery store. The Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased.

runs a women\u2019s clothing store that is far from the city center. Although doing this job for six years, she has only made a slight increase in revenue. She says it has been a long time since she was able to buy new clothing.

She was excited by the news that a school will be opening near her shop so she hopes to stock up on clothing that young  people would like. \r\n\r\nSelda and her retired husband do not have any children. Because her  life has been rather difficult, now she hopes that with this loan she will be able to secure a comfortable old age.

He has the support of one worker and he is open every day. This business idea arose from the need for better economic resources to cover his family's basic expenses. Currently, he is asking for a loan as support to buy wholesale merchandise (soft drinks, juices, iced tea), which will allow him to reduce his product costs and thus increase his profit margin on each sale, improving his family's income.

After her husband's death, she alone raised their three children in addition to running her own business.  Astra has a university education and she worked as a merchandise expert for a long time.  She is now retired but runs a business at home.  Her family's main income is Astra's animal husbandry business, which she started 23 years ago with the purchase of 10,000 somi (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today Astra has 2 milking cows, 1 calf, 2 sheep, as well as 1.70 HA of land where every year she grows potatoes.  Her monthly income comes to 15,000 somi (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to developing her business further, Astra applied to microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 somi (KGS) to help her with the harvest.  More precisely, she intends to collect the harvest with hired labor.  She will hire several people who will help her collect the harvest and she wants to pay them for their work.  Astra plans to invest the profits from her loan in further increasing the size of her herd and to save for her daughter's dowry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":143.47,"image":{"id":1445281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for work of potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karakol town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-06T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-05T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3199},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3633},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3739},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3848},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3960},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4076},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4195},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4317},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4443},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4572},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4706},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5312}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.18,"local_amount":3199,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3274.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427102,"comment":null},{"amount":76.29,"local_amount":3633,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3719.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942649,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T21:59:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615926,"name":"Kanikey","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\u0439 60 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 7 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e. \u0423 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\u0439 -

So the loan is very important for Nazik and her whole family, and she hopes for lenders' support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":93.59,"image":{"id":1441187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for a new stock of supplies to sell to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-10-06T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-05T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazik","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":9012.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12430},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12782.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":12504},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":13305.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13639},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13418.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":13623.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13954.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14161.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14261.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14479.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":14606.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15099.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15235.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":15315.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15687.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16034.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":16008.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16476.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16603.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":16832.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":17149.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":17377}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.12,"local_amount":23648.4,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":23994.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308581,"comment":null},{"amount":34.47,"local_amount":13786.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":13988.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845867,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-01T13:20:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":613626,"name":"Rosemary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemary lives on a farm outside of Kakamega town, in Kakamega county.

She is raising three children and also runs her own business after her husband's death. Jamal has secondary education and does animal husbandry as a main source of income for her family which she started 22 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 3,000 som (KGS).

old and not married. She has secondary education. As her main income, Nurzat works with livestock breeding, after having started nine years ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nurzat's persistent work, her farm currently consists of four dairy cows, two horses and 25 sheep.
