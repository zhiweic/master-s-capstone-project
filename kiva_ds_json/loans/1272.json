She started her own business 18 years ago, a small arepas factory in her home, where she works alone Monday through Sunday from 4:00 am to 4:00 pm.  She learned this on her own, out of need for generating an income on her own, since she never got support from her children\u2019s father.  Little by little she perfected her techniques and gained more customers, allowing her to remain active all these years.  Her perseverance, drive, and dedication have allowed her to reach her objectives and her greatest desire is to be able to continue working as long as God and her body will allow it.  It\u2019s for this reason that she is asking for her sixth loan so she can make improvements such as buying heat extractors and renovating her work equipment (mill and pots).

She has a primary level of education and completed up to fifth grade, since she married at a very young age, when she was 16, and later had children. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her husband died five years ago, because he was suffering from an ulcer which could not be controlled. Since then, she has had to take care of the coffee crop and continue struggling to take care of the well-being of her children. \r\n\r\nThe oldest is 31 years old, already married, and has his own crops. He only studied to fifth grade because he was the only man in the family, and when his father developed health problems, it was up to him to take care of the farm, so he neglected his studies.\r\n\r\nThe second is 25 years old and only studied until sixth grade because she didn't like school. Over time, she got married. She lives with her husband in her mother's house, since her husband works outside of the community.\r\n\r\nThe last daughter is 21 years old and is a professional. She graduated as a primary school teacher, and practices her profession in an institution attended by people in poverty. During harvest time, she is involved in cutting the beans.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela's coffee crop is located 200 meters from the home she lives in. The only problem she has is that the broker will not buy the beans at a fair price, since competition is not a problem.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela's goal is to continue growing more coffee plants to earn a better income, and to buy more land to leave to her children as an inheritance so they can get ahead. Her only wish is that her youngest daughter can continue her university studies.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, today she has asked for financing from the COMIXMUL cooperative to buy agricultural inputs to care for her coffee crop and get an excellent crop this season."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1473605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural inputs to care for her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T17:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T17:30:06Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-24T22:19:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636338,"name":"Fatmata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 28-year-old Fatmata from Jui eastern area in Freetown.

Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing.

His wife is a nurse, and they are raising four children.  They have three sons and a daughter, all of whom are in school.  Bahodur is very attentive to his children's upbringing, health, and education.  \r\n\r\nBahodur is a farmer.  For about three years he has been in this type of business.  He got all his know-how and experience working for his father.  Many residents of the Yavan and other regions, towns, and villages work in farming.

The business, the only one that he has ever owned, has slowly grown over the years and now has an inventory that anyone would be proud of.  Ramon wants to grow the business further and broaden the range of products that he sells.  He is applying for a loan that he will use to buy the parts--rims, spokes, tires, etc.--that his customers most want.

Her youngest son is a foreign worker in Russia, and is helping financially. Karamat has a secondary education. \r\n\r\nThe primary source of income for her family is a livestock business, which she started 18 years ago with the purchase of a cow for 5,000 KGS. Through hard work, Karamat's farm now has three milk cows and four sheep. Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS. In order to grow her business, Karamat applied for a 100,000 KGS loan from microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners in order to purchase cows to raise and then resell on the market at a higher price. Karamat plans to invest the income from the loan to increase the number of domestic animals she owns, and hopes to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1474964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows to feed and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bel village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karamat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":922.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1127.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T17:42:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636388,"name":"Salma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Salma.

This is due to the fact that his father died and he was left alone with his mother. To help with the household expenses he had to leave school. He is married, and he and his wife sell fruit drinks and sandwiches.  They have five children, but four of them are already married and have their own families; only one lives with them and is going to school. In the house it is only him, his son, his wife and his mother.  \r\n\r\nSantiago and his wife have been selling fruit drinks and sandwiches for two years. Before selling fruit drinks he worked buying scrap but he earned very little, and later began to sell fruit drinks.  He started with 25 fruit drinks and sandwiches, but increased it little by little each day. Today he has to make 200 fruit drinks and 200 sandwiches, and to transport them to where he sells them he bought an old pickup.\r\n\r\nThen he sells them from house to house on foot. They get up at 5:00 a.m. to begin preparing the chicken for the sandwiches, then at 11:00 a.m. they are brought to where he sells them, and they return at 4:00 p.m. This is how their life is, but he dreams of having a permanent store.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to repair the vehicle he uses for bringing his merchandise to the place where he sells it, and he will invest the remainder in his sandwiches and fruit drinks business. \r\n\r\nHis dream for the future is to buy a piece of land and build his own home, as today the place he lives belongs to his mother. In addition, he dreams of seeing his son graduate from university. From the profits he expects to begin paying off his loan so that he can keep his business going, and in the future have a permanent store and not have to sell door-to-door but be in one place."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1473651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To repair the vehicle he uses to bring the merchandise to the place where he sells it, and the remainder to invest in his fruit drinks and sandwiches business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T20:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T20:50:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":39.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":54.18},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":54.71},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.71},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.27},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.63},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T23:08:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636381,"name":"Biakoye Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The \u2018Biakoye\u2019 group is starting their third loan cycle with ID-Ghana and Kiva.

With this loan she will purchase a new computer and enhance her marketing efforts by creating a catalog that details her complete list of services.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":161.55,"image":{"id":1476370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To purchase a new computer and enhance her marketing efforts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Miami, Florida","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T23:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T23:10:01Z","loan_amount":5350,"lender_count":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dianelys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5344.94,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":5350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":161.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":216.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":218.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":227.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":224.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":229.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":230.35},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":234.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":236.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":239.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":243.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":245.43},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":251.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":254.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":260.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":261.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":265.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":268.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":271.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":275.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":278.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":161.55,"local_amount":161.4,"processed_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T09:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":161.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439625065,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T16:58:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636604,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is a 52-year-old woman from Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental, Mindanao, Philippines.

She and her husband are raising four children.  She is a very calm, honest and goal-oriented woman.  She has a secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business 16 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, she now owns four dairy cows, two horses and 25 sheep.  Her husband and children help her to run the business.  Beside helping his wife, her husband also works as a private building contractor and brings a small income home.

He has a life partner, who takes care of their two children. Juan has a chicken farm. He began farming at age 10 with his father. He also drives tractors and cars, which required learning the trade from a friend. He has been a driver for 10 years and thanks that friend because he supports his family with this work.\r\n\r\nFarming means getting up at 4:30 AM and leaving at 5:00 AM to arrive at his boss's house. He walks for half an hour, works 10 hours on the tractor, and comes home in the afternoon to tend his field. He will use this loan to buy two cows to plow the field, leaving the mulch that he wants to take advantage of.  \r\n\r\nHe dreams of leaving his children a house and seeing them graduate from college, which he was not able to do. He doesn't want that to happen to them, so he is trying to save. The best way to do this is to buy some cows and start earning money from their milk and from his crops.

In spite of her young age, she already has five children and she brings them up happily with her husband.   She has a higher education and works as a chief adviser for her village council.  In addition to her job, she is also involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides an extra income for her family, as it would be difficult to live on her salary alone, especially with five children to support.  Maksatkan's husband works as a private driver, providing transportation services to people, from village to village.\r\n\r\nMaksatkan has been involved in animal husbandry for 15 years.  She started in this business by buying livestock for 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, she now owns four dairy cows and five horses.  She makes a monthly income of 6,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her farming business, Maksatkan has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS). She will use her loan to buy some sheep in order to increase her livestock headcount. She plans to re-invest the profits from this loan back into her business by purchasing additional livestock. She is also planning to save enough money to buy a washing machine, because her children are still young and she needs to wash clothes every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":44.25,"image":{"id":1475072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Boz - Karagan village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T01:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T01:30:11Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maksatkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2124},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2186},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2315},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2383},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2452},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2524},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2597},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2673},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2751},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2831},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2914}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.69},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.25,"local_amount":2124,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2163.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942720,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T16:19:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":634685,"name":"Santiago Noel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santiago Noel es un joven de 32 a\u00f1os originario del municipio de El Sauce, estudi\u00f3 la carrera de Periodismo y hace cinco a\u00f1os inici\u00f3 su propio negocio el cual consiste en brindar servicio de Barber\u00eda a los pobladores en general.

is a student of AUCA and here is her story.\r\n\u201cWhen there is a time to choose a University and faculty there are many questions, but I knew from the very beginning what my goal was and gradually came to it. Starting from my childhood, I watched TV programs and repeated them, even though did not know that it was a profession of journalist. Year after year, I started to explore the world of journalism and I began to like it more and more. It is very difficult to explain what it means to me to be a journalist, but the most important thing is to be informed and share information with people all over the world. Because there are lots of interesting things happening in daily life journalists convey them to the people through TV, internet, radio, newspaper and magazines. Hence, journalists make our life more colorful and more interesting.\r\nAUCA is one of the best universities of Central Asia, not only our country. In addition the teaching methods are very modern and the university atmosphere is very cheerful and friendly, that\u2019s not all at the end of studying at AUCA students will fluently speak not only English, but also several languages which helps AUCA graduates to find best jobs.\r\nMy choice was influenced by New Generation Academy of AUCA. With the help of this program, I changed my views about AUCA. I am very grateful for a chance to become part of NGA, which gradually changed my life. \r\nAUCA gives another opportunity, it gives a loan through KIVA, which is great opportunity for all the students to cover their tuition fees. So, taking an opportunity I am also applying for KIVA loan, which will help me to cover my

These reasons have generated a spiritual or emotional feeling in my self to choose AUCA for future education in order to fulfill my career objectives successfully.  AUCA's acknowledgment and credibility in the education world would provide me a competitive edge over the other students.  This university has tried with so many well-known and emerging organizations and government agencies so it would help me excel in my professional career.\r\n\r\nThe last year at high school I started thinking about my future profession.  Sure enough, it was easy for me to choose my profession.  There are a lot of universities in my country and they are different from each other.  I decided to study at AUCA. Successfully I decided to first start from the New Generation Academy within AUCA, which helped me fill my educational gaps and it greatly prepared me to find myself and my future profession.  I decided to study Journalism in the Mass Communications Department.  Of course it was not easy to find my future profession but now I freely can say that I fell in love with this department.  I have been introduced to lots of students from the JMC Department, they really gave me piece of advice how to study well and how to write clear articles.  When I studied at school I was minister of media, and every day I had to write articles and take photos. \r\n\r\nI am a sociable person.  I have participated in different and useful programs such as \u201cAccess Micro scholarship program\u201d. I am also an alumni of the program, \u201cTechnology age Girls\u201d \u2013 where I am finalist of this project, \u201cNew Generation Academy\u201d.  I am well organized, responsible and patient, with goals to achieve. \r\n\r\nAnother great opportunity that AUCA gives to it's students is that it gives a loan to cover tuition fees.  This loan is given through Kiva and all students entering AUCA are able to apply for it.  I also have financial restrictions in my family and am applying for it.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1476610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He lives with his parents and two siblings.\r\n\r\nElmer learned to repair bicycles and motorcycles because a neighbor and friend is a professional in that field, and every afternoon Elmer went to his place after school.  To learn the job, he practiced everything he learned on his own bicycle.  This was how he set up his own bicycle and motorcycle repair shop about six months ago.  He also is able to work as a day laborer on the sugar plantations near his home.\r\n\r\nElmer's going to use the loan to invest in his shop.  He needs additional stock so he can give more comprehensive and professional service.  He plans to buy tires, rims, single rims, gears, cassettes, patches, and so forth.\r\n\r\nElmer dreams of becoming a professional automobile mechanic, so he wants to work a lot to continue with his studies in college and prepare himself academically to help his parents, improve himself, and have a better quality of life.  He's going to save his profits from his business to use later for his education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":38.58,"image":{"id":1474301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T04:50:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmer Armando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":37.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":38.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":43.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":41.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":43.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":51.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":53.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":59.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":63.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":65.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":67.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":69.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":71.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.58,"local_amount":38.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":38.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716511,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-04T17:34:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":635162,"name":"Magda Arabella","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Magda es una joven de 23 a\u00f1os de edad, emprendedora, luchadora y muy din\u00e1mica, capaz de salir adelante ya que conf\u00eda en Dios y deja todo en sus manos para que sus planes y metas se hagan realidad.

She is entrepreneurial, hard-working, and very dynamic, with the ability to advance, since she trusts in God and leaves everything in his hands so that her plans and goals become reality. She is single and completed secondary school, graduating with a degree in sciences and letters and computer technology, which, because of lack of employment in her community, she has not been able to use. So she decided three years ago to set up and put into practice a business idea, which is renting furniture (chairs, tables, and tablecloths) for special events (weddings, baptisms, graduations, birthdays, wakes, etc.). She lives in the home of her parents, who support her in each one of her decisions, since they trust her and see her ability to achieve. Three siblings also live with her and her parents. Their income and economy depend on this business, which is marketed to their neighbors, friends, and relatives who live in the area and in neighboring areas.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to be able to expand her business and offer another type of service, such as decorating locations for events according to the theme and carrying out all the logistics of the event, since in this way she will be able to offer a service that is distinct from the traditional ones and generate income for the betterment of her family, since she is the sibling who contributes the most to the household.\r\n\r\nFor this reason she has applied for financing to purchase furniture (chairs, tables, tablecloths, and better quality decorations) and be able to increase her equipment, since in this way she will be able to meet the unsatisfied demand for events that customers have asked her to do and that for lack of equipment she has not been able to cover. With the loan, she will prepare herself for the Christmas season and will be able to buy what she needs for cash.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":97.5,"image":{"id":1474273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy furniture (chairs, tables, decorations, tablecloths) to cover festive events.

So, I want to get my bachelor degree at AUCA, in the department of International and Business Law. I worked hard during 11 years of studies at my high school. I was both active in classes and always participated in different activities such as drawing, photography competitions, debates, dance, writing competitions, etc. Also this year I made a project about cleaning oil spills from soil. My project passed to Georgia and the Netherlands. The experiment was really interesting for me. I would also like to mention that I'm a diligent student, not only in studies. My hobby is writing poems of different genres. I chose the American University of Central Asia because is it one of the best universities in Central Asia. Professors at AUCA are from different countries of the world. The life in the university is really interesting. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to all the students; one of which is a Kiva loan. The loan helps students to cover their tuition fees, which is a great help to those students who cannot afford to pay the fees

Jos\u00e9 actualmente trabaja como motorista de camiones y autobuses urbanos; tambi\u00e9n se dedica  a la siembra de ma\u00edz, cultivo que realiza solo para consumo familiar siembra 0.5 ha de ese cultivo y cuidan dos vacas horras. Sus hijos est\u00e1n peque\u00f1os solo el mayor de ellos va a la escuela  y el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o ira el otro a primer grado de b\u00e1sica.\n\nJos\u00e9  entrara a trabajar en la temporada de safra azucarera, como motorista de una rastra o trailer transportando az\u00facar desde la fabrica hasta las bodegas de distribuci\u00f3n del ingenio.

Porque no quiere regresar a trabajar en autobuses ya que resulta muy peligroso ahora, por los niveles de delincuencia que azotan a este rubro y \u00e9l planea entrar a este rubro dice que lo conoce y le parece una buena oportunidad para sacar adelante a su familia. \n    \nLa idea es tener un trabajo seguro, estable y rentable luego de la temporada azucarera; porque mientras se trabaja ah\u00ed, no hay problema se gana bien y se trabaja horas extras y se las pagan al doble y al terminar la safra dedicarse a la compra\/venta de frutas y verduras y as\u00ed mejorar las condiciones de vida de \u00e9l y su familia,  mejorar la casa y que los hijos estudien y vivir de forma mas solvente sin limitaciones.","en":"Jos\u00e9, 34, only has a basic education.  He is married and his wife is a homemaker and cares for the children.  Jos\u00e9 currently works as a truck and urban bus driver.  He also grows corn on a half acre of land for family consumption and takes care of two cows.  His children are small and the eldest is the only one who goes to school.  The second will begin elementary next year.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 will be starting the sugar harvest season and will be driving a trailer taking sugar from the factory to the distribution centers.  He has been involved in this work for 16 consecutive years so he has much experience; but this work only lasts around six months in the summer or until the sugar cane harvest in the eastern part of the country is over.  After that, Jos\u00e9 works as an urban public transportation driver in the city.  He was given the opportunity 20 years ago to learn how to drive buses and trucks so now that is the main source of income for the family.  His workplace is 4 kilometers from home so he must get up very early in the morning to go to work.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy a pick up truck to sell fruits and vegetables after the harvest season.  He prefers not to work with buses now because of the high crime rate in this sector now.  He plans to go into the new business because he is familiar with it and it will be a good way to provide for his family.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a safe, stable, profitable job after the sugar cane season; because as long as he is working on the harvest he earns a good income with no problems.

Her husband works in a school. Ubadat has a secondary education. She is a homemaker. As the main source of income for her family, Ubadat practices livestock breeding. She started this business 20 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ubadat's hard work, she currently has 8 sheep on her farm. Ubadat primarily practices sheep breeding by herself, making hay and putting her sheep out to graze. Her son helps her in this business. Once a year, Ubadat sheers the sheep and takes care of the veterinary work. Three times a day, she feeds the sheep and gives them water. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

Her eldest daughter is married and her sons help with the housework. Her husband works as a weigher at a local utility. Cholponkan has a secondary education, and has been working in a factory as a weigher for 25 years. \n\nFor additional income, Cholponkan and her family are involved in animal husbandry. They started 29 years ago with the purchase of a cow for 3,000 KGS. Through hard work in her business, Cholponkan now has two dairy cows and one horse. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to grow her business, Cholponkan has applied for a 135,000 KGS loan at microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners. She plans to purchase steers and heifers to feed and subsequently resell on the market at a higher price. Cholponkan plans to invest income from the loan to further grow the number of domestic animals she keeps, as well as to save money for her son's

66-year-old widow. After her husband's death, she raised three children by herself.  Her oldest son and daughter-in-law live with their mother and help with the housework, while the rest are married and live separately. \r\n\r\nMairam has a college education, and is a teacher of Kyrgyz language and literature. She worked at the school for 28 years, is now retired. All of the locals relate very warmly to Karamat, as she raised and trained a generation of students. \r\n\r\nIn parallel, Mairam has earned additional income for her family since 1974 through livestock and field crops from cattle purchased for 1,000 KGS.

Nurzada has a secondary specialized education.  As the main source of income for her family, Nurzada practices livestock breeding. She started this business 8 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nurzada's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 14 sheep and 33 goats on her farm. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). Nurzada is in the farming group \"Kyzyl-Kiya.\" There are already two other people in this group, with three members altogether. Nurzada is the group leader. She is respected in her group, punctual, articulate, has a lot of experience in agriculture and knows all the technical aspects of farming.

Her daughters are married and live seperately. Her son is 16 years old, lives with her and helps her with her farming. Marpatkhan has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Marpatkhan practices livestock breeding. She started this business 23 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to the hard work of Marpatkhan and her son, she currently has 6 milk cows and 30 sheep on her farm. Marpatkhan milks the cows and sells the milk, while her son buys the hay and feeds the livestock. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). Marpatkhan is in the farming group \"Kyzyl-Kiya.\" This group already has two members in it; Marpatkhan is the third member.

Of this whole plot, only 3.24 hectares are irrigated, 0.23 hectares are grazing pastures and the remaining parts are under water. Haimurot, along with four other field hands, grow vegetables, cotton and wheat on 3.24 hectares of land. Currently, Haimurot is planning to simultaneously start his own business fattening up and reselling cattle as his communal farm has a big plot for grazing. This means that there will not be a problem with feeding them. He has already been storing up a huge amount of feed for them for winter. Haimurot is requesting a loan to buy cattle. He plans to buy three bulls every month from the Qubadiyon market, fatten them up over the course of 25-30 days, and resell them at a mark-up at the very same market. If he is able to start this business, he will have an additional, stabile income which will allow his family to live better."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1475673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy three bulls in order to start his business of fattening up and reselling cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Qubadiyon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T12:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T12:30:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haimurot","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":148.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":153.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":157.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":161.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":166.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":170.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":175.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":180.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":185.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":190.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":196.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":201.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":207.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":213.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":219.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":231.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":238.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":244.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":251.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":258.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":265.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":273.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":281.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T04:17:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636812,"name":"Dariko","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dariko, age 41, is from the Khelvachauri District.

She has been a widow for twelve years. She has three children: the oldest already graduated from high school and no longer lives with her; the son is nearing his eighteenth birthday, and next year he will begin high school; the girl is fourteen years old and has completed seventh grade. Also living with her is a two year old child who is her nephew. She is raising him as her own son since he was left on her patio. Isabel has to watch over all of the previously mentioned family members as well as cover all of the expenses. \r\n\r\nIsabel has been working in trade since her childhood when she first learned from her mother to work arduously at this activity. She mainly sells clothing for women and men (shirts, blouses, pants, skirts, underwear, and so on). She buys her products by the dozen and sells them as a mobile street vendor throughout the entire community. She has to walk long distances in order to manage to show her products to potential customers. She is a hardworking and very responsible woman. On some occasions, her daughter sells with her, but most of the time she works alone from the first hours of the morning until the evening. She also sells lotions and cosmetics through catalogs.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is to buy merchandise that will increase her sales (clothing and cosmetics) and so as to have a greater income. This will help her to cover home expenses and provide her children with their basic necessities. This loan will also cover the need for working capital since during the summer sales are at their highest and she can have more income. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to become financially stable so that she could have a better quality of life and succeed in seeing her children excel and attend universities so that they could become good citizens."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":23.44,"image":{"id":1474338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy merchandise that will increase her sales (clothing and cosmetics).
