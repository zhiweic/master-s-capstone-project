After she had worked in various workshops in the city she decided she start her own business venture to become totally autonomous. Right now she has her workshop in her house and works with her sister in a line of casual clothing for the whole family. She also has an industrial line because she makes uniforms for businesses and schools. Her goal is to have her workshop totally organized and have her business registry which will allow her to grow her aspirations for new markets. Her biggest challenge is that her working capital isn't enough to make her dream come true. This is the reason she has turned to a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy an industrial overlock sewing machine to do better finishings on the clothing she makes and improve her production time.

He also raises, fattens up and sells small animals such as poultry. He raises these animals in pens outside his house and sells them in the local market or to wholesale animal buyers. It's worth noting that Vicente has 10 years' experience in this activity, which has allowed him to maintain his clientele he has established in this business.\r\n  \r\nRight now, Vicente has decided to increase his inventory for raising and selling animals (cattle and small animals). This is a very profitable activity in the area. This is why he he is asking for a new loan of S\/. 1500 nuevos soles. This will be used to buy cattle o raise, since her has some pasture and improved corrals for his animals. Over time, this will allow him to improve his quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1084233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle to fatten up.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mochum\u00ed -

35, needs 1,200,000 MNT to build a garage on her plot of land. She works as an office assistant and she lives with her husband and her 2 children in their small old house which is in the ger (a Mongolian traditional yurt) district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city. She has been doing her job for the last 7 years and her salary does not usually meet her family's necessities. Her husband works as a plumber and also runs a taxi service with his car. The taxi service is very beneficial to increase the family's income for the necessary expenses, such as the school fees and other expenses of their children. The garage is needed to properly house her husband's car. Before, her husband used to rent space from the rental garage and it had been very expensive. Building a garage will allow the family to use their car for the taxi business and family use in the future.

The quality of life in the community is one of subsistence.

It is also worth mentioning that in this farm area, approximately 120 families live under these conditions.\r\n\r\nMaria works in the commercial activity of raising and vaccinating livestock, selling milk and raising fowl.  These animals are raised outside of her house in external corrals.  Additionally, Maria has 18 years of experience in this line of work, which has allowed her to maintain an established clientele in her business.  She sells her milk at Cayalti market. Her spouse also works his small farm where he has cultivated 1.5 [has] of corn which is phenologically healthy.  Her domestic partner arduously supports her in the activities he does, and there is a good familial relationship between them.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Maria has set the goal of expanding her inventory in the raising [of livestock] and the selling of milk.  The reason for this is that it is a very profitable activity in this area.  Thus, she is asking for a new loan for a total of S\/.3000 nuevos soles, which will be used to invest in the purchase of a motorcycle-taxi to transport products (milk) and to repair the corrals for her animals.

I am from Nairobi, Kenya. I was born second in a family of four siblings including two brothers and two sisters: an elder sister named Berryl; a younger sister called Tinna, currently in her third form in secondary school; and Gabriel, the last born of the family, who is a standard 8 candidate at primary school.\r\n\r\nI chose Strathmore University because I believe that it is the institution that will offer me the best opportunity for quality education. I draw inspiration from my elder sister, who is an alumnus of the University; her colleagues who went to Strathmore with her, and my former classmates who are currently studying at Strathmore. They motivated me to seek admission to Strathmore University, and I am so grateful to God that I was granted entrance and will therefore commence my first year of study on June 25, 2012.\r\n\r\nI am taking out this Kiva loan to fund my degree course through University. This is because my family is currently unable to pool enough resources to see me through my degree. Even though Strathmore University seems an expensive option given my family\u2019s financial status, I do believe that education is a worthy and noble investment in one\u2019s future, and not just an expense as some may perceive. \r\n\r\nMy father, the family\u2019s sole breadwinner, was rendered jobless along with thousands of others when his factory was shut down three years ago and placed under receivership. He now tries his hand at farming. He has established a small tree seedling nursery. He uses the returns to look after the family\u2019s welfare and contribute to my siblings' school fees. My mother, who has been a hairdresser for almost 15 years now, uses her meager earnings to feed the family. My elder sister Berryl, who is currently juggling school and work, is the one who helped my parents put me through secondary school. She is also financing my younger siblings\u2019 education and paying her own fees for a degree course. Her finances are stretched far too thin to pay for my university fees. This has left me with a Kiva loan as my only option of getting a chance to study at university.\r\n\r\nAt Strathmore, I wish to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications, which will enable me to achieve my dream career in the field of Information Technology. This is something that has kept me motivated and inspired me to put in the effort needed to excel in my secondary school education. I want to pursue a leading career in the ICT sector after I graduate from my course, and I hope to make a positive contribution to the development of Kenya. It is through ICT that Kenya can follow the path toward attaining its visions and goals. I also hope that I will be able to further my education and attain a Master's in the same field. I hope to also assist my younger siblings (and anybody else I can) to get the best education so that they may also have a successful and bright future. Furthermore, I am so grateful to the Kiva program as it seeks to help put needy students through school, ultimately leading the way toward raising a nation with fulfilled dreams \u2013 a nation which is successful, grateful, charitable and unified.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":15975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1089696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This area is also known for its food and the warmth of its people. \r\n<p>\r\nIt is in this place that one can meet Sra. Edda.  She is 50 years old, separated from her spouse, and has five children.  Three of them are grown and the other two (ages 16 and 14) are high school students.  Three of her children live with her, as well as two grandchildren (ages 7 and 3) who are in elementary school and under her care.  \r\n<p>\r\nEdda intends to earn a living so that she and her children can get ahead.  She is a merchant who sells all types of clothing.  Edda generates her sales by going door-to-door, but she also sells from her home since that is where she has a few display cases.  Her daughters help with her sales and even deliver merchandise to their school.  They often come home saying that their classmates want to buy some article of clothing.  Edda works every day around the clock.  She extends credit to her customers and collects payment every eight days.  Her merchandise is purchased in Guayaquil as needed.  She has been in this business for three years and has done very well.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more merchandise such as trousers, blouses, T-shirts, and children's clothing.  Edda has been with her Communal Bank for more than 10 years and enjoys being a member because of the help that the loans have given her.  As a result, she has been able to help her children move forward.  Her dream is to see her children finish their studies and become successful professionals.

Her husband is unemployed, but he occasionally earns a small commission on the sale of land in the area through his friends\u2019 contacts. \n\nShe started her business with capital provided by her husband, which she supplemented with credits obtained from the Hekima MFI. Her profits help to boost her savings, and to pay for food and for her children\u2019s tuition. \n\nPast loans have allowed her to acquire various household items for her family (a table, new chairs, pots, etc.). With her business showing growth throughout the last cycle, she has applied for her 4th loan. She will use this new loan to purchase five baskets of fish and more household items. \n\nShe wants to see her children grow up comfortably, and hopes someday to buy a plot of land. She wishes to thank the Hekima MFI and its partners for helping low-income women to become self-sufficient.  \n\nIt should be noted that some of the group members are carrying their babies in this photo, which was taken inside the offices of the central market of Virunga.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":1090615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

He devotes around 12 hours a day to work and may serve up to 30 passengers in a day. He believes business is going well for him because he is very friendly, and above all respectful, to his passengers. \r\n\r\nCarlos is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help they have offered he will be able to make the conversion from a gasoline system to natural gas. This improvement will allow him to use less fuel, which will increase his income, so that he may continue working every day to move forward and achieve his greatest dream: to have a car fleet and have his own taxi company.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1084304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

Rica in the province of Puntarenas, in the region of the Gulf and district of Guaycara, a zone characterized by offering few opportunities for paid employment.  For that reason for these women there are no other options than to find a means of self-employment.  In this case, Mrs. Incris made the decision to begin a small commercial activity offering her clients the possibility of giving them a 60 day credit.  She began four years ago with credit from her providers.  However, from one moment to the next the principal provider closed her credit, and for that reason she is asking for a loan in order to reinforce the capital for her work and to be able to continue with her commercial activity.  Her work has helped with her domestic economic situation, since she still has a young child, which makes it impossible for her to work outside of the home since then she would have to use what she earned to pay for childcare for her three year old.  Among her future plans is the goal of making improvements on her home, since where she lives is a public housing unit, and thus comes only with the basics with the idea that the inhabitants will make improvements to the home.  In this way she hopes to improve the life of her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1084444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

is a motivated and dedicated member of her Detroit community where she has lived her entire life. In 2010, she decided to give back to her community by developing a service center where members of inner city Detroit communities could come to get consultation on document preparation, such as: tax preparation, law representation, resume and cover letter writing, and business plan development. In addition to this, her business is also equipped with notary services. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the business is home-based and employs one other employee in addition to Kandice, however she also relies on her vast network of family and friends to consult with clients that may need help in fields not in Kandice's expertise.

Thirty-five years ago, when she was a little girl, she started learning about farming.  So far, farming has been her main income.  \r\n\r\nTen years ago she noticed the need that people have for wood.  Then she started to sell wood wholesale.  Together she and her husband get the trunks, and they choose to sell them as supports and as firewood.  Her work requires a lot of physical strength in addition to always being ready to buy the wood.  There are a lot of opportunities when there are sales at moderate prices.  \r\n\r\nFlor considers her work to be profitable because she can always sell her products at a good price.  She has plans to expand her sales areas into other cities.  In order to do this, she will put forth great effort to increase her working capital.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the Santo Domino communal bank, and this is her ninth loan with MFP.  She considers her group to be a supportive team that is very united.  She is very happy about that.

Horn has grown rice, plants, and vegetables to feed the family for more than ten years. Her primary obstacle is when there is a disaster and she does not have enough investment in her business. Horn has been with VisionFund since 2011. Her income is used to buy necessary household equipment and food for the family. Now she is requesting for a second loan from VisionFund. She wishes to get money to buy fertilizers and rice seeds and cultivate a rice field. With this loan, she hopes to make more income to better feed her family and expand her business.

Miris\u2019 strength consists in her knowing her business perfectly and that she\u2019s had experience preparing and selling fried products because she used to sell them for four years at stores and at a fixed location before starting this business.\n\nHer business has great growth potential and she\u2019s aware of that because she\u2019s firmly determined to develop it to continue offering her children the opportunity to attain professional, specialized studies.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1084149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","use":"to buy display cases, mobile phones, chargers, room dividers and to sell paper goods an fried snacks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-09T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-08T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64887},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70601},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":72248},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73934},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75659},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77425},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":79231},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":86015}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.85,"local_amount":64887,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":66465.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338748,"comment":null},{"amount":41.18,"local_amount":70601,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":72318.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395307,"comment":null},{"amount":119.23,"local_amount":204401,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":209374.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993951,"comment":null},{"amount":151.74,"local_amount":260111,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":266440.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364528006,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-13T15:39:09Z","paid_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":421034,"name":"Esterlina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esterlina de 29 a\u00f1os de edad vive en el municipio de Malambo, muy cerca a la ciudad de Barranquilla, con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus  4 hijas en las edades de 7,8,9 y 10 a\u00f1os.

She raises these animals in corrals outside her house. However, she mentions that the sale of these animals takes place in a local market and that she has wholesale buyers of the animals. It is worth noting that Margarita has twelve years of experience in this business, which has permitted her to maintain an established clientele. Her husband supports her in the business, and they work well together in this area.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Margarita has proposed to expand her inventory in regard to breeding and selling animals (pigs, goats, and poultry), since it is a very profitable business in the area. It is because of these circumstances that she is requesting a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 2000 PEN which she will use to buy balanced feed and vitamins to fatten the animals and to pay for repairs to their corrals. In time, this will permit her to improve her family's quality of

Her job is very unusual, as she has been a midwife for more than 18 years. She says that she learned on her own and little by little perfected her techniques.

Gilberta says that every year many women come to her for her midwife service and to keep track of their pregnancies. She says that through this work she is proud to bring children into the world. She plans to buy bandages, cotton, gauze, alcohol, pain medicines, surgical soap and other items. She says that this loan will help her out a lot because she will have the necessary materials to provide a good service to her community.

She lives in her own home with her children and husband. It is mentioned that the quality of life in her community is that of subsistence. The majority of the inhabitants are independent workers who make a living in agriculture, livestock and raising small animals, and some also are involved in commerce. Roxana lives in the hamlet of Escute, district of Pacora, department of Lamayeque in a home that only has basic electric and water services. Nearly all of the families in the hamlet live under these conditions. Roxana makes a living raising and selling small animals and also sells beverages (soft drinks, beer and chica de jora, a traditional local drink) out of her home, where she tends to faithful customers. She has two years of experience, which has allowed her to maintain a clientele in both businesses. Her husband is a barber and also arduously supports Roxana in her activities as part of a good relationship between them. Currently, Roxana wants to expand the inventory of her small businesses since they are very lucrative ones for her area. It's for this reason she is requesting a new loan from Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa, which she plans to use to purchase animals (goats and poultry) and to stock her beverage business a little bit more.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Maria Eugenia is requesting the loan to invest in ingredients to increase her sales. She also plans to purchase what she needs to start selling more variety, like tacos and gorditas, and in this way increase her profits.

He says that little by little his activity is prospering because he has purchased much-needed tools for his work, and that will continue when he gets a tool to help him put down flooring or tiles in bathrooms and kitchens. He says that he is going to benefit from this loan because he will purchase the tool he has been lacking to grow his construction business. One of his dreams is to build himself a brick house and to purchase a truck that he could use to more easily commute to Mexico City and not have to pay to freight his tools.

she is in a common law marriage with Carlos. Together they have formed a family with their four children who are in school. Previously, Lourdes was in a large group. This time, she has asked for an individual loan to invest in her business selling chickens. With the loan she will buy more chickens and some candies to sell. She doesn't know how many because she buys little by little.  \r\n\r\nLourdes has had the business for 7 years. She buys the live chickens at a lower price to later sell them at a higher price. She almost always has a lot of orders and sells from her house or in the nearby communities. When we visited her she was very happy since she was able to tell us that thanks to Holy Week she was able to sell a lot. Nonetheless, Lourdes' biggest problem is when there is no event and almost no sales and if worst of all she ordered a lot of chickens, they go unsold. This doesn't discourage her, though, because if she doesn't sell today, tomorrow will be better.   \r\n\r\nOne of Lourdes's goals is to improve her and her family's quality of life. Above all, to improve her children's education. She wants them to finish college so they can have a better life. She is very happy and grateful with the loan since with her earnings she can buy shoes, clothes, and children's clothes. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1084148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy chickens.

The name of their group was chosen after the members had a difficult time deciding whether to name their group after some type of flower or plant.  They ended up choosing the name \"Aroma\" after it was suggested jokingly by a gentleman who is no longer with the group.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Adela is the group representative.  She is 50 years old and a single mother with three dependent children.  Do\u00f1a Adela raises and sells animals such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, pigs, and sheep.  This time she is requesting a loan to buy four pigs and lumber so that she can repair her pig sty that has a roof that leaks when it rains.  She also acquired four heads of sheep and hay for them to feed on, so she will also use her loan to pay for them since they were purchased on credit.  Do\u00f1a Adela is in this business because it is customary for people in her town to raise animals.  This business also gives her a way of helping her children get ahead.  She learned how to take care of animals from her mother.  For Do\u00f1a Adela, the best part is being able to consume the animals she raises because they do not have as much fat as those sold at the markets.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of Do\u00f1a Adela's greatest challenges is dealing with situations when her animals get sick.  If the animals die, she loses revenue and her investment capital.  In addition, the cost of veterinary care and medicines for her animals is very expensive.  One of Do\u00f1a Adela's goals is to see her children finish their education and find a job in their field of study.  She is very pleased because her son, Jos\u00e9 Luis, recently finished his degree in Education.  Do\u00f1a Adela is extremely grateful for this loan because it will allow her to cover the household expenses and pay for her children's education.  Thanks to her previous loans, she was able to open a small stand where she could sell pork rinds and sweets.  The profits were used to pay for the expenses of her youngest son, Mario Alberto, who is studying in the fourth grade.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Adela and the rest of her group are very grateful to FRAC and Kiva for the loan that has been granted.  Each of them will buy animals.  Yolanda, Martha Patricia, Laura, Agripina, and Magdalena will buy chickens.  Mar\u00eda Luisa and Lourdes will buy sheep.

is serving people in their \"barangay\" (neighborhood) through her manicure and pedicure services.  She has been doing this as a source of income for over 11 years. She is very patient and positive in her work. This is for the welfare of her six children; that\u2019s why she patiently does her work.

Braulia is married and has three children. She is originally from this community, where the economic activity is growing poinsettia and making hand-made crafts. She says that there are a lot of handicrafts and souvenirs because the community is very close to a monarch butterfly sanctuary. Braulia is one of the people who year after year oversee the production of poinsettias to adorn house during Christmastime. She is requesting the loan to purchase manure, fertilizers, insecticides and flowerpots since the production begins right now. She has had this business for the past five years and says that she started it to help her husband with household expenses since all their children are in school.

The loan will be used to buy more cosmetic lotions for resale, and will help Annuciate to generate greater profits and pay all the expenses at home. Annuciate hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a big cosmetic shop for both wholesale and retail. \r\n\r\nAnnuciate is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Annuciate who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1089664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more cosmetic lotions for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mubende","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.5 31.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2012-05-10T01:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-09T01:30:13Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annuciate ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":141028},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146122},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":151400},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":156868},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":162534},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":168405},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":174487},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":180790},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":187320},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":194085},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200849}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":423379,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alma is 35 years old and married with four children.

is married with three children between the ages of 7 to 15, and all of them are enrolled in school.  His wife works as a farmer, and he has been a rice farmer for five years.  He would like to get this loan to buy seeds and support labor costs to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Victoria lives in her own house in the village of San Mart\u00edn in the district of Tambogrande in the department of Piura. She has basic electrical service and water is provided by an artesian well. All the families who live in this area also live in these conditions.\r\n\r\nVictoria's work is the business of raising, fattening, and selling small animals such as barnyard fowl and sheep. She raises the animals in pens outside her home. Nevertheless, she sells them in the local market and\/or to wholesale buyers of animals. It should be emphasized that Victoria has 10 years of experience, which has allowed her to maintain her customers since she is already established in this business. In addition, her husband has planted four hectares with mangoes and lemons which he harvests, and he also supports her financially, where they have a good family relationship.\r\n\r\nNow Victoria has proposed increasing her inventory with regard to commercializing, fattening, and selling animals (sheep and barnyard fowl), since this is a very profitable business in this area.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

They live in a community called Cabecera, a very small and tranquil place that gave the group their name. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe, the group's representative, is 43 and married to Raimundo. They've been together for 23 years and have formed a family with three children, two of whom are already in school while the youngest is not. Guadalupe sells down comforters, sheets and curtains. With the loan requested she will buy some of all of those. Lupita, as she's known in her town, has a store in Tula Hidalgo, and has one employee that helps her to tend to the store. She started her business to help her husband with their household expenses. Her biggest challenge is not being able to be there all the time and leaving her family while she works. She also worries when she doesn't make profits because people are looking for better quality and better prices, but she is confident that the loan will help her to stock her store better and increase her earnings. This business has made her a little calmer because she can cover the costs of her home. \r\n\r\nLupita's goal is to make her business bigger, but above all to see all of her children get a degree and succeed professionally. Guadalupe and the other women are very grateful to FRAC and Kiva because now they will be able to buy what they lack in their businesses to increase profits. Angela, Diana, Blanca, Benita and Elizabeth will buy sheep; Victoria will buy clothing for resale; Benita will buy corn to make tortillas; and Julia will start a jewelry business.
