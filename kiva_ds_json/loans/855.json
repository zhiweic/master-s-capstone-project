Here they have a business making sandals, and they also sell their customers merchandise that varies by season. They offer their most faithful customers small-scale financing.  \r\n\r\nInitially, Fulton was an iron monger, a skill he learned from family tradition. But the business began to deteriorate and he had to alter his activity and use this trade only occasionally, when a customer needed iron bars for doors or windows.  Now these bars are more a matter of decoration.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, his wife took a course through the 'National Learning Service' (SENA) and began making womens' sandals. Little by little, she gained a position among her neighbors and relatives to whom she was referred. Since she lacked sufficient working capital to respond to customer demand or to grow the business, she proposed to Fulton that he join her and invest his capital; she saw that this business would be more profitable than iron mongering. They began together the adventure of capturing the small merchant market in the cities of Barranquilla and, also, Cartagena, which today they have done. Things have gone very well and they have added a display location to their business, attended by their eldest son as administrator, while he pursues his professional studies in Business Administration. \r\n\r\nAt present, Fulton is requesting a Kiva loan, his 1st through the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, to purchase, in greater volume, soles, capped heels, leather, and synthetic materials, as well as glue and paint, to give an elegant finish to the new designs they have prepared, especially for the celebration of Mothers Day.

The idea for her business arose when she took a barber course at night at the age of 16 while working days because her teacher hired her when she saw her enthusiasm and ability to apply what she learned.

Her drive to make progress led to her opening an academy and she taught courses becoming well-known later on.  She then got a job that required her to travel frequently so she swapped her business for a good job but five years after that she returned to her original idea of having her own business.  She\u2019s done very well with this one and she also generates income selling merchandise, especially beauty-associated goods.

She will buy the necessary materials and supplies like concrete blocks, cement, sand, lumber, wire, gravel, purlines, metal sheeting, screws and solder, among others thus obtaining the infrastructure to give her family privacy, more comfort and a better standard of living. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1089081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"to add a room to her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2012-05-14T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-13T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.26,"local_amount":1040.98,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286782793,"comment":null},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":1032.06,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1044,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294510166,"comment":null},{"amount":38.38,"local_amount":882.69,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":892.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301834156,"comment":null},{"amount":43.69,"local_amount":1004.83,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308339310,"comment":null},{"amount":33.86,"local_amount":778.73,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":787.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315308193,"comment":null},{"amount":44.02,"local_amount":1012.36,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322916588,"comment":null},{"amount":87.97,"local_amount":2023.32,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339438596,"comment":null},{"amount":82.78,"local_amount":1903.93,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1925.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356436378,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1821.1,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364439158,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-28T11:14:49Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T08:55:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":424665,"name":"Rafis","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Rafisu 28 let, on ne jenat.

Her house is hers and it\u2019s located in the Bellavista settlement in Tarma.\r\n\r\nRaising nine children is no easy task.  Most of them attend higher level schools in the city of Lima so every month she sends a certain amount of money for them.  Thanks to her various activities she\u2019s able to get sufficient capital to also invest in her crops and in her business.\r\n\r\nCarmen has a store selling groceries and basic staple items to local residents.  She also grows potatoes, peas, corn and vegetables on her own land located half an hour from her house.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this activity nearly 20 years and feels that she\u2019s successful selling to wholesale merchants in the market.  She also raises livestock like calves, cows and bulls that she sells to obtain extra money.  She gets the most use from her cattle because she uses them as tools to plow the land.\r\n\r\nHer objectives are centered on her children\u2019s education and she will work hard to continue helping them with whatever she can.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cSe\u00f1or de Muruhuay\u201d communal bank and this would be her loan #7 with MFP.  She\u2019s very grateful for the support provided to date and this is why she commits to be punctual with her installment payments.\r\n\r\nCarmen will use the money she\u2019s requesting to buy three calves whose price varies between 400 and 500 soles that she plans to fatten up for subsequent sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1089137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy three calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-15T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-14T00:00:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1517.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571888,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T03:44:54Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":425851,"name":"Lealoaina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lealoaina is 22 years old and single.

They live in their own house located in the village of Bellavista Huaracayo, Tarma.\r\n\r\nLuzmila\u2019s principal source of income is agriculture. She\u2019s been growing peas, beans, potatoes, maize and vegetables for about ten years. \u201cMy fields are far away; it takes me half an hour to get there,\u201d she says. However, with the determination that characterizes her, Luzmila leaves the house every morning quite contentedly to tend her land. Her husband and some labourers help her at harvest time. When this takes place, she transports the produce to the wholesale market to sell.\r\n\r\nNow she is preparing to sow peas. She is sure that the harvest will be profitable as it is a good time of year to sell the crops to buyers from Lima. \r\n\r\nLuzmila belongs to the Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay Community Bank, and this is her fifth loan with MFP.

He is the owner of a carpentry shop located in the city of Cartagena, where he lives with his wife and seven children who are between the ages of 25 and 51. He began learning his trade when he was 14 years old, from a carpenter who he helped at that time. From there, he took all of his experience, dreamed of having his own workshop, and kept working until he achieved that in 1989. From that moment on he dedicated himself to making and selling furniture. He is simultaneously employed by companies because they know the quality of his work. Cayetano's goal is to expand his carpentry service to include metal working, and to have a larger workshop. He is currently planning on his first \"credikiva,\" which will be the first financing that he has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use it to buy materials and supplies for furniture-making and he will also make some small adjustments to his workspace.

","en":"Alexander, 41 years of age, is a married man with three children between the ages of 8 and 13 years old. He lives in the city of Cartagena de Indias in the sustainable housing project administered by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. There he has made a living manufacturing doors and iron windows and grilles for twenty years. He worked for the Colombian Oil Company (Empresa Colombiana de Petr\u00f3leo) and when he didn't get contracts two years ago he devoted himself to his own business in order to settle his household expenses. With this things have gone well for him. His goal and great challenge is to have a strong business outside of his home as it's not comfortable for the family environment to have his business there.

Turab was unemployed and did not have any educational qualifications. When he got married, he needed a source of income to support his new family and he started his business. \r\n\r\nOver the last two years Turab has gained enough skills and experience  to run the business, thanks to his father`s experience. He chose this crop business because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. \r\n\r\nPeople use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy; many national dishes are made from vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits appear on every family table in Azerbaijan and are also used to make fresh punch. He usually sells his crop in the central bazaar. His monthly income is 60 AZN.\r\n\r\nAs these products are in high demand, Turab wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to meet market demand and to increase his monthly income. \r\n\r\nFor this purpose he has applied for 1000 AZN.

He has a degree in Education but, at 34 years old, he does not work in his profession because his business is more profitable.  He is a cabinet maker who makes living room, dining room and bedroom furniture.  He also raises chickens.  We ask him how come he also raises chickens and he tells us that he has always liked the business but he used to keep his chickens on a plot of land that he owned in Las Garzas (which is near Libertad).  As he didn't have anybody to care for them, he brought them to his house and now it is his wife who spends time caring for them.  In his cabinetry business, he has the help of a nephew.

In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

As for the beef, he buys it from other merchants downtown.  He\u2019s been in business more than 20 years working every day to move his family forward.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy pigs and beef to stock the business.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank since its beginning and she likes it because she\u2019s able to help her husband with something this way.  Her dream is to buy a car because they have to hire transportation to go buy the pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1089307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy pigs and beef.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-05-15T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-14T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariana De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321559,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209157,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335475,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391255,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-16T09:23:22Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":423194,"name":"Lilia Judith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Parque A La Madre se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en el Cant\u00f3n Jipijapa, cant\u00f3n conocido con el nombre de la sultana del caf\u00e9 por los extensos cultivos de caf\u00e9 el cual tiene un sabor incomparable, por su gastronom\u00eda y por la calidez de su gente. \n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la se\u00f1ora Lidia, tiene 62 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen cuatro hijos mayores de edad, uno de ellos aun vive en su casa.

She\u2019s married but has been unable to have children yet.  Her husband works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nShe is a good housewife who in order to help her husband is taking out the loan so that he can use it to cover farming costs.  He has corn, peanut and vegetable crops and our girlfriend tells us that they are now in corn harvest season and money is needed to pay labor costs so that they will be able to harvest the corn in order to store it for certain time until prices improve because if they sell it now they get very little for it from the merchants and they\u2019d lose all their profits from their labor.

She earns money selling clothing from a catalogue, along with Esika products; these include beauty products, cosmetics, perfume, and women\u2019s accessories.  Elena sells her products going door to door and works three days a week, two to three hours per day.  She sells the items on credit and then collects payments every eight days.  She has been involved in this activity for three years and it is going very well.  She says that the perfumes and cosmetics are what sell the most, since they are very good quality.\r\n\r\nElena will use this loan to purchase perfumes, creams, cosmetics, and clothing from catalogues, since she already has orders for those particular products.  She has been a member of her communal bank for 10 years, and likes it because the loans are quickly disbursed and have low interest rates.\r\n\r\nElena\u2019s dream is for her children to finish their studies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1089316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase perfumes, creams, cosmetics, and clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-05-15T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-14T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321562,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209160,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335478,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391258,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-18T09:12:46Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":423453,"name":"Martha T.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha T., aged 42, lives in Buchanan and is married with seven children aged 13 to 25 who live at home.

She sells clothing in the communities in the area where she lives. She is very hardworking and enterprising. \r\n\r\nA few years ago Sandra decided to start a business selling clothing. Some days she also sells meat to her customers. She has lots of self-confidence and is always seeking new opportunities to supplement her husband\u2019s income which isn\u2019t sufficient to cover household costs. So she gets up early every day to do chores, take care of her family, and then begin her job in the communities nearest to where she lives. Many people prefer to shop with her as she is a friendly, responsible woman--but the most important thing is that they always find what they need at good prices.\r\n\r\nSandra\u2019s dream is to increase her inventory so that she is able make more sales and earn more money.

Her business is located near a Colombian professional football stadium, which is the home stadium of Junior, the team of the city of Barranquilla. She sells ordinary meals from 6 am to 3 pm. From Monday to Friday, her customers are mainly people from the neighbourhood, passersby and construction workers, who buy with ready cash or have a tab.

They know her by now and they frequent her establishment more and more. This growing demand in her market is proving to be to much for Denis's resources: she cannot match the needs of her customers and thus asks for a Kiva loan, which is her first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the funds to buy ingredients to prepare food, beverages and fresh drinks in order to be ready for the coming festivities, such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Secretary's Day. With the loan, she will be able to buy more supplies, make larger stocks of the products that are the most in demand, and increase her working capital. This is what Denis needs to slowly see her dream of advancing in life come true, since she owns a house, a car and a small business with which to continue improving her life.

To do so she goes all the way to the city of Lima and at the same time takes merchandise she gets in her own locality there.  One of her goals is to increase corn and pea production and to do so she must invest more capital.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cSe\u00f1or de Muruhuay\u201d communal bank and this is MFP loan #10.  She feels happy to be able to contribute to her group\u2019s growth and she also promises to be punctual with her installment payments.\r\n\r\nJulia will earmark the 1500 soles requested to buy three bags of pea seeds to start this crop\u2019s planting season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1089345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-15T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-14T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1517.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571891,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-30T00:47:01Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":423322,"name":"Rodel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodel is married with a child.

Shirly started by selling perfumes, make-up and accessories from two catalogues, which were the fundation of her business. Gradually, she managed to work with discount sales that she organises every season, for instance this month on the occasion of Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Secretary's Day. Shirly also sells steel jewellery, of which she buys a new stock once a week. Her goal for the future is to buy a house of her own. She and her husband are very determined to attain this goal in order to give their daughters a better quality of life and help them become successful. Shirly is asking for a Kiva loan, which is her first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy discounted merchandise, particularly articles that sell very well this time of year: cosmetics, perfumes, plushies, small appliances, etc. She is confident that this investment will pay off because of her experience, of the orders placed by her customers and of the coming season, which usually sees an increase in her sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1088948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy discounted
