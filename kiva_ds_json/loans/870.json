Thanks to this, her business grew very swiflty, enabling her to gather the necessary capital to open an internet caf\u00e9. She attends customers together with her daughter, who studies computer science. The caf\u00e9 stays open Monday to Sunday, from morning until night, in order to have customers.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,270 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and to pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her bakeshop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngeli hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have her own house and lot.

She has been making a living doing this for four years and thanks to this she has been able to get ahead without having to ask her children nor anyone else for help, she says.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for the purchase of household items like perfume, lotion, and cosmetics, among other things.\r\n\r\nHer dream is a have a large store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1098757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy household items like perfumes, lotions, cosmetics, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Bahia de Caraquez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-06-02T14:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-02T14:00:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209236,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:34:23Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335554,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391333,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150232,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383371,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T12:38:34Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:09:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":427967,"name":"El Mar Y Sol  (Portoviejo) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudadela San Gregorio  de la ciudad de Portoviejo se re\u00fanen  cada quince d\u00edas las 15 socias y los 2 socios del Banco Comunal El Mar y Sol.

She takes individual work orders but makes uniforms for institutions, and neighborhood schools at fixed intervals.

She made the most of every order and sold all of her products.  Now her demand has increased, and she doesn't want to let her customers down or lose the opportunity to do business.  This is why she wants to make a new investment, but she needs the capital.  This is why she is requesting a loan from Integral that will let her buy cosmetics, perfumes, creams, etc.  Celina del Carmen knows that she is very responsible and has very good references.  She is sure that she will make her payments on time.  At the same time, she promises her family a better quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1099609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy cosmetics, perfumes, and creams.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-06-02T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-02T18:40:04Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celina Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":49.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":57.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":61.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":65.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":70.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":71.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":74.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":96.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":428367,"name":"Pedro Eduardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\nPedro Eduardo tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, y habita junto a su familia. \u00c9l se dedica a la agricultura desde hace mucho tiempo.

With the loan that she will receive in her communal bank, she will also help her husband with his business.  He sells all types of clothing.  He sells on credit and collects every 8 years.  In this way, the two of them have managed to get ahead with their family.  She tells us that she has had her eatery for 13 years and it has always done very well; her customers prefer her food because of the special seasonings she puts into her dishes that make them special.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy rice, meat, fish and other groceries to prepare her dishes, and she will also buy clothing for her husband's business.

She opened this business in the center of Playas, because there is a lot more tourist activity in that area.  It's been a year since she opened the business, and it has been gradually growing.  She works alone Tuesdays through Sundays from 8 in the morning until 6pm.  On Mondays, she takes a break from her routine.  Reina tells us that she has not had problems with crime, because the area is tranquil.  She has 3 children who attend public school, and she helps them in her spare time.

She is single, now that she separated from her husband, and her children have reached adulthood and are married.  She really enjoys her work because she feels useful and she doesn\u2019t need her children\u2019s financial help.  She will use the money from this loan to buy flour, salt, notebooks, and clothing for her businesses.  She would like to complete her home so she can expand her

She is a dynamic and hard-working woman who is also very kind and sociable.  She is single and has one son (6-year-old Josmer).  Katherine lives with her parents and brother.  Her business is selling timber from her home.  She buys the timber from a nearby sawmill.  Katherine has the advantage of working as a dispatcher in a sawmill and this is where she learned the business and gains her customers.  She started two years ago, seeing the business opportunity that existed.  She has the support of her parents in looking after the stored timber.\r\n\r\nKatherine believes her business to be profitable.  She has demand and makes good profits.  In addition, she enjoys what she does.  The problem she has is that some customers underestimate her because of her age.  However, she does not become discouraged and she would like to increase her sales volume.\r\n\r\nThis is Katherine's second loan from MFP.  She hopes that she will be able to achieve her goals.  She pledges, once again, to make her repayments on time as she did with her previous loan.  Katherine enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.

She has had the store for 8 years which she opened with her own capital. She tells us that she had the courage to do it because in those days there were not many stores in her neighborhood. Currently she is not the only one and the competition is tough. Clemencia tells us that she works from 7:00AM in the morning until 10:00PM in the evening, and her customers favor her store because she closes so late. We note that at the moment a difficulty for her is transport as the neighborhood where she gets her supplies is far away. Her husband, Luis, is a taxicab driver and industrial mechanic. He has 2 jobs which are going very well. Her 3 children are students and attend the school called Fiscal de Libertad. She will use the loan to buy rice, sugar, and sweets hoping to improve her sales.

Now she grows products only for her own consumption (potatoes, corn, and peas), while her main source of income is producing milk.  She has 4 cows, which are pregnant and about to give birth.  They produce an average of 18 liters of milk a day, which is collected every morning by one of the best milk processors in the country.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Leonidas raises animals like guinea pigs, pigs, and chickens in quantity.  This helps her gain extra income; because she sells to local butchers what she doesn\u2019t eat herself.  Her secret is to plant alfalfa, which serves as the primary feed for her animals.  \r\n\r\nHer wish for the future is to increase the number of livestock she owns to be able to make better profits.

The money is not enough for them to live on. Her mother is a housewife. Despite her young age, Guzal is a very diligent girl, and therefore she tries to develop her business by herself, both to save up for life and to help her parents. \r\n\r\nFor the loan received, Guzal wants to increase the number of livestock, which she can sell for a good price in the future.
