Offering quality dairy products at good prices has allowed Don Francisco to build a strong base of customers who trust him. \r\n\r\nDon Francisco also invests in the care of his herd because his farm depends on the animals. He is therefore applying for a loan to finance the purchase of vitamins for the herd and to pay off the purchase price of a milking cow. Don Francisco expects that these transactions will yield good results and help grow his business. He'll then be able to keep providing his family whatever they need.

As a main source of income for her family, Sharapat is engaged in raising livestock, having started 23 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Sharapat today has on her homestead: four dairy cows and one sheep. Monthly income consists of 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her homestead, Sharapat turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS)

Pardabek is helped in running the business by his wife and eldest son. Currently, he has one steer in his barnyard. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy four heads of steer for increasing the count of salable cattle. For such a business as his, the size of loans is quite small because steer are very expensive. Pardabek loves his work and wants to expand. Raising steers, that is to care for and feed them, is not an easy job, but Pardabek is not afraid of challenges. \r\n\r\nHis work feeds Pardabek, his wife and children.

","en":"Zinat is a young, unmarried woman. She is 30 years old. She lives with her parents in the town of Vahdat. Zinat knows how to sew and cut women's national dresses, as well as to make beautiful embroidery on them. Until now, she has sewed only for herself. Now, Zinat has decided to use her skills and mastery on a professional level. She is going to start sewing and taking orders out of her home. She has already set aside a room for these activities. At her home she has an old sewing machine which is more than 30 years old. This machine is manual and therefore her hands will have to hold on the whole time to twist in order for her to work. \r\n\r\nZinat is requesting a loan for the purchase of a new modern machine, thanks to which she will be able to sew with more speed and quality. With the loan sum, Zinat wants to acquire a computerized sewing machine and fabric for sewing. She plans to sew one ordinary dress every day and one dress with embroidery. At the start of activities, she will be helped by her mother and sister."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":191.35,"image":{"id":1448877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a computerized sewing machine and fabric for opening a sewing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vahdat","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T16:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T16:10:18Z","loan_amount":2950,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zinat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2940,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":94.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":96.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":102.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":109.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":112.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":114.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":119.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":127.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":130.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":133.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":136.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":139.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":142.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":145.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":149},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":152.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":155.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.09},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.72},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":94.89,"local_amount":94.57,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":94.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561552,"comment":null},{"amount":96.46,"local_amount":96.13,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":96.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030454,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-11T23:40:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616028,"name":"Rosalina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalina is 62 years old and married with five grown up children.

Dilorom has a private farm and a few cattle. Her elder son is in the Russian Federation. She learned fattening cattle from an early age, as her parents have been doing this all of her life. For financial reason, Dilorom was not able to get an education, therefore she is involved in agricultural work and raising livestock. At the moment, this is the only income for their family.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, Dilorom drives her cattle to pasture as there are many grasses, and after lunch she is involved in growing crops. Dilorom is a very good and hardworking person. She never sits idle.

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRoribel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRoribel hopes to have a grocery store someday and dreams that her children will have a good future.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":783.33,"image":{"id":1445537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":16666.64,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":16913.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824941,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8456.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478763,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":8333.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8456.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701165,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T15:09:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616030,"name":"Saba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saba is a 35-year-old woman.

For four years Aasba has been running a beauty salon, and she wants to purchase some more cosmetic products and chairs for her beauty salon. For that reason, she has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan. On getting a profit, first of all she will repay the loan amount to Kiva, and then she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is too congested.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nPetra hopes that her business will grow and expand even bigger and dreams of giving her children a good life and education.

He lives in a remote area, where the residents travel to town just twice a year to purchase food products.  In the wintertime, there is no way to access the village. Amon and his fellow villagers mostly grow potatoes. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Amon went to Russia. Amon has suffered many difficulties in life. Since Amon was not educated as a child and has no profession, he also encountered many difficulties in Russia. When he was in Russia, his wife was left with small children and was growing potatoes. Amon has worked hard to educate his son and found a private school for him to attend. His son Shamsullo attended a private school and has received several commendations from the school administration. Hoping to better his son's future, Amon took his son to Russia after he finished high school. Shamsullo enrolled at Krasnoyarsk State Medical University named after Professor Voyno- Yasenetsskogo in the medical faculty. The father is very happy for his son's success and has requested a loan from IMON to cover his son's tuition. He looks forward to your generosity and compassion."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1448986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay for the education of his son ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":157.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":162.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":163.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":162.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":171.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":168.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":174.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":174.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":175.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":179.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":180.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":182.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":185.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":187.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":189.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":191.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":194.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":195.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":136.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619200,"name":"Maria Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera por viudez, vive en el municipio de Villanueva, Cortes junto a sus dos hijos.

is from Yerevan, where he lives with his wife and son. Ararat has been involved in the retail business for many years. His son works at a local copper molybdenum (chemical element) production company and supports the family's living.\r\nBut the main income of the family comes from the retail business in which Ararat has been involved. He purchases scrap metals (particularly copper) and sells it to local companies or factories. Due to his hard work and good communication skills, Ararat has several contracts with companies that are purchasing copper from him. So he purchases copper from individuals and sells it to local companies, thus gathering income from the difference.

He is currently employed in a barbershop, where he has gained a lot of experience, but he wants to have his own business. With the help of a previous loan, David decided to convert a space in his home to start his own barbershop. He says that he already has a lot of customers, and that he has been cutting hair outside of work, both in his customers homes and in the makeshift setup in his house.\r\n\r\nDavid works very hard every day, balancing the hours he is scheduled to work in the barbershop with his independent work. He says that he does this to supplement his income so that he can contribute to his family\u2019s finances. David also helps his younger brother to pay for a training course in barbering, because his brother wants to work with him in the barbershop. \r\n\r\nDavid is requesting his second loan to make improvements to his business. He says that he needs to install a restroom, and that he will use the loan to buy a toilet, sink, urinal, construction materials such as cement and tile, and to pay for labor. David says that the loan will allow him to finish his barbershop, which will let him provide better customer service in a space independent from the family\u2019s living area. With the restroom installed, he will be able to fully work in his business, which he hopes will be very successful. David hopes to increase his income so that he can realize his dream of paying for his university education. He says that he also wants to continue supporting his family so that they can have a better quality of life.

The older children go to school, while the youngest one attends kindergarten under the supervision of her mother, who is a housewife.  Asror is 39 years old.  For the past six years, Asror has been doing his favorite type of work, offering car repair services.  He learned this profession from his father, who has recently passed away.  \r\n\r\nThere are only a few cars in Yavan and therefore, only a few mechanics.

age 61, is from Gango, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental, Mindanao, Philippines. She is married with 5 children. The wages that her husband earns are not adequate to sustain the daily needs of their family. So Emma started a business, a food stall or \"carenderia.\" She has been in this business for 5 years to earn additional income for their family.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Emma applied for membership with PMPC.  Hearing all the benefits, she never hesitated to join. She maintains the status of a member in good standing and repays her obligations in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nEmma is now trying to expand her business and has also decided to venture into a sari-sari (general) store. She wants to gain more profits and to have enough to meet her family's needs, especially those of her children. In order for Emma to realize her dreams, she presented her proposal to Paglaum MPC to finance the project and has applied for a loan of PHP 50,000. She will use the money to expand her business. She intends to buy the raw ingredients needed for her food stand and restock inventories for the sari-sari store. She is thankful to Paglaum MPC for financing her capital needs. In addition, she wants her business to be well-known and to manage the business well for her loyal customers. With her extra income, she wishes to live comfortably with her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":101.83,"image":{"id":1445395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

Hearing all the benefits, she never hesitated to join. She maintains the status of a member in good standing and repays her obligations in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nRecently, Maria Teresita requested financial assistance in the amount of PHP 50,000 to purchase additional stocks for her sari-sari store. As the store is her main source of income, she hopes the loan will help in the expansion of her business and will help her to meet the daily needs of her family. She has found assistance for her financial needs through Paglaum Multi Purpose Cooperative, and she is very thankful with all her heart.

Like the majority of the residents of this region, he has decided to go into the cattle raising business.  He has only one milking cow, which provides the milk for his children.  He wants to buy two cows and start a business in fattening cattle for resale.  Muhiddin will take care of the cattle himself.  He has 1,000 Tajik somoni for his startup capital.  As this is too small an amount to start the business, he applied for a loan for the rest of the money he needs.  \r\n\r\nMuhiddin plans to buy two cows, which he explains will form the basis of his business.

hardworking woman with a positive outlook.  She is married and has four children.  She and her family live in a mountainous area and she has several small houses.  In order to provide their children with all the necessities, she and her husband run their own business.  They are in the cattle business, buying young calves, raising them, and then selling their milk and meat.  Guzal's husband also farms, which brings in a supplemental income for the family.  \r\n\r\nGuzal and her husband work very hard to expand their business and earn a larger income so that they can satisfy their family's needs and requirements in a high quality manner.  Guzal also wants to build a new barn for her cattle, but she doesn't have the financial means to do so.  Guzal wants to buy several more head of cattle in order to expand their cattle business.  And so, Guzal applied to MDO Arvand for a loan with which to buy cattle.  She is hoping for a decision in the affirmative and would like to thank MDO Arvand in advance for its support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guzal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":80.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":86.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":87.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T14:18:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
