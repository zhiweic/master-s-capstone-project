learned of her love for coordinating events years ago, but it wasn\u2019t until her move to San Diego that her passion for event planning and design became a reality. She initially studied design in school, but it took a difficult divorce to finally motivate her to starting her own event and design business. \r\n\r\nDemonstrating the tenacity of a natural entrepreneur, she took what could have been a trying time and turned it into an opportunity to pursue her dreams.\r\n\t\r\nAs a sociable person, Claudia loves meeting new people and finds great joy in interacting with her clients. She began her business by networking with her friends and then expanding throughout the community. One of the most gratifying parts of her job is working with her clients to turn an idea into a reality.\r\n  \r\nWhen Claudia first started her business, she faced challenges with finding capital to expand and purchase necessary equipment. Her $4,000 Kiva loan will enable her to move beyond her current financial restraints and purchase new tables, chairs, and tablecloths, which will diversify the rental inventory she has to offer her clients.\r\n\r\nWith these new purchases, Claudia will be able to expand her business and reach her goal of obtaining her certification as an event planner. It will also help her to establish relationships with local churches that often need to rent tables and

six years of counseling the homeless, Kristi learned that the No. 1 factor leading to homelessness is mental illness. So with her education in psychology, she opened her business to aid them.\r\n\r\nHer practice with the homeless ended in October, 2012, when Kristi decided to work with families who have members with psychotic disorders. She also transitioned to offer a flexible schedule allowing weekend and evening meetings.\r\n\r\nKristi describes her practice as a small one with a handful of clients whom she helps rid themselves from their psychotic symptoms, become more sociable and simply have a regular life.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the Small Business Administration in Shreveport, Kristi applied for a loan with Accion Texas Inc., which she used to furnish her new office. In the past, Kristi worked out of her home, but she says an extra office made it easier to concentrate, since she is no longer distracted by her two children, who are 8 and 2 years of age. She also purchased educational curriculum to study more on psychotic disorders.\r\n\r\nWithout the assistance of an Accion loan, Kristi says she wouldn\u2019t have been able to help as many people as she does now. She used to see four patients but is now able to see 10, more than doubling her services.

family of farmers in the city of Osh. He completed school and became a meteorologist. Isman has six children - three sons and three daughters. Four of his six children are grown and work in various fields, while two of his children are still in school. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, Isman's family decided to start a farm. Thus, they began breeding cattle. Hard work and tireless effort helped Isman develop his business. His 8,000 som monthly profit from the business allowed him to educate his children and pay for his family's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nIsman's youngest children are currently living with him. Together with their mother, his children help him with the farm.

","en":"Esanboi is a 45-year-old married man with four children. He is a very hardworking person and a good family man. \r\n\r\nEsanboi has worked in agricultural production for almost 20 years. He grows turnips and radishes. Additionally, he and his family fatten and sell livestock. Esanboi purchases the livestock at the market, fattens them over time, and then resells them at the same market. His income from livestock fattening is larger than from agricultural production, but he tries to both grow vegetables and fatten livestock because he is in real need of money. \r\n\r\nEsanboi plans to use his loan to purchase both livestock and feed. He would like to increase his overall head of livestock and expand his business. He thanks Kiva for the financial support and understanding.

","en":"Abror is an elderly man of 62. He is married and has four children. Three of his children already have their own families, but he cannot get married because he is short of money. Abror himself is a carpenter, and he also raises cotton and onions. But everything he earns is just enough for him to get by. Despite his age, Abror is a very energetic and industrious man. His son is now grown up and it is time for him to get married. So Abror has turned to Arvand for financial assistance. Abror plans to host his son's event and buy him a wedding dowry. He eagerly looks forward to receiving help and support from Kiva and thanks them in advance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1111.03,"image":{"id":1278226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal

lives in the Malindi area of Coast province, Kenya. He is a married business man. He owns a retail shop, a business which he has been operating for two years. Besides this, he also sells water.\r\n\r\nHe learned about Milango through a friend, and he joined with an aim of accessing credit to improve the business operations.

In general, Russian spare parts are expensive and that's why running an old spare parts sales business is profitable for him. \r\n\r\nThe borrower Bayarsaikhan once received a loan from our organization and paid every installment on the established schedule. This time he is requesting a loan of 1,800,000 MNT to purchase an old russian automobile in order to repair it with his spare parts and later sell it at a higher price.

She previously accessed a 15,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) loan that she used to buy spare parts and accessories and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. Her earnings were a big help in her personal, household and business expenditures. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for a new 20,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of their jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nLucila dreams to have more businesses in the future and hopes to have good health for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Filipino.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

is 44 years old.

Her loan request was rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is Tamar\u2019s salary working as a sales lady at a local grocery store. She only makes 300 Laris per month. It is hardly enough to supply food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nTamar requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With this loan Tamar will purchase clothing for resell. She plans to go to Turkey and buy clothing to resale in her village at a higher price. This will increase the income of her family.

This has been her business for five years, and it is continuously growing.\r\nShe would like to apply for another loan, of 17,000 PHP, to buy more fruits and vegetables needed in her business. The profits from her business will definitely help her to meet her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial growth with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. Bella hopes to expand her business and gain more customers. She dreams of having her own house and having it renovated. She faithfully meets every week with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay back microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1236302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for various fruits and vegetables needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-01-21T09:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-20T09:30:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":2267,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2300.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484693,"comment":null},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":4532.98,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4599.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037202,"comment":null},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":4533.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4599.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781720,"comment":null},{"amount":113.34,"local_amount":4534,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4600.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488612,"comment":null},{"amount":28.33,"local_amount":1133,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1149.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894251,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-21T10:54:51Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":519623,"name":"Davaa-Erdene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Davaa-Erdene, 29 years old, lives with his family in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

He himself provides taxi service to local people, and his main route for taxi service is between the post office and the train station. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some interior repair. Also, he needs an automobile garage. He is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to buy construction materials, such as wood, concrete, gypsum and bricks. At this time, the price of construction materials is at its lowest, and he can save a considerable amount of money. The renovated house can provide a comfortable and warm place for the family, which will burn less coal in winter time. The garage that he will build can shelter his car from external hazards, such as storm, frost and excess heat. A well-protected automobile emits less smoke, due to efficiency in consuming its fuel, and thus contributes greatly to the efforts to limit air pollution."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1342.83,"image":{"id":1280471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education, in their personal, household and business expenditures. Over the years, she was able to add other inventory such as electronic loads, mineral water and processed food.  Her businesses are continuously growing as she and her husband work hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result of a better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAnnalyn hopes that her variety store will become a grocery store. She dreams that her children will finish their studies and will receive more blessings this year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He lives in the small village of Khoni District with his grandmother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Levan requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for his family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow and a calf, whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides this, Levan owns half a hectare of land, where maize is grown. They sell cheese and maize locally at a good price. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLevan requested a loan from Credo for a family business start-up. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

He is a father of four children. Younes works two jobs. For part of the day, he is an employee who earns a low salary. For the rest of the day, he works as a taxi driver. These two incomes help somehow to provide the family with better conditions. The taxi Younes drives needs some maintenance and repairing.\r\n\r\nYounes took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a new engine for the taxi and to make necessary repairs such as installing new wheels. This will increase the taxi's capacity to work extra hours and enable Younes to take additional requests, which will improve the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nYounes appears in the photo beside his taxi. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She lives with Carlos who is a merchant, and from this relationship they have two children; 20-year-old Kelvin and 9-year-old Dumer.  They live comfortably in their own home which they built with much effort. \r\n\r\nThe business that Lilia has is a restaurant where she offers breakfast, cold drinks, and other items.  She takes care of her customers with assorted dishes from the region, like \"juanes\".  For the moment she rents the place where she works by paying an affordable price which allows her to have a higher margin of profit.  She complements her plates with refreshing natural drinks, sodas, and beer.  She has spent more than two years at this location, tending to her customers with the help of her sister.\r\n\r\nShe believes her business is profitable because it has brought her much personal and financial satisfaction.  She remembers that she began her business with the sale of juices, later moving on to the sale of food with a traveling table until she could find the money needed to rent a comfortable place.  Seeing the progress of her business, she has the desire to buy the place that she currently rents because it is in a commercial zone and she hopes to keep growing there.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the MFP institution.  Therefore, she is grateful for the financing and the confidence that they have placed in her by accepting her request so that she can accomplish her goals.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Laila is a 36-year-old, Iraqi woman. She is married and a mother of four children. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Laila is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home. She is using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family. She owns and operates a small, home-based, sewing and tailoring business.\r\n\r\nShe has 15 years' experience working with customers, creating custom-made dresses for women and children, and other small, fabric, household items. To have a better work environment, she would like to renew her work area, which is in great need of painting and renovation. She took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq, to enable her to pay for the work. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor, who are therefore unable to qualify for a loan as an individual.

This group is located in a rural community surrounded by sugarcane fields in the outskirts of San Pedro de Macoris. She makes her home in a simple structure with her long-term partner and three children. For the past six years she has operated a grocery stall where she serves her customers and sells different products. She started her business with her own capital after saving for a while.\r\n\r\nPaulina is excited to be a part of this third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan portions and grown her business.

She will be increasing her inventory and covering orders for the vacation season and the Puntarenas Carnavales, which start in the month of February.  This is a great sales opportunity.  \r\n\r\nThese women also sell food and raffle tickets, which allow them to increase their savings and support their families by covering household costs and their children's education.

She is very happy to know that she has financial support as she feels more secure going ahead in her business, and she promises once more to complete the payments punctually as she does not want to leave a bad impression about herself in front of the members of her group.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 2000 soles, she will buy more fish, because recently she has been having a greater demand and she wants to expand her variety of fish.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1278586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more fish as recently she has been having a greater demand and she wants to buy more variety of fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-21T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-20T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":298.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":317.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":329.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":341.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":347.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":364.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":119.36,"local_amount":298.41,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":304.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122987,"comment":null},{"amount":127.07,"local_amount":317.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":324.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868808,"comment":null},{"amount":131.81,"local_amount":329.52,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":336.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577649,"comment":null},{"amount":136.72,"local_amount":341.81,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":349.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529880,"comment":null},{"amount":139.12,"local_amount":347.78,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":355.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974910,"comment":null},{"amount":145.92,"local_amount":364.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":372.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996171,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-21T23:46:52Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":519953,"name":"Ana Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Empanadas, salchichas, con papas, arepas con huevos, empanadas, picadas y patacones, son los principales productos,  que Ana vende desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, en su peque\u00f1o negocio, ubicado en su domicilio al suroccidente de la ciudad, donde habita con su esposo y tiene 3 hijos adultos.

She was widowed some time ago, but this has not prevented her from continuing to provide her only daughter, Cindy, with everything she needs in life.  They live in their own home, and they also share their days with Cindy's grandmother.  Juliana's mother and daughter have become her main and only motive to give the best of herself in everything she does so that she can get ahead.  Juliana has a business selling fish.\r\n\r\nOver a long period of time, she figured out how to succeed in the competitive business world.  She did a lot of types of work before she came to her current occupation.  She started out with the help of one of her friends, who offered her space in her stall in the main market of the city, and this is where she began her journey.  Now, she has her own stall.  At the beginning, she used to feel that due to her lack of experience, she would not be able to sell what she needed to support herself.  However, time has provided her with enough experience that she now earns substantial profits by the end of each day.  She's been selling for 12 years, and she sells fish of all sizes and prices.  She starts her work at 4 in the morning, and finishes by noon.  She complements this business by working in the afternoons selling soft drinks and ice from her house, and she also occasionally does sewing work, making pants, shirts and blouses.  Her work has allowed her to have time to be with her daughter at the most important moments of her life, and this gives her great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nJuliana has learned a lot from all of her life experiences.  At her work she is very well-liked by her fellow merchants, because she always has a smile on her face and a word of encouragement for her friends.  She feels very happy to be generating her own income.  She has a lot of plans in mind, but at the moment what she wants the most is to keep working.  For the future, she wants to set up a grocery store business in her home.  She wants to achieve this in the near future.  \r\n\r\nThis is Juliana's 8th loan with MFP.

Her profits from the business will definitely help meet her business and family\u2019s daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMarceline hopes that her business will grow even more and prays for good health. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney \u2013 open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1227037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay for spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T03:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T03:40:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marceline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4062.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484704,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8125.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037213,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8125.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781731,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8125.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488623,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2031.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894262,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T04:55:09Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520016,"name":"Anselmo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anselmo is married with three children.

He has been involved in growing vegetables on his land plot for 12 years.  He has several greenhouses, where he grows tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes.  Andrei is very hardworking.  He works on the land and also as a welder in his free time, making greenhouses for other farmers.
