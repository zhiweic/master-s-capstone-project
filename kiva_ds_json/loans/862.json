He is married and has two children, who are all currently in school. For the past 10 years, William has been working hard to manage his welding business, which does widows and doors. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, William has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more machine spare parts to be used in his welding business, help William generate greater profits, and improve his family's standard of living. William hopes that in the future, he will be able to build more rental houses. \r\n\r\nWilliam is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like William, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but they have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1102123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machine

His goal is to help his grandmother acquire these items to improve their wellbeing and to make her efforts in the kitchen much easier. He is also considering his own wellbeing in this situation, since he lives with his grandmother and helps her out around the house as he is able. His work schedule is very demanding, however, leaving him very little time to cook for them and help with household chores. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to pay back the loan very quickly and, with each payment, improve their quality of lie. This is his first loan with FUDECOSUR, and he has not had loans before with state-run banks either. He decided on FUDECOSUR for this loan because of their lower interest rates and better client

Her house is her own, and she lives there with her daughter Farol, age 21, her daughter-in-law and one grandchild.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling food on weekends. She prepares \u201cjuanes\u201d (a regional dish), fried chicken, barbecued meat and other foods. For this purpose, she has a small table installed at the front of her house where she serves her customers in a friendly and cordial manner. She begins her work by getting up very early to buy the ingredients for the day's food preparation. She has more than 15 years with this business, and she has the support of her daughter and her daughter-in-law in serving the customers. She considers her business quite profitable, because she has steady customers and she has been able to win them over with the delicious seasoning of her food. She likes her work, since it has brought her much personal and economic satisfaction, and she has seen it grow little by little. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the MFP institution. She comments that she feels good about her communal bank, since she can count on their ongoing support. \r\n\r\nWith the amount she is requesting, 1500 Peruvian new soles, she will invest in buying groceries and ingredients to prepare a greater variety of her dishes, and she will also buy soft drinks, seeking more convenient prices by purchasing in volume.

Malula\u2019s eldest daughter is a student, and the younger daughter goes to school. Malula is busy with her trade business. She purchases dairy products, haricots, as well as other vegetables from local farmers and sells them in Tbilisi (the capital city of Georgia). She goes to Tbilisi every weekend. The total average monthly income of the family is 600 Laris. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the substantially poor category.\r\n\r\nMalula has requested a credit for starting up a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, because they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d due to their low-income status. With the received credit Malula will start up a dairy farm. She will purchase two cows. The cows will be placed in an old cattle shed located in Malula\u2019s yard. She will produce, on average, 40 kg of cheese each month and sell the produced cheese in Tbilisi together with other products that she sells. The income of the family will increase by 300 - 400 Laris, which will mean a 50% \u2013 60% increase. The living conditions of the family will significantly improve. Malula will be able to finance the education of her younger daughter and provide better care for her little son.

Her partner is Richard and he is the father of their three children: Hill, age 16, Claus, age 15, and Yadira, age 13. Together they live in their own home. \r\n\r\nIsabel works selling clothing and shoes, which she does by making monthly trips to the capital to look for and buy the best styles at the best prices. She started this business more than six years ago, and she considers it worthwhile due to the profit she makes - with which she can pay for household expenses and her daughter's education. This is her way of supporting her partner and getting ahead together as a family. Previously they had financial troubles, and her partner's income wasn't enough to cover all the expenses of groceries, clothing, and others. But since she's begun to work she's been very satisfied with her business. She has plans to grow the business and open a boutique in her home. \r\n\r\nThis is Isabel's third loan with MFP. She says that she's very happy with her community bank, and considers it a united and supportive group. With the requested amount of 1200 PEN, she will purchase more clothing and shoes brought from the capital.

She plans on using the loan to buy another computer and printer for the cafe. Her business strategy is to buy quality and modern computer equipment to attract customers.

He is married and has two children who are adults and live independently.  He is also a grandfather with a 16-year-old granddaughter who lives with him and depends on him and his wife for a good education and upbringing.  He has his own house where he provided all he could to his children and now to his granddaughter.\r\n\r\nHis work consists of transporting cargo and passengers by motorcycle, in and around the city and depending on where his customers need to go.  He has been in business for eight years; and it took much effort to get started, as he was not accustomed to this type of work and had health problems (kidneys).  Over time he figured out how to do his job better and now he is an expert.  What he enjoys about his work is that he can manage his own schedule and take whatever time off he needs.  He also has a means of transport for the family.  He does not feel any pressure carrying out his activity although business is not at its best because demand is down.  But he is thinking about opening a grocery store in his home for extra income.\r\n\r\nThis is his eighth loan through MFP.  He is happy about the financial support and is sure this will help him advance in his work.  Also, he is committed to paying it back on time as with his previous loans.  He likes the communal bank he belongs to because everyone is responsible and supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nHe plans to use the 1,200 PEN to buy spare parts for his vehicle and pay the mechanic for all the repairs.

","en":"Raisa is a farmer from Ukraine.  She started her work as an agronomist at an agricultural collective and is now involved in farming together with her family on privatized land.  She planted areas of cherries and apricots and is also involved in growing grapes and vegetables (tomatoes and cucumbers).  Lately, following her the death of her husband, who was the primary farm-work helper, it became difficult for Raisa to work alone.  Of course, the children help her, but only in their free time.  Her 23 year-old son works as a firefighter after graduating from the Agrotechnological Academy, and the 17 year-old daughter studies to become an artist-decorator in Kulprosvet.  The family of her late husband help Raisa with the business as well.  \r\nIt is difficult for the family to work on ten hectares of land, and this is why it is necessary to hire workers.  Unfortunately, the family does not have such means.  A purchase of farming machinery would significantly speed up the process of preparing the soil for sowing plants and reduce the number of weeds.  Raisa needs help and in the future dreams of building a greenhouse for planting strawberries, buying a sprayer - a very important thing in the farming business.  She wants to help agricultural businesses of Ukraine to grow and flourish by developing her farm!  She needs your help with financing farming machinery."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1095966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCarmen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Carmen earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 380 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCarmen hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

All of her life, she has demonstrated that she is a very determined woman.  As a single mother, she must raise her two children alone.  They are 17 and 12 years of age.  Most of what they achieved to this point is attributed to having a mother who works in order to provide them the best.  \r\n<p>\r\nDeysi raises poultry in a large space in her home that is well-suited.  She raises approximately 100 chickens at a time, starting at the stage when they are newly hatched.  Deysi keeps them for an average of 45 days.  When the chickens are ready to be sold, she takes them to the central market in the city.  Deysi has good customers who are always expected to buy from her since her chickens are good as a result of being raised on a balanced diet.  She has been in this business for six years and enjoys it because it enables her to make use of her time.  At first she had many problems, such as not knowing the complete process for raising chickens or that she had to vaccinate each bird.  Now she is a total expert and is improving her process each day. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 15th loan with MFP and she is pleased to know that she has financial support.  Deysi feels confident that she can advance her business.  Once again, just like her previous loans, she promises to complete her payments.  Deysi also says that she is happy with her group.  She is a long-time member who shows the new members how to work as a team and act in a responsible manner, and everyone does.  The loan amount of 1,000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy baby chicks that she can begin raising.  She will also buy balanced feed, a few vitamins, and necessary vaccines for good development.

is a forty-eight-year-old Romani-man from the Roma ethnic group of Central Albania.  Some fifteen years back, he immigrated to Greece and performed odd jobs there until recently. Now, he is back and wants to stay with the family he missed  so much in going back and forth between the two countries. \r\n\r\nXhevdet\u2019s children are four in total and range from eighteen to eleven years of age. Just like so many other Romanis in the country, being talented at buying and selling used clothes and shoes, housewares, accessories, new fabrics, etc., he wants to do the same thing. The demand for such items is high in his city and it is amazing to see that there is a huge line in the Romani\u2019s market every day. The used clothes are imported by other Romanis from nearby Western European and other neighbor countries. Then they are sold by the kilo to other Romanis who sell them in the city\u2019s market. This type of business is considered to be one which will remain very profitable in the coming years in Albania, since the poverty level remains high.\r\n\r\nXhevdet\u2019s family doesn\u2019t have a house. It was easy to become emotional interviewing this family. All of them live in a shed covered with metal and cardboard that makes it extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. There is no water and no toilet in it, either. During the interview with the father, his eleven-year-old son jumped into the conversation and said, \u201cmaybe someday we will have a house and no cold or hot anymore.\u201d Then, with tears coming down his cheeks, he continued, \u201cmaybe people around the world will feel for and help us.\u201d

Here she sells various goods on a daily basis and also sells items such as clothes, shorts, and cooking utensils to order, taking payment weekly, fortnightly, and monthly. Her clients identify her and recommend her, and so the business has projected increasing sales. Her customers recognize that they can find and buy many of their necessities in her store. But, Gladis has some items that rotate through her store much more quickly than others, and she has a total inventory rotation of 63 days. This is why she came to Kiva to get her first loan through Foundation Maro Santo Domingo with which she will buy women's and children's clothes and small electrical appliances - items that sell quickly and make a good profit.

She is the mother of three children, two of whom are already working, while the third is in high school. By the grace of God, Alma has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of them all the way through college. Most Filipino parents, like Alma, as she herself has been a college undergraduate, believe that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nAlma maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are relying on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She also has a farm. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 20,000-PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAlma dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship co-members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1102794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMa. Gracia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Ma. Gracia earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 830 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n. \r\nMa. Gracia dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1102857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-25T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-24T02:30:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

One is making and selling baby clothing by order. The other is selling infant footwear that she buys in the city or orders from samples from the catalogs and distributes to stores throughout the north coast of the country. Alix has received 4 loans from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation which have helped her to increase her market and her organizational structure. She initially had a very local market and has been able to expand to other regions of the country. Her goal for the future is to have a bar code and sell internationally, initially in neighboring countries until she expands further. Her greatest challenge is competition and the duration of her travels, which allow her to shore up her customer base and increase her sales volume. \r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for her 5th loan which she will use to buy fabric, lace, elastic, infant footwear and general materials. She wants to get them at the special discounts that her suppliers give when she buys in bulk and in cash. This is exactly the reason that her investment will be successful. She will make baby clothing and buy footwear, which she will add value to with her design techniques and finishing touches.

Along with the farm of domestic animals, Bezhan, Mzia and their daughter are busy on family owned 1.3 hectares of land. They grow cabbages, onions, garlic and raspberries. Harvested products are sold in the village as well, to greengrocery produce retailers, who buy fruits and vegetables from local farmers and re-sell them in nearby towns with a price mark-up. The total average monthly income of the family is 700 Laris. \r\n\r\nBezhan requested credit for financing seasonal agricultural work on family-owned land. In particular, he will purchase fertilizers to fertilize the land and chemicals to treat the plants against parasites. All family members will work hard on the plot, especially in spring and summer, to get a high quality harvest. After selling the produce, the family will get more income than last year. That will allow them to improve their living conditions.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1103090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizers and chemicals to treat the plants against parasites","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ruisi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-05-25T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-24T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bezhan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.33,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":201.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209659,"comment":null},{"amount":801.67,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1309.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440427,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-24T12:20:23Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:26:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":430412,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is a 40-year-old farmer from the village of Karaleti, Gori District.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and  as fuel for fires. It can also be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

is 40 years-old. She is married and has two children, age 16 and 9.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000, she established  her cow's-milk-selling business. Working seven days a week and four hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid four loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy a young milk-giving cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Kamala plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for there milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires. It can also be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1101553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a young milk-giving cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-05-25T14:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-24T14:40:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kamala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286992355,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-24T08:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5235.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294646241,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-04T08:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302226916,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-24T10:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315489466,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-27T10:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323094443,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-20T10:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332200679,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340415816,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347170942,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913165,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364624144,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020146,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T16:12:01Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:57:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":430547,"name":"Lucresia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucresia is 63 years old and married.

Manana produces cheese and sells it in the village to local dairy retailers, who buy the products from local farmers and re-sell them in nearby towns for higher prices. \r\n\r\nMalkhaz grows cabbage, green beans and tomatoes on 1.5 hectares of land, which is rented. Also, he has apple and peach gardens on a family-owned, 1-hectare plot of land. \r\n\r\nMalkhaz works hard on the plot. Sometimes, especially in the spring season when there is much work to be done, he hires local agricultural workers for help. Malkhaz sells his harvest to local green-grocery retailers. Also, he has a tractor that is used for agricultural works on his land. He also rents the tractor to neighbor farmers for extra money. The total average monthly income of the family is 1000 GEL. \r\n\r\nMalkhaz has requested credit so he can purchase the land he now rents. As a result, Malkhaz will have fewer expenses because he won\u2019t have to pay the rent. Also, he will use some of the money to finance his seasonal agricultural works. Specifically, he will purchase fertilizers for fertilizing the land and treating the plants against parasites. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Malkhaz plans to save enough money to finance his agricultural works and pay for his family's needs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1103148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase the land he now rents and buy fertilizers.
