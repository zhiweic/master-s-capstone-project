They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married to Jaime, an employee, and she is a mother to their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household, while operating a business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarietta runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out,\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In this case, Marietta is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper, when compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, Marietta's business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in net sales, every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional stock of used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, used bags, and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan back into the business, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nMarietta dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her family is always in good condition. She meets up with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":337.5,"image":{"id":1426987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

after the death of her husband and also running her own business.  Kanymbu has a secondary education. She works at a local school cafeteria.  To provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 24 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 2,000 som (KGS).

He remembers that his father bought him a machete to take him along and teach him how to weed the cornfield; he\u2019d get up at dawn and work all day.  He didn\u2019t get the opportunity to attend school until the age of 14 when he was sent to school.  He learned to read and write and completed first grade.\r\n\r\nLater when he decided to form his own family he\u2019s worked growing basic grains and ten years ago decided to buy a gravid cow to gradually increase the number of animals and he\u2019s managed to develop to subsist and cover other needs.  Today, he\u2019s taught his children to farm so that in future they will be able to develop work skills and develop other skills.\r\n\r\nThe client works raising calves; he buys them small and sells them already pregnant.  He\u2019s been doing this work for about 10 years now.  In addition to this, he works growing corn and sorghum from which he gets crop discards that serve as animal feed during the dry season.  His two children help him with the agricultural chores and to care for the animals.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy calves to raise during the next year; they will be destined to milk production or to sell pregnant and to yield profits to cover some of his family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nIn future, Margarito intends to keep the doors open to another loan once this one is paid off, if necessary.  He also intends to work exclusively raising calves (expand the business) and to let his children carry out the agricultural activities to cover the family\u2019s basic needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1411073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy some calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarito Obdulio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-12T00:39:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605016,"name":"Elfete","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elfete is 52 years old, married, and living in the Ashkali community in the southern part of Kosovo with her daughter and son who are 21 and 25 years old.

Saltanat has a secondary education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 5 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Saltanat's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 bull and 20 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 6,000 som (KGS).

George always has high-quality products, which are sold at a good price at local markets. \r\n\r\nAs the income is only seasonal and not enough for a family of four, George decided to start a business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe start-up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

Blanca sells fish, so she goes out to the local market very early to look for fresh fish, which she takes back to her father-in-law's house. Because the house is in a busy area of town, she sets up the fish in front of the house and waits for customers to come to buy high-quality fresh fish. She has been doing this work for about a year and works on her own since her husband works in another region of Peru and sends money back home to support the household. She likes her work because it gives her time to be at home doing other things. It also offers her a good income, and she hopes to be able to support herself and perhaps in the future set up a grocery store in her house. This is her second loan with Kiva, and she is grateful for the opportunity it provides to increase her working capital and generate higher earnings. She will use the requested loan of 1000 soles to buy fresh fish, as well as some trays and other materials so she can sell more comfortably and not have to use items belonging to her husband's parents."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175.56,"image":{"id":1428078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fish at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T00:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T00:30:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":148.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":160.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":172.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":175.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":184.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":148.05,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":155.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353803,"comment":null},{"amount":60.13,"local_amount":160.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":168.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905562,"comment":null},{"amount":59.91,"local_amount":159.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T10:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":167.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091550,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T18:35:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605030,"name":"Desederia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Desederia is a hard-working entrepreneur who has a restaurant business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 40,000 through NWTF to buy additional ingredients like vegetables, spices, meat, fish, etc., for her restaurant.\r\n\r\nDesederia has been in this business for 28 years.

Jeeps were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and the Jeep was modified into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

They aren't having any difficulties and their flower shops are successful in each of their seasons.

is 41 years old.  She lives with her son in the small village of Marneuli district.  Anna has 2 pigs and a plot of agricultural land, where sunflowers are grown.  She sells the harvested sunflower locally at a good price.  As the income is only seasonal, and not enough to cover everyday costs, Anna decided to get a loan for a business.  But the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  Anna\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements.  \r\n\r\nShe received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

The place where the members live is a large community where they grow corn even though the people of this place are sad because in recent days a frost fell and burnt many crops and they think it will be difficult to recuperate the product, even more so with the lack of rain. Celedonia, who they call Cili, is 48 years old, married to Francisco for 29 years and have a family with six children, of whom only one girl depends on them to attend school. Cili raises and fattens beef cattle, for 25 years, since she was very small. She watched how her mother also raised and fattened animals. when she married she saw the necessities her home needed and decided to help with the expenses. While her husband was working Cili took care of the children and she had a little bit of time left over. Raising beef was her best decision, Cili bought the animals when small and took care of them for a while to sell later. She says it was not difficult to raise them, it requires effort and a lot of work thus her only difficulty is the lack of money to buy them their feed. Also when the animals are sick and lose weight customers don't want to buy them in that condition. \"I continue raising the animals so that when I have an emergency I can sell them, even if they only pay me a little it doesn't matter, I wouldn't like to stop raising my little bulls.\" Cili dreams of continuing to support her husband with the household expenses and with the education of their daughter. \"If she wants to have a professional career, I am going to help her.\" Thus as Cili has grand dreams and great desire to see her daughter succeed, the other members of the group also have goals to accomplish and therefore they are seeking a loan with the institution to invest in their businesses and in this way obtain more income. Concepcion and Marian will invest in their convenience stores.  Maria L. will invest in clothing and Juana will invest in chickens and turkeys. All are very content as they began with a loan and promise the institution and Kiva to remain in good standing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1423972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed for calfs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Valerio San Jose del Rincon.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T03:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T03:10:01Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celedonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8259.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227959,"comment":null},{"amount":946.88,"local_amount":12375,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12389.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991804,"comment":null},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8259.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644452,"comment":null},{"amount":315.62,"local_amount":4125,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4129.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877913,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-14T10:47:29Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605046,"name":"Rukia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukia is a married woman with five children, all of whom attend school.

This is a region that has a cold climate but green meadows and beautiful landscapes due to its geography. Its architecture is a mixture of colonial and modern. The people fiercely guard the culture and traditions that they learned from their parents. The majority work raising livestock and farming. Some go out to the city to perform different jobs, which allows them to improve their economic situation.\r\n\r\nPatricia is one of the women of this group. She is obtaining her second loan in the company of her friends and companions in the Ga\u00f1aloma credit group. She likes this form of loan because they all share a very good friendship and in the meetings they can talk about different subjects that interest them.\r\n\r\nPatricia is 23, married and has 3 children who are 6, 5 and 2 years old. Her oldest two children attend a local school. Her husband works in the construction field as a mason. They live in their own house.\r\n\r\nPatricia spends the majority of her time at home caring for her children, who are still small. But to support her husband with living costs she raises sheep, guinea pigs and pigs and also works in agriculture, selling what she harvests.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to invest the money from her loan in the purchase of fertilizer, seed and feed for her animals. Her dream is to have a business of her own, such as a store.\r\n\r\nThe small photograph is a member who was not able to be present when the group photograph was taken."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750.03,"image":{"id":1428190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer, seeds and animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nab\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valeria Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Byron Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Aida Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ligia Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daisy Corina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2619.79,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":218.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":218.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":437.51,"local_amount":436.64,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":437.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410966217,"comment":null},{"amount":437.51,"local_amount":436.64,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":437.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857954,"comment":null},{"amount":437.51,"local_amount":436.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":437.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506323,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":436.64,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730080,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T08:23:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605060,"name":"Relfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Relfa is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a hardware business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 60,000 through NWTF to purchase additional hardware materials to sell in her hardware business.\r\n\r\nRelfa has been in this business for eight years.

They speak of her as a kind and hardworking woman. As the main source of income for the family, Lira has since 2008 been involved in trade of food products, having started this business with 20,000 som (KGS). She has her own shop where she sells food products. Thanks to her hard work, Lira was able to develop and grow her business. Her activities bring in about 15,000 som KGS per month, which is the basis for food and household expenses. Income from the business allowed Lira to expand her inventory. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her business, Lira turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 83,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of wholesale food products for resale. Income from the loan will help Lira to increase trade in the grocery store, and the resulting profit will help to raise and educate the children in good conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":333.92,"image":{"id":1425182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food products for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ornok village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T14:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T14:30:07Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":83000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4330},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3816},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3912},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4009},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4110},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4212},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4318},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4426},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4536},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4650},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4766},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4885},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5007},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5132},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5261},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5392},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5527},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4711}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.53},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":169.3,"local_amount":8146,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8253.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777207,"comment":null},{"amount":81.3,"local_amount":3912,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3963.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427052,"comment":null},{"amount":83.32,"local_amount":4009,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4062.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942610,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T02:40:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605110,"name":"Rashid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rashid lives in the Kongowea area in Kenya.

He has previously requested loans from local financial institutions several times without any success. Marat\u2019s requests are rejected because his business isn't formally registered. \r\n\r\nMarat is requesting a loan to purchase a car-washing machine to continue his local business. His request has been approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

Aggrey's greatest joy is that his ailing wife will have the convenience of using cleaner, safer fuel and not have to suffer any more from a smoky kitchen.  Aggrey will not also have to buy firewood and LPG gas, and with this money he will be able to repay the loan.\r\n\r\nThe bio-slurry will also save him from buying fertilizer while still improving his crop production, especially fodder, and that will be an added advantage. Well fed livestock will add milk production and increase his income.

She will save a portion of the profits for her children's education, and will reinvest the remainder in her business.."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":59.71,"image":{"id":1425974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a truckload of wood and 50 bags of coal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":13789},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14312},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14835},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15358},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15882},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":16405},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":16928},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17452},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17975},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18498},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19021},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19545}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.3,"local_amount":13788,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":14631.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429407895,"comment":null},{"amount":30.41,"local_amount":14313,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T09:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":15188.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439626022,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-14T16:22:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605151,"name":"Helena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helena is 36 years old and lives in New Kru Town, one of the early communities in Liberia that is well known.

and lives in the countryside, which has good conditions for raising livestock and growing crops. Shuhrat is married and is raising three young children. He is engaged in livestock and crop cultivation, and has sufficient experience in livestock and agriculture. Mainly, he grows wheat, barley, corn, and onions. His wife helps in running the business. Previously, Shuhrat traveled to Russia for work. He remained there for 6-7 months and returned home in the autumn, but due to illness it is already the third year since he stopped going there. \r\n\r\nShuhrat has two hectares of conventionally irrigated land and two hectares of rain-fed land. Due to the remoteness of sources for irrigation water in the summertime, he experiences great difficulties. To reduce the cost of production, Shuhrat does not hire seasonal workers and does all the work by himself with his wife. \r\n\r\nOne of the problems for all the farmers in the region is the remoteness of sources of water for irrigation, which reduces the productivity of land. Shuhrat applied for a loan for drilling a well, which very much eases the problem with irrigation water and thus increases the yield of the land.

She hopes  of having a better future with her family\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1424944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to cover the costs of coconut farm weeding  maintenance and fertilization","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Clarin, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.2055 123.7546","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cabrita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":538.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":538.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2153.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2230.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410099650,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2692.3,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2787.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419865133,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2153.84,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2230.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429513476,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2692.3,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2787.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439737736,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T00:42:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605161,"name":"Taleb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taleb is a 30-year-old single man, responsible for the well-being of three members of his family.

It\u2019s a very small group but they are noted for the unity among them.  They chose the group name precisely because they wanted it to be a united group but also because it\u2019s the name of the community they live in.\r\n\r\nManuela, 69, is a very hardworking woman.  She\u2019s been married to Miguel for many years.  He hasn\u2019t worked for several years and only takes care of the drinking water system now.  They have formed a family of nine children together some of which are attending secondary school.\r\n\r\nManuela works making grilled corn and popcorn to sell outside her house.  She relates that all she has to do is set up a small table and a tarp to start selling the corn.  She only sells weekends on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  She takes advantage of these days because that\u2019s when she sells the most;  she\u2019s been in business six years now.\r\n\r\nManuela says: \u201cPreviously I had no idea how this type of Mexican snack food was made.  The business belonged to my daughter but she had to leave it to go work in Mexico City.  But when I saw the large clientele she had I decided to continue with it myself.\u201d  Manuela is very grateful to Kiva and to VisionFund because when she started selling the corn and popcorn she could only sell 50 because her money didn\u2019t stretch any further than that to buy more.  However, she found out about the loans and that\u2019s how she decided to request one.  Little by little her sales have increased and now she sells 100.  She adds chicken legs to her corn and was able to accomplish this thanks to the support and to her great effort.\r\n\r\nShe comments: \u201cI have no difficulty and am very happy with my business because I don\u2019t have to make much of an effort to carry it out.

Upon graduating, Willian began studying auto repair, specializing in body work and painting. At that time, he also met his future wife, and the mother of their 13-year-old son. The boy is now in the eighth grade at a middle school. Don Willian's wife manages a food stall at the local market, providing income that helps meet the family's expenses. \r\n\r\nDon Willian owns an auto body and paint shop in the city of Sensuntepeque. He began learning auto body repair and painting 25 years ago in the capital, San Salvador, and over the years set himself up in Sensuntepeque, where he and his family now live.   \r\n\r\nDon Willian's son takes an active, daily role in the shop during his free time, generally in the morning before he goes to school in the afternoon. The shop is located four kilometers from the family's home and Don Willian drives his own car to work each morning. His schedule varies with the volume of business, and he sometimes has to work nights, but he is generally at the shop from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. \r\n\r\nDon Willian wlll use the loan funds to build a new workspace at the shop, as the shop isn't big enough to handle all of the work. The lack of space is costing Don Willian customers and money. The new workspace will accommodate 10 cars and allow Don Willian to work comfortably. He'll also be able hire two other employees to meet demand.   \r\n  \r\nDon Willian hopes to open a new shop in another city in the future, so he can serve a larger area and establish a small business. He also hopes his son will be able to study both auto body repair and business so that father and son can offer superior service to their customers.

She has a university education, and most of her family\u2019s income comes from raising livestock and growing crops, having started nearly 15 years ago with 10,000 KGS\u2019 worth of cattle.  Thanks to her determined efforts, her farm now has 5 dairy cows and 5 horses, as well as 2.55 hectares\u2019 worth of land for growing alfalfa and barley each year, and her monthly income has risen to 10,000 KGS.   \r\n\r\nTo develop her farm further, Elmira is requesting a loan of 100,000 KGS from the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners; she hopes to use the money to buy more cows and increase her herds.  She plans on using the additional income that the loan will allow her to continue to buy more cows, as well as to save money for her children\u2019s education. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1425177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kojoyar village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T19:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T19:50:01Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604575,"name":"Azimjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0412 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0418\u0441\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u0412 \u0418\u0441\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0447\u043e\u043d. \u0415\u043c\u0443 34 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u043e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0447\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 -

They live in a community that is very pretty, but that is set back from the main road and can only be reached by several minutes of walking. All of the group's members are enterprising and and they are a new team that is joining up to work with Vision Fund.  They chose their name because their goal is to remain united, especially during hard times.  The group's members are Martha Alicia, Wendy, Abigail, and Briana, and they raise animals such as chickens, turkeys, sheep, and calves.  Teresa will invest her loan in embroidery.  Martha is 52 years old and for 28 years she has been married to Ad\u00e1n, who works in the field for a living.  Together they have a family with three children, one of whom is in school.  Martha has been raising calves for six years.  She learned this business from her husband, as he has always worked in livestock.  She hopes to buy five calves with her loan and she wants to have a successful business, as she does not want to work in Mexico City anymore, which she has been doing to help her husband with the household expenses.  Martha tells us, \"I would like to spend more time with my family, care for my children, and not work so far away anymore.  However, the problem we had was a lack of feed for my calves because it is very expensive to buy them and on top of that I have to buy them food because if I don't, the calves get skinny and I can't get a good price for them.\"  This is why the loan will be a great help; to buy the animals and the food they need to keep them in good shape.

The group is made up of three members who live in a Mazahua community, known for having a very beautiful surrounding of trees.  They meet in a place that can only be reached on foot.  The most celebrated festival is on June 25 where they celebrate Santa Ana.  Gilberto, who represents the group, tells us that his nickname is Beto.  He is 57 years old and was a teacher, but now he is retired and has been married to Aurelia for 33 years.  They formed a family with their children, of whom only one still lives with them.  He is their dependent and attends school.\r\n\r\nBeto is asking for a Kiva loan through Vision Fund in order to buy grocery goods to stock his store.  He says that he started it 15 years ago because there was only one road to get to the other side of town and there were many people on it, so he decided to set up his store.  \u201cI started by setting up a table an some boxes to show my products, however over time I saw a need to buy new shelves and refrigerators to be able to sell cold cuts and also some cold soft drinks.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter some time they closed the road and built a fence, which caused his sales to drop in Beto\u2019s store.  This is when he decided to buy another house in another part of the community, where his store is now located.  Beto\u2019s challenge is the competition, but this situation does not discourage him.  It\u2019s quite the opposite, so he is asking for a loan so he can buy more merchandise.  He feels that if he has a bit of everything in his store, he will attract more customers.  Beto\u2019s dream is to have a well-stocked store.  \u201cI don\u2019t like it when the customers leave with nothing in their hands and then shop at another establishment.\u201d  Aurelia will buy clothing and his daughter will invest in her shoe store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1423904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to stock their businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Ana Nichi, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gilberto","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5763.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6101.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":6392.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6742.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":469.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":492.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":519.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":443.83,"local_amount":5764.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5805.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227962,"comment":null},{"amount":469.87,"local_amount":6102.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991807,"comment":null},{"amount":492.22,"local_amount":6392.46,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6438.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644455,"comment":null},{"amount":519.08,"local_amount":6741.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6789.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877916,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T07:10:43Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606237,"name":"Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandro vive en la hermosa ciudad de Patria junto con su familia, \u00e9l es una persona emprendedora y trabajadora que sale adelante con mucho esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n pues su actividad econ\u00f3mica principal es la agricultura pues cosecha de hoja de coca, \u00e9l pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSe\u00f1or de Huanca de Patria\u201d y esta oportunidad requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar semillas y abono y as\u00ed aumentar su capital de trabajo en este rubro.

She started out sewing around 20 years ago.  She learned the business empirically and little by little she has perfected her knowledge and technique.  She currently works with third parties as she has contracts with some neighbors in the area.  She works Monday through Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. or according to the amount of work she has.  This is how she has been able to generate the income to provide the daily necessities to her household and to provide her children with an education.  She is an enterprising, active woman who is dedicated to her family and her work, which motivated her to ask for a loan to buy an overlock sewing machine.  It will increase her current capacity, facilitate her work, and improve her production time in filling orders with the best quality finished garments.  This will be reflected in an increase in contracts and an accompanying increase in income that will allow her to keep ensuring her family's wellbeing.  In this way, Marta wants to keep moving forward to achieve her dream of strengthening her business and making it more profitable so she can offer her children, and especially her older daughter, a better quality of life and a better education.

Asya has a specialist high school education and raises animals and crops as her family's primary source of income, a business she began 14 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 15,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Asya's farm now contains two milking cows, two calves and five sheep, with monthly income at 10,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her farm, Asya has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase steers for fattening and then reselling at the market for a higher price. Asya plans to use income from the loan for further augmentation of the size of her herd.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":622.5,"image":{"id":1425216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase steers for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ananievo village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T21:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T21:30:08Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":830}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":622.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":30348.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942612,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-12T16:36:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605214,"name":"Cynthia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cynthia, 30 years old, lives in New Kru town which is one of the oldest communities in Liberia.

lives in New Kru Town which is one of the oldest communities in Liberia. Living conditions there are bit difficult due to the high rate of criminal activity, few bathrooms, filthy conditions, overpopulation; but the interesting part is that rooms are bit cheaper, there is an option of traveling, it contains one of the biggest markets in Liberia, and cheaper rates for food. Martina is 42 years old, married with five children ages between 2 and 15. All her children are in school and live at home. For the past five years she has been operating a small shop where she sells items like candy, biscuits, and peanuts. She started this business by selling around in the communities for her mother, and learned this way of selling from her friends. She says sometimes sales are slow. She is requesting a loan to purchase more items like candy, biscuits, and peanuts for her business. She hopes to build a house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":67.09,"image":{"id":1427281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
