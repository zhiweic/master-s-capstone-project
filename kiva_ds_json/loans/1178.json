She's married and has two children with whom she lives in an adobe house. Virginia owns a grocery store which she set up on the ground floor of her house. She set it up four years ago with the goal of helping her husband support their family's finances. At first she bought very little merchandise to give it a try, and soon she saw the good results she was getting and bought much more products. She reports that the products that are in highest demand are rice, sugar, milk, oats and other cereals. She also sells cell phone recharges as well as fruits from that area in order to obtain additional profits. She feels very comfortable with her work because it also helped her to become a very well-known neighbor and make several friends. However, occasionaly there are customers who ask for merchandise on credit and take too long to pay her, resulting in some losses for her. In time she wishes to improve her business even more and eventually become a wholesale seller, so that she can improve her profits and also her finances. This is her third Kiva loan and she feels grateful for the financial support she's receiving so she can get ahead. In addition, she pledges to make her repayments in a timely fashion. On this occasion she wishes to get 3,000 nuevos soles in order to stock her business with products such as eggs, sacks of rice, sacks of sugar and vegetables."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":902.46,"image":{"id":1399749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase foodstuffs such as eggs, rice, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-07-30T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-29T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":464.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":479.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":478.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":511.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":527.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":538.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":346.13,"local_amount":943.98,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":965.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865064,"comment":null},{"amount":175.32,"local_amount":478.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":488.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353430,"comment":null},{"amount":187.42,"local_amount":511.15,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":522.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905194,"comment":null},{"amount":193.59,"local_amount":527.97,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":539.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091189,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T14:00:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588043,"name":"Maricel Gay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maricel Gay is a 26-year-old entrepreneur who is single and lives in Pagadian City.

She is single, and her 2-year-old son is the motivation to make an effort every day for a better lifestyle, since she dreams of being able to have her own house and live comfortably there with her little one. Sandra has received the help of her son's grandparents and lives with them and her son in Quito, the capital city of the Republic of Ecuador, specifically in the southern sector of the city where business is very active.\r\n\r\nSandra, with her mother as her guide, learned the art of cooking from the time she was very young. She makes some delicious typical dishes and, of course, dishes a la carte. Two years ago, with the birth of her son, she saw the need to take advantage of this skill in the kitchen, and she started a restaurant in a small building. She offers breakfast, lunch, and dishes a la carte as well as special dishes such as \"pinchos\" (kebabs), \"tripos asadas\" (grilled tripe), and \"encebollados de pescado\" (a soup made with onion and tuna). Sandra decided to start this business when, after looking for a long time for work that would sustain her and her son, she found all the doors closed, since she only studied through primary school and that was not sufficient anywhere.\r\n\r\nNow Sandra takes advantage of the knowledge acquired from her mother and at school to manage her restaurant, where she personally takes charge of the food preparation and the customer service. She invests at least 6 hours every day from Tuesday through Sunday. She shares her free time with her son and also looks to amuse herself by doing some sewing work.\r\n\r\nSandra is asking for the loan in order to be able to make repairs to the restaurant's infrastructure, since it needs some decorations and implements that would give the place an ambience in which her customers could feel comfortable and that would also draw attention when people pass by. She is sure that with this loan her customers will increase and therefore her profits will be greater, which will help her to cover the household expenses and also to give her son a quality lifestyle."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":431.67,"image":{"id":1399589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to make repairs to her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-30T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-29T01:50:08Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":76.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":87.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":90.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":92.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":94.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":97.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":102.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.29,"local_amount":76.68,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":77.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814481,"comment":null},{"amount":85.19,"local_amount":84.53,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":85.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320652,"comment":null},{"amount":89.46,"local_amount":88.76,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":89.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856340,"comment":null},{"amount":87.16,"local_amount":86.47,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":87.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059918,"comment":null},{"amount":92.57,"local_amount":91.84,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":92.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995251,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T15:39:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":589574,"name":"Maria Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera, tiene cuatro hijos y vive en el municipio de San Francisco, Atl\u00e1ntida.

The condition of her house is not good, and the living standard of her family is miserable.\r\n\r\nSaima requested a loan of 35,000 Pakistani rupees for her husband. Her husband owns a spare parts shop in which he sells motorbike spare parts such as silencers, fuel tanks, foot rests, wheels, tires, tubes, etc. Her husband also supplies spare parts to other shopkeepers with his rickshaw. Nowadays, his auto rickshaw is out of order due to overloading. Its engine needs some maintenance. Through this loan, her husband can easily fix the problem with his auto rickshaw. Saima hopes that one day the miserable condition of her family will change.\r\n\r\nSaima is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC

Jos\u00e9,  es un agricultor con mucha experiencia, trabajador y sobre todo una persona honesta y con deseos de superaci\u00f3n.\n\n Vive aproximadamente a cuatro km de distancia de la carretera litoral.

He has been farming since he was 10 years old, as his parents didn't have the necessary resources to provide him an education, he had to learn how to work. He remembers, when his father who was a farmer all his life, would take him to the field where he was planting so that Jos\u00e9 could help him work, and in this way he learned which where his chores and tasks to do to grow the corn. Jos\u00e9 is a very experienced, hard-working, and above all honest person with desires to succeed.\r\n\r\nHe lives approximately 4 km from the coastal highway. So it takes a great effort when he has to go buy the items he needs to farm, as he has to walk this distance as there isn't regular transportation in the community where he lives. From there, he travels by bus to the city to buy everything he needs to plant. He has to do this same trip back to his home, but this time he has to pay for a car to take him as he couldn't otherwise return with all the supplies.\r\n\r\nThe loan he seeks from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy seeds, fertilizers, herbicides to control weeds and insecticides to prevent infestations and plant 14,000 square meters of corn.\r\n\r\nThe investment will greatly help him, as he will plant and will have personal food for his family and with the rest he hopes to have income from the sale of the corn and in this way pay the loan and at the same time continue to have an open door for future loans with the foundation.\r\n\r\nHe believes that if God gives him life, he will continue growing corn. But he would like to plant greater quantities of land, and in the future he hopes to be able to opt for new loans in order to buy 7,000 square meters of land.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1399797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds, fertilizers, herbicides to control weeds and insecticides to prevent infestations and plant 14,000 square meters of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-30T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-29T02:30:06Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Avilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T23:53:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":589596,"name":"Rosa Vilma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa de 48 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposo y sus dos hijos desde hace varios a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta y elaboraci\u00f3n de hamacas vende de forma ambulante por las diferentes colonias que est\u00e1n cerca de su lugar de residencia, tiene mucha clientela por la buena calidad de sus productos, Rosa esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de  tela, hilos de polipropileno, algod\u00f3n, nylon, etc. para seguir elaborando sus hamacas ya que esa es su \u00fanica fuente de trabajo y as\u00ed obtener mejores ganancias para darle a su familia lo que necesita sin limitaci\u00f3n alguna.","en":"Rosa is 48 years old and lives in her own house with her husband and their two children.

Her husband drives an auto rickshaw, but his earnings were so poor, so she started tailoring in her home. She has been doing this for the past five years. She knows the techniques of stitching very well. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns enough to lead a decent life. She also deals in the business of clothing sales to generate an extra amount of income. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she has requested a loan to buy a new sewing machine as well as some packs of zippers and buttons to meet the increasing demand. In addition to repaying the loan, she will use part of the revenues to pay for personal expenses.

He works 12 hours and returns home at 6:00 p.m.  Although he is a little tired he does not want his family to go without anything.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting through Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 500 bricks, 200 lbs. of iron and 20 bags of cement to build a room.  He lives with his father in the same house and would like to have more privacy.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have his own business, build a bigger house and see his son graduate from the university so he can earn a better living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":271.39,"image":{"id":1399856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy 500 bricks, 200 lbs of iron and 20 bags of cement to build a room.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-30T07:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-29T07:30:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William Abelardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":475,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":37.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.52},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.31,"local_amount":33.31,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":33.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815009,"comment":null},{"amount":34.86,"local_amount":34.86,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:22:08Z","rounded_local_amount":34.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090959,"comment":null},{"amount":35.05,"local_amount":35.05,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":35.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856838,"comment":null},{"amount":168.17,"local_amount":168.17,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":168.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716620,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-27T05:06:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588109,"name":"Fiapaipai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fiapaipai is a 22 year old single woman.

lucha por sus 3 hijas de 29, 27 y 17 a\u00f1os, a quienes ha sostenido con la ayuda de sus padres. Mar\u00eda es una mujer de campo, desde peque\u00f1a aprendi\u00f3 las labores de agricultura y ganader\u00eda  junto a sus padres, en sus tiempos libres ella disfruta mucho sembrar hortalizas, tejer y caminar por la finca.

She could only attend primary school, which has become an obstacle for her to find better job opportunities. However, she fights for her three daughters, who are 29, 27 and 17 years old. She has provided for them with the help of her parents.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a countrywoman. She learned to work in agriculture and cattle raising when she was a small girl, together with her parents. During her free time, she enjoys growing vegetables, weaving and walking around her farm. She lives together with her daughters and her parents Crist\u00f3bal, 78, and Josefina, 79, in Los Bancos, a canton located in the province of Pichincha, one of the largest provinces of the Republic of Ecuador. This canton is located close to Quito and has many forests. Its neighborhoods are inhabited by kind people with their original traditions. Mar\u00eda and her family live far from the town, in a farm that is also their workplace.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda started a livestock business right when her first daughter was born, i.e. 29 years ago. She works at least 12 hours every day cleaning, feeding and milking her cows. She also purifies the milk and makes products such as homemade yogurt, cottage cheese and sweets. She enjoys working with these activities, even if the weather is not pleasant during the winter time, especially in the early morning when she starts working.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is requesting a loan to buy compost, fertilizers and seeds to improve the pastures, since they were ruined during the winter season and she needs to feed her cows in order to produce good-quality milk and to keep them healthy. This loan will help Mar\u00eda and her family to have a stable economy and work in order to cover their basic needs. Mar\u00eda is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the support and advice they have given her and for letting people from all over the world be part of her progress through Kiva.

He is single and has 2 children. He grew up in the country and after finishing primary school started working with his parents on the land, learning about all types of crops.\r\n \r\nThe young entrepreneur lives in Santo Domingo, an important port of commerce in Ecuador. It is the place where the Coast and Sierra regions meet. That is why it is there that products are traded to go to different cities. Wilmer is proud of being a native of this city. The tropical humid climate favors agriculture and its land grows the most delicious products, demanded around the world. \r\n\r\nAlways working on big farms, Wilmer acquired enough experience to be an expert on trees and soil. So 6 years ago, he went off on his own and began managing his parents' land. He invests most of the hours of his day on the work that each crop needs. He grows passion fruit, plantains, cacao, and other staple products. Nonetheless, Wilmer needs to fertilize the land to be able to plant new products and increase the yield and quality of the existing crops.   To do that, Wilmer is asking for a loan that he will invest totally in buying the fertilizer. \r\n\r\nWilmer is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the trust they have put in them to grow in his work as well as for believing in him and his future projects.  The fact that they are helping him with the loan motivates him to work harder to obtain better results. \r\n\r\nWilmer affirms that the lack of capital has always been a problem and getting financing hasn't always been easy. Nonetheless, now the support for micro-businesspeople has grown and it is thanks to projects like Kiva that involve many people from around the world cooperating with each of them.

She has had work experience as a salesperson in various grocery stores in the municipality she lives in, which allowed her to generate income to support her household for several years.  She is an enterprising, hardworking, and very active woman, but a lack of job opportunities made it impossible for her to find employment.  For this reason, she decided to go out on her own and start her own business.  To achieve this, she is asking for this loan to outfit a space in her home to start her own beauty salon and she needs to buy fixed assets (styling chairs, mirrors, a station, a dryer, a straightening iron) and bulk supplies (shampoo, conditioner, hair treatments) so she can offer her clients good service and take advantage of the experience she has acquired carrying out this service at home. This will give her the financial stability she needs to get her son ahead and to provide the resources to support her household.

She has a higher education.  She had worked in Russia as a nurse for a long time.  She returned to Kyrgyzstan and is currently looking to be hired as a nurse at a local hospital.  She has been involved in animal husbandry for over 13 years, having started this business with 5,000 som (KGS).  Today her business contains two bulls.

","en":"Shahnoza is a young, married 29 year-old woman.  She lives with her family in the city of Dushanbe.  Shahnoza has a higher education in economics, but has not worked in her profession since getting married.  Now Shahnoza decided to work and be an independent woman.  Shahnoza's mother has a successful retail business.  She sells fabrics and materials.  Shahnoza has intentions to also start her own retail business.  She already leased a retail outlet at the central market of the city.  Shahnoza's starting capital amounts to 1000 US dollars.  However, this amount is not enough to purchase merchandise.  This is why Shahnoza requested a loan.  Shahnoza wants to use the loan and her savings to purchase fabrics and materials and start her sales.  According to Shahnoza's words, her mother, who brings merchandise from Turkey, will be the supplier of merchandise.  Shahnoza believes that her business will also be successful because her mother will be helping her.  Thanks to the loan, Shahnoza will have her own business, which will yield her a good income.

He lives with his daughter and his common-law wife.\r\n\r\nHis parents taught him the businesses of farming, bricklaying and crafts (hammocks made of natural or artificial silk.)  His father taught him to make hammocks from the age of ten, and now he is very skilled.  All of his brothers also do this type of work.\r\n\r\nHe went to school in his village and obtained a basic education.  He currently provides a living for his own family.  His hammock business is profitable.  He sells his goods in his local community and in two other cities on Saturdays and Sundays, and also makes them at the request of customers.  He makes 12-14 hammocks each month.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he also works with his father growing corn.  They are raising 7,000 square meters of this crop in their area.\r\n\r\nJavier buys his materials (thread, tubing, thimbles and caps) in the closest city.  He has to travel by bus for one hour to get there.  He goes every eight days, and on other occasions, depending on what orders he has to fill.\r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to purchase three boxes of silk thread, 40 pairs of thimbles, three dozen caps and plastic tubing for making hammocks.  He will invest the remainder in agriculture, since he also works alongside his father growing crops.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds, he will obtain the supplies he needs so he can continue making hammocks and increase his production.  He has orders and at times needs to fill them on a deadline.  This will also allow him to offer more products to his customers.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he will be able to improve his quality of life.  His corn crops will ensure that he can feed his family.  At the same time he will make more income from the sale of his hammocks, which will enable him to provide sustenance to his wife and daughter.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to grow his sales little by little.  He also wants to create a permanent location for his business where his customers can come to shop.  In addition, he plans to build a house for his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":230.09,"image":{"id":1399934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase three boxes of silk thread, 40 pairs of thimbles, three dozen caps and plastic tubing for making hammocks.

She has a great deal of experience in agriculture, especially in planting plants; she worked at a plant nursery for six years. She later decided to become independent and open her own business. She started planting in the open, but the sun and water exposure damaged her crops. Because of this, she built a greenhouse, which she has to this day. She sells garden plants, both indoor and outdoor, as well as clay pots and baskets. Through this business she has been able to generate the necessary income to support her family over the past eleven years. \r\nGilma is a very active woman who is dedicated to her family and to her work.

He was born and raised in the country, where his father taught him to work in agriculture. Generations of his family have made their living this way; it is a family tradition. For fifteen years he has been a dairy farmer. He has several heads of milk-producing cattle, and he sells milk to the largest dairy companies on the national level. This is how he makes an income to support his household and to care for his animals.\r\nHe is a hard-working man who has overcome his obstacles through hard work and dedication, despite the low sales price for milk.

Con esto podr\u00e1 adquirir recursos adicionales para el sostenimiento de la carga econ\u00f3mica de su hogar, brindarle una mejor educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos y darles la oportunidad de tener un futuro pr\u00f3spero y exitoso, que permita mejorar la calidad de vida a mediano plazo.","en":"Kelly, age 27, is separated. She is a mother and the head of her family; she lives with her two children, ages 7 and 10. She started selling merchandise and products from a catalogue six years ago, and did this for three years. She learned the business from an aunt who did the same work. This is how she made an income to support her family. However, because of a job opportunity with a company, she had to close her business. Today, Kelly wants to complement her work at the company with an additional income for her family. She has decided to take her business back up. She will sell merchandise and Amway products, so she is requesting a loan to invest in the purchase of stock (body lotion, household products, and toiletries). Her goal is to have a good stock available to offer her clients, who will be her family members, friends, co-workers and neighbours. This will allow her to make an additional income to sustain her household and provide her children with a better education. This will give them an opportunity to have a prosperous and successful future, and improve their quality of life in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":155.06,"image":{"id":1400498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock (body lotion, household products, and toiletries).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"La Ceja","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelly Juliett ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57227},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58791},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60399},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62050},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63747},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65489},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67280},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69119},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71009},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72950},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74945},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76994}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.1,"local_amount":56665,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T09:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":56720.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822320,"comment":null},{"amount":61.84,"local_amount":116413,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":116527.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095399,"comment":null},{"amount":0.59,"local_amount":1113,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1114.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074463,"comment":null},{"amount":62.53,"local_amount":117710,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":117825.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T14:46:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588284,"name":"Gidda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gidda is married with two children, both of whom go to school.

35-year-old Christian from Torkpoi town Bo in Sierra Leone.

She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation.\r\n\r\nChristian requires a loan in order to purchase palm oil, garri, and general stock.

He was born and raised in the countryside, where he learned to work in agriculture from his father. Today, and thanks to this, he owns sugar cane plantations and sells the harvest. This way he makes enough to bring food to his family\u2019s table.\r\n\r\nElkin is a persistent and hardworking man who is devoted to his family and his job. This motivates him to work long shifts and to struggle to get ahead. He fights every day to overcome the obstacles. He has gone through difficult times due to the low prices of the panela [unrefined whole cane sugar] in the market, which in turn affects the price of the sugar cane.\r\n\r\nThis is Elkin\u2019s first cycle.

For twenty years now, Veronica has been supporting her family in coordination with her husband by running a 'genge' (small shop) selling fruits and vegetables. She works from 7 am to 4 pm daily and is able to make a good profit per month. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 17th loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania, She used the previous loans to buy more 'genge' items like tomatoes, sacks of onions, coconuts, and more vegetables with high demand. She bought two fridges to put in her new retail shop she opened. With the profit from the business, Veronica paid school fees for her children and also home expenses. She will use this loan to buy the missing 'genge' items. She dreams that one day she will be able to own a wholesale business.\r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group \"Makuti A\" which totals 11 members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

She is doing fine with her business. She works from 6 am to 5 pm daily, and is able to make a good profit in a month. \r\n\r\nThis will be her ninth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans to restock more food items along with soft drinks, and has paid back all her loans successfully. With the profit received, she covered school fees and reinvested in the business. She will use this loan to buy a refrigerator for her business.  \r\n\r\nAneth dreams that one day,  she will be able to offer more food services to her food enterprise. \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group,\" UNITY\", which consists of 13 members.
