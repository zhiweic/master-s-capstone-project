He lives with his wife and son in the small village of Tskaltubo district. His wife is a housekeeper. The family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows and produce dairy products for selling. Besides this, they have a small plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of fruits and vegetables are grown. In the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living. So, he decided to start his own business with the loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. His credit requests were rejected several times, as he was unable to satisfy their requirements.

She lives with her three children, the eldest works as a day worker and bricklayer's assistant and the others go to the local school and support her financially. She only reached the fourth grade at school as she had to work from a young age.\r\n\r\nShe makes tortillas for a neighbour every day from 7am until 2pm and at the weekends she sells things at home with her daughter. They sell drinks and snacks to people who pass buy and players from a local football court. She has a lot of experience in commerce, having worked her whole life since she was a young girl and since getting married she has enjoyed working in this industry. Previously, she had a school cafe and a tortilla business in the city when she was with her husband. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting, is to start a business buying and selling clothes for all ages and making pupusas at weekends, this will let her have a better income as she works hard and struggles to survive with her children. If the business is her own she will earn more as at the moment she works without seeing the results.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the loan is to have the necessary income for financial stability in the business as this year her daughter will graduate with a basic level of education, next year she will start at secondary school and will need money for the journey and food. She also hopes that her younger son will continue studying and prepare academically so he will have better opportunities in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":486.33,"image":{"id":1426236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to start a business buying and selling clothes for all ages and to make pupusas at the weekend.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-09T18:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-09T18:50:15Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":34.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.15,"local_amount":27.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":27.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090971,"comment":null},{"amount":28.8,"local_amount":28.8,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":28.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856923,"comment":null},{"amount":430.38,"local_amount":430.38,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":430.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505186,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T17:15:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603865,"name":"Mahlia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Mahlia group consists of three women and one man.

She makes traditional skirts, which are part of her community's culture, and she sells detergent. \r\n\r\nAltagracia travels to the city to buy merchandise to sell in her town, but she prepares the detergent herself with the chlorine she buys. She has applied for a loan to buy chlorine, which she will use to make detergent. Neighbors come to Altagracia's house to buy both chlorine and detergent. She says she used to sell linens in other towns, but, at her age, it's hard to travel. She says she doesn't face any particular problems in her businesses. She does her work enthusiastically to keep her long-time customers and to have some income to pay her household expenses. She lives alone.\r\n\r\nAltagracia's single dream is to keep working and keep the businesses she enjoys going. She is very grateful to Kiva and Vision Fund for the funding that has helped the members, Eulalia, Blanca Estela, Mar\u00eda Severiana, Isidro, and Yolanda, grow their businesses.

He lives in the small village of Vani district with his wife, two children, and mother. His mother is provided with a retirement pension. His wife works as a saleswoman locally and gets a small monthly income. Zaza is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has two milking cows and two calves. His mother milks the cows every day and produces dairy products for selling. Besides this, they have a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown. Zaza sells the harvested products at local markets at a good price. As the income is only seasonal, he decided to get a loan and start his own business and seek for credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or restarting businesses.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for every item in the store.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells shoes and belts for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nBreezy dreams of having another business and hopes to have good health.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their lives and business every week.  There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet every week.

Miller makes his living planting cacao, yucca and other products on his small farm.  For a long time, Miller suffered setbacks in his life as he did not have his own income to support his household.  And so, ten years ago he decided to start a new project with the goal of making a name for himself.  He thought that his fiends, neighbors and family would want to purchase products from his land, in accordance with the season.  He started his business and it is now doing very well.  Miller likes what he does, as it allows him to have time to take care of his animals and his household.  In addition, since he started his business, his finances are doing very well.  He now has money for his household, and he hopes to continue growing, which is why he is thinking of expanding his sales.  This is his first loan with Kiva.  He hopes to collaborate with Kiva to be able to continue with his objectives.  At the same time, he promises to punctually repay his loan.

Gulgaky has a secondary education.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 14 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulgaky's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow, one heifer and one calf.  She also works on 0.60 hectares of land, where she annually plants clover.  The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Gulgaky requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows in order to increase livestock headcount.  Gulgaky plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and plans to save money for her children's continued education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1423610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows in order to increase livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Pokrovka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-09T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-09T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulgaky","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-09T20:02:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603930,"name":"Sinat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sinat, 38, is married and lives with her family in a village of the Tbaung Khmum district.

Her previous loan was a big help to her business. She was able to buy the needed spare parts and accessories for her tricycles. Her income from her business helped in her family's everyday expenses. She now has two tricycle units. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 19,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her tricycle unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nBenilda dreams to have another tricycle unit and hopes to become rich.

The energetic lady standing on the extreme right with raised hand in the photograph is Farzana. She resides with her husband and one son of three years old. To increase the income of her family, in the year 2013, Farzana, along with  four other older women clients of Mahashakti Foundation formed a group named Samaleswari to access loans from Mahashakti Foundation. This is the first loan for her and fourth loan for the other members.\r\n\r\nFarzana herself has been running a fancy store in the daily market of Khariar town for last fifteen years with the help of her husband. She basically sells ladies' items like bangles, talc, combs, oil; face cream, plastic items, cosmetics, ornaments, etc. Farzana brings the stock for her fancy store from the wholesale market 200 kms away, that is from Raipur. Presently she is selling fancy items amounting to 1500 INR to 2000 INR per day from which she gets 15 to 20 %. profit. From this small income she is hardly able to cover her family expenses.

Thanks to Dinara's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow, two bulls, one calf and six sheep.  The monthly income amounts to 17,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Dinara requested a loan in the amount of 45,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount.

Her husband does not work, as he is retired.\r\n\r\nAntonio learned fabric-cutting and dressmaking from a very young age. Several years ago, with the aim of earning her own income and making use of her knowledge, she set up a small dressmaking workshop in her home. There she creates all kinds of clothing, although what she most enjoys making is children's clothes. She works to fulfil orders from individual customers, and in the current season she also makes uniforms for the local primary and secondary schools. When she has a lot of orders to deliver, she works every day.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking another loan because the previous one went very well; she made a lot of school uniforms, and so had a very good income. She has not been short of work, and uses her earnings to buy food and other household items, since her husband no longer works and they have many expenses. She will use this new loan to buy fabric, thread, zippers and other supplies to make her garments.

She is the mother of four children and still lives with her \u200b\u200bhusband in Mandela. She has been in the business of buying and selling grain for more than 7 years. Her experience in this trade has earned her a good reputation, and she receives orders from a variety of clients. \r\n\r\nIn order to have the resources necessary to meet her clients' needs, Sitan partnered with Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. Her previous loans have been repaid. This new loan will allow Sitan to purchase fifteen 50-kilogram bags of fonio (an important species of millet that was among the first grains to be cultivated in West Africa) and five bags of maize. She buys her stock in the surrounding villages of Mandela and usually sells to men and women locally and in Sikasso. With this loan, she hopes to make an average monthly profit of 32,000 CFA francs per month. These profits will be used to pay the interest on her loan, and the rest will be reinvested in her business. She is counting on becoming a well-reputed wholesaler in order to satisfy her growing customer base.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":212.5,"image":{"id":1264716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase grains.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mandela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-10T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-10T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207721,"comment":null},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972412,"comment":null},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624963,"comment":null},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850970,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T15:44:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604800,"name":"Carmen Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carmen, es una persona de hogar, vive con su esposo y sus dos hijos.

Fue sus esposo quien le ense\u00f1ara a trabajar y a desarrollar las diferentes actividades que se realizan en el campo como corte, aplicaci\u00f3n de abono, fungicidas, herbicidas, limpieza, etc. La tierra que ellos trabajan en familia la han adquirido con gran esfuerzo y trabajo encontrando desaf\u00edos como la baja de precios y las fuertes lluvias (factor clima) ya que en este rubro la competencia no es factor problema.

She is grateful to her parents for the support and efforts they made that made it possible for her to get a basic education. Together with her husband, she works in agriculture, growing coffee. They have a very large family, with 7 children. However, only two live with them in the family home, along with one grandchild. They are the only members of the family who work in the fields. Her husband taught her how to do this work and how to carry out the different activities required, such as harvesting, spreading manure, applying fungicides and herbicides, and weeding, etc. They went to great lengths and worked hard to acquire the land that they work as a family. There have been challenges along the way, such as low prices and heavy rains (climate conditions). Competition is not a difficulty in this sector. Their land is 50 metres from the family home. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's plans and dreams are to ensure that the technical assistance needed to make her crops more productive is carried out, so as to maintain an income for her family. Her dream as a mother is to provide a better quality of life for her two children and grandchild. She also hopes to reinvest the her earnings in order to increase the size of the land she farms. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion she has requested finance from the cooperative COMIXMUL to buy agricultural supplies, such as manure, coffee fertiliser and fungicides etc., which will help make her dreams and plans a reality.

She is the mother of two children aged 17 and 4 years old. The oldest has graduated from high school but can't enter university for financial reasons. So he's at home right now. The youngest is in kindergarten. Diana is responsible economically for both of them and works in family's homes or takes care of seniors. But her employment is sporadic. They live in a rented apartment without much luxury. Diana's income barely covers the household expenses so they must limit themselves in many aspects and go without in others. At this time her best prospect to get ahead and offer her family a better quality of life is through the education of both herself and her children. \r\n\r\nBesides her children Diana must also help her mother who is 56 years old. She is also a nursing aide but because of her age, social prejudices and the requirements of some institutions, she has not found any work. Fortunately she takes care of the two children while Diana is working or studying. \r\n\r\nDiana is an example of getting ahead and effort. She has carried on alone in the face of great adversity. Three years ago she separated from her husband for motive of mistreatment. She has not been in communication with the father of her children, not even to claim the economic recompense due to her by law. He does not work and she doesn't want to put her family through this type of experience. So she decided to continue alone. \r\n\r\nGiven this whole situation she considers the help offered her for her program at Campoalto, a respite from a difficult economic situation. She can help her son with his expenses at University which begins in June. Campoalto has given her the opportunity to study and at this time her marks are outstanding. She hopes to continue like this during her whole course and graduate with honors."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1329139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to continue with her second semester of nursing at Campoalto.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-09-10T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-10T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.36,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":156653.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539995,"comment":null},{"amount":142.5,"local_amount":266000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-15T11:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":277798.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752515,"comment":null},{"amount":152.14,"local_amount":284000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":296597.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845826,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T16:12:01Z","paid_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604064,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a 53-year-old woman.

lives in Meghri, Syuniq Region, with her husband and daughter. She is a very hard-working woman and is currently self-employed, taking care of her family by cattle breeding and gardening. She owns a plot of land and cultivates apricots, peaches, cherries, figs and blood oranges. \r\n\r\nTo meet her family's basic needs Angela now wants to expand her livestock of cows. For this reason she asks for the lenders support in collecting a loan of USD 3,000 to buy three more cows. As this is Angela's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF.

So, Tamara has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

She expects to use her loan to purchase different types of vegetables for making sauces (peppers, tomatoes, onions, cabbage and Maggi bouillon cubes). She stocks up in Bamako from the wholesalers and resells in Tiele, at retail, for cash and for credit to a clientele made up of men and women. She hopes for a monthly profit of 20,000 f CFA, a sum which will allow her to repay the loan and reinvest in her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":816.67,"image":{"id":1424424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase vegetables for making sauces.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"TIELE","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-10T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-10T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kossira  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nakeni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207727,"comment":null},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972419,"comment":null},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624969,"comment":null},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850977,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-11T00:42:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604327,"name":"Rosalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a widowed parent of five children, Rosalia works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a buy-and-sell rice business in the Philippines and also earns additional income from a general store.
