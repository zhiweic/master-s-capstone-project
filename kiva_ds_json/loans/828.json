According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nGiga requested credit for purchasing an accordion. Giga\u2019s loan was analyzed in the terms of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program will provide business start-up credits with soft conditions to the rural poor. These borrowers do not have access to standard credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With his own accordion Giga will be able to play at parties, as well as other cultural events held in the district, and earn additional income. The new source of income will allow Giga to improve his living conditions.

Not too long ago, she closed the shop where she offered phone calling services, due to a lack of working capital.  Over time she was able to save considerable money thanks to her husband, who works as a mechanic at an automobile company.  She used it to buy two vehicles which she rents for public transportation, receiving 30 PEN a day for the service.  The business has helped her greatly with household expenses, especially since  it does not require a lot of maintenance as her husband keeps the vehicles in perfect condition, changing the oil and giving them constant check-ups.  \r\n\r\nNow she wants to save enough money to open her shop again, which she knows will be successful.  She belongs to the communal bank \"IDME\" and this is her 25th loan through MFP, where she is counting on you support to continue toward her goals.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time.  She likes her communal bank as all the members are responsible and caring.  Margarita plans to use the loan to buy eight new tires for her two vehicles, four per vehicle, at cost of 250 PEN each.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1053286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy eight tires for her vehicles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-09T11:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-09T11:00:10Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":468},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":492.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":509.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":530.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175.5,"local_amount":468,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":468.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714170,"comment":null},{"amount":184.56,"local_amount":492.15,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":492.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203070,"comment":null},{"amount":190.88,"local_amount":509.01,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":509.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098743,"comment":null},{"amount":199.06,"local_amount":530.84,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":531.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401593,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T03:51:05Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":412554,"name":"Marezbon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0431\u043e\u043d \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043e\u043c. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0431\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435- \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435. \u0412 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d. \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0431\u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b. \u0421 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 $3000 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044e. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443.","en":"Marezbon is a kind and industrious person.

When her husband passed away, she started working twice as hard and helped her children stand on their own feet.  She is very well known and respected in her village.

Six years ago, when he returned from Costa Rica, he started his farm using his savings to buy 1.73 acres of land. This was when he started to cultivate coffee. Coffee farming is an expensive venture, but coffee-especially the organic coffee sown in the northern part of the country- is in high demand. In the north, the majority of the population, as well as all of the tourists, are always in search of a good cup of organic coffee whose texture, flavour and aroma is intoxicating. Jaime works with his wife in the fields. He is requesting a loan for the  purchase of supplies for sowing, and to pay labourers to sow 2.5 acres of organic coffee.\r\nJaime wants to have a high-yielding harvest that is, above all, high quality.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Lorena is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLorena hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In addition, Bertha dreams with her family having economic stability and a much better quality of life than they currently do.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1058292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy basic staple items to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-04-09T19:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-09T19:00:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35621},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":36620},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37648},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":38705},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":39791},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40907},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":42055},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":43235},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44448},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":45696},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":46978},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48296}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.42,"local_amount":35699,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":37676.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902603,"comment":null},{"amount":21.84,"local_amount":36395,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":38411.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326958,"comment":null},{"amount":22.3,"local_amount":37159,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":39217.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432348,"comment":null},{"amount":23.32,"local_amount":38860,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":41012.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378380,"comment":null},{"amount":24.15,"local_amount":40272,"processed_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":42503.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433012,"comment":null},{"amount":186.97,"local_amount":311615,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":328878.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617473,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T14:37:04Z","paid_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410601,"name":"Philip","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philip plans to venture into another business of building rental houses alongside his transportation business.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMilona maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer\u2019s order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 21,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMilona dreams of expanding her business and helping her children finish their studies through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1060168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for merchandise items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-09T19:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-09T19:30:11Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7171.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606743,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4482.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095599,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3585.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359209,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3585.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303030,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2625,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2689.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355795,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T05:58:16Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410627,"name":"Jawad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is from Iraq.

This time she plans to use her part of the loan to buy four televisions that were ordered by her customers. She likes to run this business because she can still have more time at home to take care of her children who are still in school. With her income, she can help her husband, who works as a driver in the port, to have extra income to pay their children's school fees.

In order to increase their commercial activity, the group have become members of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are asking for their second loan. Mrs. Maimouna (seen in the photo as woman sitting down all the way to the left) has a strong reputation for selling food pastas in the village and surrounding areas. She plans to use the loan to purchase 10 bags of spaghetti from a bulk market in S\u00e9gou. She re-sells the products both through credit and cash from home to home, at the local markets in her village and the surrounding villages to a customer base mostly comprised of women. She hopes to have a monthly profit of 45,000 FCFA [approximately 80 USD] which she will reinvest in her business and take care of the needs of her children.
