They live together comfortably in a home of their own, which they bought after much effort and hard work.  Doris sells carbonated soft drinks of many brands.  Her products are delivered to her weekly from the distributor and she sells them out of her home.   She has a cooler that she bought with her own income and she sells different flavored drinks.  She also has a part time job in the mornings, when she works cleaning for one of the towns in the district.  She started her own business with her own capital, more than eight years ago, while occasionally receiving help from her partner.  She considers her business to be profitable because it provides her with a good extra income for the household expenses.\r\n\r\n \r\nBefore starting her business, she had some financial difficulties, since the price of food constantly rises and she didn\u2019t have enough income.  She decided to generate an additional income to help with her expenses.  Having resolved those problems and seeing the success that her business has had, she would like to continue it.  She also wants to restart her prepared food business.  This will be her fifth loan through MFP.  She is requesting a small loan so that she can meet her objective.  She also says that feels comfortable with her communal bank, because of the help they give people with a desire to get ahead.  She will invest the 1,500 PEN she is requesting in ingredients, such as rice, sugar, noodles, and other things for her food business.

He is married to Miluska, who is a merchant and the mother of their four children. Together they live comfortably settled in their own home in the company of two of their children, Denis and Sarai, who are 19 and 9 years old, respectively. Javier's work is selling fresh fish, which he buys in the mornings at the local fishing port and sells as a street vendor, using a tricycle set up with a speaker to offer his products. He also has a motorcycle taxi which he rents to a driver, obtaining an average of 25 PEN daily, thus generating an additional income.\r\n\r\nHe began this business more than six years ago, using some of his own capital, and then he augmented it with loans, with his wife helping him with the sales. He feels that his business is reasonably profitable because of the earnings that it gives him, since he generally sells everything that he has to offer. He comments that he decided to begin his business out of the need to have a job, since he does not have a profession, and thus to have the necessary income to pay for his children's schooling, since managing to educate them is the best inheritance that he can leave them. In addition, seeing his daily earnings, he considers it more profitable than his last job as a mason.\r\n\r\nTherefore, seeing his good results, he wants to continue with his business to keep it going. This will be his third loan with MFP, so he hopes for your help to continue with his goals. In addition, he feels comfortable in his communal bank because he considers it a united and community-minded group.

de 55 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer buena y amable, adem\u00e1s de ser trabajadora y emprendedora con muchas ganas de progresar. Est\u00e1 separada del padre de sus hijos pero le pasa una pensi\u00f3n para su alimentaci\u00f3n. Vive en su propia casa en compa\u00f1\u00eda de \u00faltimo hijo de 29 a\u00f1os y sus 02 nietos y sus hijos mayores ya son independientes. La actividad que realiza Juana es la venta de comidas como juanes, tamales, caldos de gallina y otros. Todos estos platos los prepara en su casa para luego venderlos de forma ambulatoria caminando por las calles de su vecindario. Se inicio con un capital de 10 nuevos soles vendiendo motes sancochados  que los ofrec\u00eda  de casa en casa, fue ahorrando sus ganancias y lo invirti\u00f3 en la preparaci\u00f3n de juanes , logrando la preferencia de sus clientes que la esperan a diario por la buena atenci\u00f3n que les brinda y hasta el momento lo realiza sola. Considera a su negocio rentable por las ganancias que le deja y la regular clientela que ha sabido ganarse con el pasar del tiempo.\nAntes de empezar su negocio, ten\u00eda problemas econ\u00f3micos, ya que se hab\u00eda separado del padre de sus hijos, y necesita un ingreso econ\u00f3mico para poder alimentarlos ya que con la pensi\u00f3n que les daba no les alcanzaba, tambi\u00e9n para tender un oficio y darles una mejor calidad de vida. Viendo los buenos resultados, tiene planes de continuaren su negocio, y con las ganancias comprar un unidad de transporte para alquilar y generarse m\u00e1s ingresos econ\u00f3micos. Este ser\u00e1 el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 03 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Se siente contenta de saber que contar\u00e1 con una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito para avanzar con su negocio. Por eso manifiesta ser\u00e1 responsable con el pago de las cuotas como en cr\u00e9ditos anteriores. Adem\u00e1s comenta le gusta el trabajo de su banco comunal por la ayuda que brindan a las personas con el acceso a una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito. Con el monto solicitado de 1500 nuevos soles, los juntar\u00e1 a un capital propio y los invertir\u00e1 en la compra un mototaxi de segundo uso valorizado en 2000 nuevos soles, para alquilarlo y  as\u00ed generarse m\u00e1s ingresos, como tambi\u00e9n ahorrarse gastos de transporte.\n\n","en":"Juana is 55, and is a friendly, good woman, besides being hard-working and enterprising, with a great desire to get ahead in life. She is separated from the father of her children, but he gives her alimony. She lives in her own home with her youngest son, 29, and her two grandchildren. Her adult sons are already independent.\r\n\r\nJuana sells meals such as juanes (rice and pieces of chicken wrapped in banana leaves), tamales, chicken soups and other dishes. She prepares all these dishes in her home, to later sell them as a street vendor, walking along the streets of her neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nShe got started with 10 nuevos soles of working capital, selling motes sancochados (individual grains of corn boiled with cilantro) which she sold door to door. She saved her earnings little by little and invested them in the preparation of juanes, winning the preference of her customers, who wait for her daily because of the good service she offers them. Up to now she works on her own. \r\n\r\nShe considers her business profitable because of the earnings it provides, and the regular clientele that over time, she has learned to win over. Before starting her business she had financial difficulties, as she had separated from the father of her children. She needed an income to be able to feed them, as the support her husband gave her wasn't enough; and also to help them them have a trade, and give them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nSeeing the good results, she has plans to continue with her business, and with the profits buy a transportation vehicle to rent out and generate more income for herself.\r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with the MFP institution. She feels happy to know that she will have a line of credit to move forward with her business. That is why she states that she will be responsible in making her installment payments, as with her previous loans. In addition, she says that she likes working with her communal bank, because of the help they offer people in accessing a line of credit.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested amount of 1,500 nuevos soles, together with her own capital, to invest in the purchase of a second-hand mototaxi valued at 2,000 nuevos soles. This is in order to rent it out and generate more income for herself, as well as save herself transportation expenses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1013213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy a mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":89.75,"local_amount":234.12,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":240.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401333,"comment":null},{"amount":485.25,"local_amount":1265.88,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1300.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456658,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T22:51:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397425,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to invest in beauty supplies for new services.

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his wife and two children in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He breeds cattle and has 12 years of experience in this field. \r\n\r\nCattle breeding requires a lot of physical activity and spending most of the time in the open air. Pasturing takes 80% of Rahman`s time. He usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months and then resells for a more profitable price in the livestock bazaar. His monthly income is 200 AZN and this business is the only source of financial income in his family.

She takes pride in the knowledge that her small business has made it possible for them to move money easily and safely. \r\n\r\nTina has many dreams for her future.

He has gone from only 10 transactions a day to an impressive 60. He has since managed to employ one person to help him in his shop. Paul describes his life as difficult; he is quick to say that he has not had it easy in life due to being orphaned at the young age of 10. He has not been able to pursue his education, but is grateful for the opportunity he has to run his own business and therefore gives it all he can. \r\n\r\nPaul's appeal to his lenders is that they help him raise the money so that he can let his customers send larger amounts of money. He has dreams of opening more mobile money outlets in his town. \r\n\r\nIn this video, Paul is interviewed by a representative from Mobile Transactions. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4950,"image":{"id":1014648,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2551,"youtubeId":"YkdnC3aXemc","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Paul from  Zambia","thumbnailImageId":1014648},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To increase his working capital so that customers can send large amounts of money from his shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Kabwe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":4950,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":26000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":4950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":26000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":492.36,"local_amount":2586125,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2592020.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283208775,"comment":null},{"amount":500.83,"local_amount":2630625,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2636622.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287634826,"comment":null},{"amount":509.68,"local_amount":2677125,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2683228.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294480093,"comment":null},{"amount":587.62,"local_amount":3086500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3093536.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301533503,"comment":null},{"amount":644.98,"local_amount":3387750,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-30T08:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3395473.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308301565,"comment":null},{"amount":842.33,"local_amount":4424375,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4434461.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533403,"comment":null},{"amount":895.78,"local_amount":4705125,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4715851.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323132505,"comment":null},{"amount":476.42,"local_amount":2502375,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2508079.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281399,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

However, she only lives with two of them as her eldest left home to go and work outside the city.  They live in their own home in the small village of Cumutay, in Huasahuasi district.  Juana is an exemplary woman.  When the father of her children left her to bring them up on her own, she had to make a supreme effort to face her problems which were mainly financial.  \r\n\r\nJuana has been farming for 20 years.  She started out growing potatoes, peas and corn.  Over all these years, she has learned about the weather and the diseases that can affect her crops.  However, as she is intelligent, she knows how to deal with these problems.  Juana also raises two donkeys and some sheep and pigs.  In spite of all her responsibilities, she still has time to keep her home, her land and her pens clean.  She is certain that her work is profitable but it depends a lot on the care that she takes of her crops and how she sells them.\r\n\r\nJuana is a member of the 'Lindo Amanecer de Cumutay' community bank and this will be her tenth loan from MFP thanks to your help.

Thanks to the knowledge she gained from her parents as a child, she has been able to carry out her farming activities with skill.  She currently grows carrots, onions, gladioli and other flowers such as 'sarita' (small white flowers).  She also grinds grains and cereals such as peas, beans, corn, etc.  She has been in this new business for three years and it is going very well.  Judith comments that in order to grind her grains she bought a machine which makes the work easier.  \r\n\r\nJudith manages her time wisely so that she doesn't neglect either her crops or her business.  As if this weren't enough, she also runs a small grocery store which is located in her own home.  This is how she is able to ensure a good quality of life for her family and easily cover their basic needs.  She now hopes to acquire more land so that she can improve her vegetable production and stock her store with goods.\r\n\r\nThis will be Judith's 11th loan from MFP.  She gives her word that she will make her monthly repayments on time.  Judith is a member of the 'Sarita Colonia' community bank and she enjoys sharing activities with other responsible people like herself.  She will invest her money in two equal sums.

Pertenece al banco comunal \u201cUni\u00f3n por el trabajo\u201d y le gusta ser parte de un grupo s\u00f3lido y responsable. De recibir el pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 comprar 20 sacos de papas, los que comercializar\u00e1 en la ciudad de La Oroya.\n\n","en":"Marcelina, age 25, has lived with her life partner for five years.  They have a five year old son, Admir.  They live in their own house in the Cay\u00e1n settlement in the Huasahuasi district.  Marcelina grew up surrounded by crops and open fields.  This is the way she learned to work the land and to get the most from her production.\r\n\r\nShe started planting potatoes and peas.  Now that she has her own family she grows smaller quantities of potatoes.  Her main job is buying and selling potatoes.  She gets her merchandise in her zone because the potatoes from Cay\u00e1n are in great demand.  She transports the sacks to the city of La Oroya.  Her sister lives there, so she saves a lot in food and lodging.  She has a sales stand in that city.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery week I take 30 sacks of Andean potatoes, which are the ones that sell the most,\u201d she says.  Marcelina is a businesswoman, and she is almost always traveling.  This way she has neglected her other parcels of land.  Now she only has one, which she does not neglect because of the investment she made.\r\n\r\nThis is the way that she looks for financial stability in order to support her son and to provide him with comforts that she was not able to have when she was young.\r\n\r\nThis will be Marcelina\u2019s sixth loan with MFP.  She is happy to work with this entity that supports her entrepreneurial process.  She belongs to the Uni\u00f3n por el Trabajo communal bank.  She likes being part of a supportive and responsible group.  Upon receiving the loan she will be able to buy 20 sacks of potatoes, which she will sell in the city of La Oroya.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1016837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy 20 sacks of potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":178.56,"local_amount":476.15,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":478,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451401,"comment":null},{"amount":196.44,"local_amount":523.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":525.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447806,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T03:44:23Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398041,"name":"Magda Denis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Magda tiene 48 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera de 3 hijos de 13,16 y 19 a\u00f1os, reside en el Municipio de Azacualpa, Santa Barbar\u00e1.\nAnteriormente se dedicaba a la venta de cacahuate (mani), con las ganancias obtenidas decidi\u00f3 establecer el negocio de venta de mercader\u00eda de manera ambulante (calzado para damas, caballeros, ni\u00f1os y ropa interior).

He previously had some difficulties like the lack of capital to invest in his crops, but thanks to working with MFP he was able to gradually get ahead.\r\n\r\nWith these activities he is able to assure his children and his wife of a decent quality of life with a look towards making progress.  He now is thinking of leasing more land in order to produce more potatoes and peas.\r\n\r\nThis will be his eleventh loan with MFP.  He pledges to make his monthly payments punctually.  He belongs to the R\u00edo Blanco communal bank.  It pleases him to share experiences with his companions who are as responsible as he is.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the loan he will be able to buy one bag of pea seeds.  With the rest he will buy organic fertilizers (farmyard guano) in order to guarantee their growth.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1016844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a bag of pea seeds and sacks of fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869244,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T20:58:55Z","paid_date":"2013-04-19T09:22:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398951,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is a single woman.

He is married and has three children (ages 9, 5, and 2).  Carlos works very hard because he wants to protect his family and provide them a better quality of life.  He also takes care of his own home, which he was able to build thanks to a gift of land from his father.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarlos has a job that consists of transporting cargo and passengers within and outside of the city.  When passengers want to reach their destination safe and sound, Carlos offers them a ride.  One of his virtues is that he is very careful.  He has the necessary experience for transporting potential passengers and dealing with any difficulties.  Carlos has been in this line of work for 18 years.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe enjoys his work because it allows him to have time to spend with his family.  In addition, he is able to take his children to school and to different places as needed.  Carlos remembers starting out in this line of work at a very young age.  Over time, he gained experience as a result of the days of work that were sometimes uncomfortable because of the intense heat of the sun or the heavy rains that would inundate some parts of the city.  Carlos hopes to continue working   and supporting his family without problems so that they can grow.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his third loan with MFP.  Carlos is very pleased to know that he will have financial support since he is confident that he will advance his business.  In addition, he promises once again to complete his payments just as he did with his previous loans.  He is grateful to be part of his Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive people.

husband and two small children live in the town of Belaya Tserkov, not far from Kiev.  She sells vegetables, fruits, seeds for planting and also tools for gardening and farming.  Nataliya wisely included a small add-on cost to the products she sells.  A combination of factors, such as a good, well-traveled place of business, heating in the kiosk, where vegetables and fruits for sale are stored, working directly with product suppliers, give Nataliya certain advantages in running the business as compared to her competitors.

She lives here with her two beloved daughters, 21-year-old Yanina and 16-year-old Yuli, who she is devoted to.  Thanks to her perseverance and, above all, the hard work she does, Elizabeth managed to buy a rice-hulling machine.  She has been in this business for 20 years now and it is very easy for her to carry out her work as she really enjoys it.  Her main customers are people from her town who grow rice.  At harvest time they bring their crops to Elizabeth's workplace so that she can hull their sacks of rice.  Elizabeth normally works alone but she had to hire a laborer to support her in filling the grain sacks that mount up.  Over time, she would like to be able to expand her business as it is how she provides for her family, especially for her daughters' education.

He is also kind and chivalrous.  He lives with his partner Juliana who is a housewife and the mother of his three children Juan, Ami and Frank, who are 6, 2 and 1.  They live together in their own home that they bought with their savings.\r\n\r\nFrancisco works as a welder, a trade that he learned on the job when he used to work as an assistant in somebody else's metal shop.  Now he works in a friend's workshop and earns a percentage for the work that he does.  He started out in this business more than seven years ago and, up to now, he has worked in his friend's workshop.  He previously worked as a fish seller which he considered to be hard work.  He decided to change to welding because he saw that it made more profits.  He considers his work to be fairy profitable.  It makes him good money and doesn't take him much time to do.  Before he started out in this business he was experiencing financial difficulties as his previous business did not provide him with good results and he considered it hard going.  He often failed to provide for his family's needs.  However, with his new trade he is now making better profits.  He would like to use them to buy a fast food cart which his partner will work on selling fast food.  In this way, the couple will support each other in covering their household expenses and will both look to make progress.\r\n\r\nThis will be Francisco's eighth loan from MFP.  He is happy and grateful to know that he will continue having a line of credit so that he can make progress in his business.  He feels very comfortable with his community bank as he considers its members to be nice, supportive people.  Francisco will invest the sum of 1,800 soles that he has requested in buying a fast food cart so that he can establish a new business for his partner.  The cart is worth 780 soles.  He will use the remainder of the money to buy the ingredients needed to prepare fast food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1013888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a fast food cart and ingredients for preparing fast food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":269.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":287.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":286.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":308.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":320.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":328.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.19},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.19,"local_amount":269.84,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:42Z","rounded_local_amount":271.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099833,"comment":null},{"amount":107.71,"local_amount":287.23,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":288.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713963,"comment":null},{"amount":107.3,"local_amount":286.13,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":287.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202859,"comment":null},{"amount":115.73,"local_amount":308.61,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":310.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098529,"comment":null},{"amount":120.04,"local_amount":320.12,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":321.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401351,"comment":null},{"amount":123.03,"local_amount":328.07,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":329.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455655,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Also, she has a sister who helps her sewing but she doe not have material in order to be able to extend her business.

She enjoys her work because it leaves her with time to be by her children since she works at home and can watch over them all day; besides, she has good sales and earns good profits.

She\u2019s a single mother of two children but this does not detract from her joy or her desire to improve.  She lives in her mother\u2019s house and she hopes to soon improve her and her children\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nFor Catherine the business selling food is an activity that helps her earn income to provide her children with a good education.  She carries out this activity in her mother\u2019s house.  She\u2019s been in business over two years now and feels comfortable working there because she has time to do other things while being alongside her children.  What she doesn\u2019t like is that sometimes she has to extend credit to some of her diners and they make her wait for her payment but eventually they all end up paying her in good spirits.\r\n\r\nHer business is near a large firm in the city so she has a good number of customers which means good daily income.  She feels very comfortable with what she does and hopes to continue this way since it provides her with the tranquility she needs for her family.  She\u2019s now preparing to enlarge her business with more tables and chairs to provide more customer comfort.\r\n\r\nThis will be her MFP loan #2 and she\u2019s very happy because she\u2019ll have financial support to continue advancing with her business.  She commits once more to make her installment payments like she\u2019s done with previous loans.  On the other hand she mentions that she\u2019s very happy working alongside her communal bank members because they are all very responsible and mutually supportive.  She will use the requested 1500 soles to buy ingredients and supplies to continue with her business in addition to tables, chairs and utensils to provide better customer service.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1017715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food preparation ingredients as well as tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":220.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":229.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":249.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":259.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":263.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":277.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.64},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.76},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.64,"local_amount":220.81,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":226.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099871,"comment":null},{"amount":87.83,"local_amount":229.11,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":235.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714002,"comment":null},{"amount":95.76,"local_amount":249.81,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":256.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202899,"comment":null},{"amount":99.33,"local_amount":259.13,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":265.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098569,"comment":null},{"amount":101.07,"local_amount":263.65,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":270.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401409,"comment":null},{"amount":106.37,"local_amount":277.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":284.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455703,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T17:23:55Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399027,"name":"Gulnara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulnara is 36 years old.

She and her husband separated 12 years ago.  Erlinda is the mother of three grown children who are independent.  Now she only works for herself and her 13-year-old granddaughter who she is raising and providing an education.  Erlinda wants her to be a good influence on society.  During the week, Erlinda works as a seamstress, making garments of different designs.  In addition, she produces a few pillowcases, furniture covers, and bedroom sets.  She has a small space that is equipped and located in a strategic area of her house where she does all of her work.  Erlinda has been in this business for a long time.  Occasionally she receives help from her daughters or her granddaughter.  She sells what she produces on the weekends to friends, neighbors, and other customers looking to buy a high-quality bedding set at a good price.  Erlinda enjoys her work because it allows her time to take care of her animals and crops since farming is one of her favorite hobbies.  She has many plans for the future and wants to continue growing her business to make it prosper.  In the past few months, she has encountered many problems.  For example, the motorcycle taxi that she rents out was robbed.  She refuses to look back and is always moving forward to improve her situation.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her 12th loan with MFP.  Erlinda is very pleased to know that she will have financial support, which will guarantee that she can continue working peacefully.  In return, she promises to be a member who is punctual with her payments, just as she was with her previous loans.  She is also very pleased to be part of her Communal Bank since all of the members are responsible and supportive individuals.  The amount of 4000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy materials so that she can continue her work and increase her production.  In addition, she will finalize the documents for her motorcycle taxi.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1014091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy sewing materials and to finalize the purchase of a motorcycle taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":579.51},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":612.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":667.43},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":692.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":704.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":744.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":217.32,"local_amount":579.51,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":582.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099843,"comment":null},{"amount":229.53,"local_amount":612.09,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":615.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713973,"comment":null},{"amount":250.29,"local_amount":667.43,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":670.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202869,"comment":null},{"amount":263.1,"local_amount":701.59,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":705.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098539,"comment":null},{"amount":260.66,"local_amount":695.1,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":698.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401361,"comment":null},{"amount":279.1,"local_amount":744.28,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":748,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455665,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T21:53:57Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399148,"name":"Regina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina is a 56-year-old, married woman residing in Sebac, Sapang Dalaga, in the province of Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

She shares her life with her partner, living together in the home that they bought together. They also live with their 3 children who are her reason for everything she does. She provides her children with a good standard of education and hopes to provide them with a better standard of living.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda starts work early in the morning when she goes out in search of the region's freshest and best fruits. She heads to the fruit market located in the city centre where she tracks down her suppliers, who always give her their best quality produce. Later, she returns to her home where her clients are waiting to buy from her so that they can give their school-aged children their breakfasts. She works from her own home and her children help her out; her husband works as a transport driver and together they bring a decent wage into the home.\r\nIn all the time that she has been working in this role, she has learned that nothing can be wasted and she makes ice-cream and jams out of the fruits that are too ripe and close to spoiling. She likes her work as it involves her family, who help her out, and after working at her business in the mornings, she has the afternoons free. She hopes to grow her business as she has every wish and desire to exceed her own expectations.\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP, as such she is counting on their collaboration in order to continue working towards her aims. On the other hand, she is also committed once again to fulfilling the repayment schedule just as she did with her previous loan. She is very happy about being a member of her communal bank as the people involved are good, pleasant and very supportive. With the requested loan amount of 1500 NS, she will buy more fruit for her business as the start of the school year is close at hand and she wants to satisfy her clients, as well as buying bananas because the price is starting to rise and she wants to buy a larger quantity to increase her earnings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1017801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a greater range of fruits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":220.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":229.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":249.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":259.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":263.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":277.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.64},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.76},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.64,"local_amount":220.81,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":226.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099874,"comment":null},{"amount":87.83,"local_amount":229.11,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":235.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714005,"comment":null},{"amount":95.76,"local_amount":249.81,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":256.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202902,"comment":null},{"amount":99.33,"local_amount":259.13,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":265.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098572,"comment":null},{"amount":101.07,"local_amount":263.65,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":270.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401412,"comment":null},{"amount":106.37,"local_amount":277.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":284.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455706,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T12:39:56Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399151,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is from Sepac Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental.

She has been in this line of work for five years and works together with her daughter who helps her to serve her customers when she is busy with her sewing.  What she likes about her work is that she is able to carry out two activities at once.  In addition, she always has income and very good customers since she now has a contract with a fancy dress store who she supplies every week.  She hopes, in the future, to be able to expand her store and build a workshop where she can sew more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis will be Estela's ninth loan from MFP.

She lives with her partner, Rider, who works in river transport and is the father of her 3 children: Deysi, Garni and Celeste who are 16, 12 and 5 years old respectively. Together they live comfortably in their own home that they bought recently. Alejandrina sells basic essential groceries from a store which she has built in her home, where she serves customers -- mostly her neighbours -- with a pleasant and polite disposition. She also sells food in the evenings such as juanes (rice, chicken and egg wrapped in a 'bijao' leaf) and fried chicken among other items. For this purpose, she sets out a table in front of her house, which is frequented by customers who come for her great cookery. She started this as a small venture, selling in small quantities more than 14 years ago and now her children also help her out in this business.\r\nShe believes that her business is fairly profitable as she earns well from both of her businesses and they have pulled her through many difficult times.

She lives in the home of the parents of her live-in partner, with whom she has two children, aged 3 and 1. She works a lot because she wants to provide her family with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nEvelin's work is selling food. When the night begins to fall, she goes out with her table and chairs to the sidewalk in front of her home to begin her working day. The type of food she sells is very special, since she prepares it with local ingredients and supplies, it has excellent seasoning, and she knows how to treat customers so that they always want to come back. She learned all of these sales tips during her time working. At the beginning it was very complicated, but she was able to adapt and become an excellent salesperson. She has done this work for more than a year, and she does it alone because in this way she feels more comfortable, and it lets her earn a better income.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is the time that she has at her disposal during the day so that she can care for her small children. Her sales are always moderate, but she hopes that in the future she can expand her business.

Her house is located in the department of Ica.  The department of Ica is the only one on the south coast that is formed of plains.  It also has coastal prairies, since the mountain range of the Andes is far inland.  In Ica there are many deserts, such as the Pampas de Lancha and the Pampas de Villacuri, where the heat is intense.  It features beaches and hot springs, various marine fauna, site museums and excellent hotel services.  As a good Peruvian, she likes food a lot and one of her favorite dishes is the delicious \"Aji de Gallina\" (Chili Pepper Chicken).

Because of this she works hard to give her son what he needs so that he can be better than her.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of effort and more than anything all the help from her husband, Yiovanna achieved having her own business selling clothing, to which she dedicates about 10 hours a day.

She believes that her business is successful because she sells quality products at good prices and because of this her customers always return to her business.\r\n\r\nYiovanna is very thankful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to their help she will be able to buy more merchandise, and especially summer clothing.

He says that they gave the group this name because they invest all of the loans requested in their businesses so that they can give their families a better quality of life.  Tono, as he is known by his community, is 28 years old and single, and has had a garage for 6 years. He says that he learned this business because it has attracted his attention since he was a child. In secondary school he took a mechanical workshop where he learned to repair cars, and because of this he opened his own workshop.  He says that he is requesting this loan to buy tools, and that each tool is quite expensive.  He also says that he rents the land where his garage is located and which he occupies for parking and for overnight vehicle storage.  He says that his goal and his dream is to buy a large piece of land where he can put his garage and where he does not pay rent as this is money out of his pocket.  For this reason he is making great efforts to become known as a good mechanic. The other ten members of the group are also very hard-working and responsible people.  Their names are Mariana, Eva de los Milagros, Gloria, Maria del Carmen, Eva, Maricela, Lucila, Clara, Esmeralda and Esther.

Her story began when she used to drop her son off at school every morning, preferring to use a mototaxi to get there. While chatting with the drivers along the way she came to the conclusion that it's a profitable business and so she decided to get together the money to buy a vehicle and get her license. She's been working for a year now and says it's going very well. She works alone every day and crime can be a problem. She's married and has children. Her biggest dreams are to have more vehicles to put to work, to have a house built of cement, and to give her children everything they need. For that reason she's asked for the loan for her business.

There she sells basic household products and a whole range of different brands and flavors of drinks.  She is the only person who sells these types of drinks so she is well known in her town.  In addition, she also owns a bus with which she provides a public transport system on known routes in the city.  She hires a driver to take care of this business.  However, the business activity that provides her with the most financial satisfaction is making bricks in a factory that she owns.  There she works alongside assistants who she pays according to how much they produce.  She says that she makes an average of 25,000 bricks a month and sells them in a well-known market.  This is where she sees the profits she makes from her work.  Now Olga would like to see her children with a profession and would like them to become independent and strong.\r\n\r\nOlga is a member of the 'Mi Banco' community bank and this is her 18th loan from MFP.  She is grateful for your support because she will receive the loan that she needs to achieve her goals.  For her part, she pledges to make her repayments on time because the members of her community bank are responsible and supportive people.  With your support, Olga will invest the money she has requested in buying raw materials for making bricks.  If the money stretches far enough she will buy basic household products to stock her grocery store with as well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1015093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy materials for making bricks and basic household products with which to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-07T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-06T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455687,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T13:39:11Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396752,"name":"Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carmen, de 53 a\u00f1os, es una mujer alegre y trabajadora, est\u00e1 casada con su esposo hace muchos a\u00f1os, viven en su casa propia junto a su cu\u00f1ada y sus cuatro hijos que ya son mayores e independientes.

Silvio and his wife have lived together with their children in Chimor\u00e9 for many years.\n\nSilvio is a truck driver on a route that runs between provinces in the Tropic of Cochabamba area.  Like many people, he works extra hours so that he can provide his family with a better standard of living.  In an attempt to make more journeys, he suffered a traffic accident.  As he was tired, Silvio fell asleep for a few moments on a return journey.  Luckily, there were no personal injuries or material damage.  However, he ended up in a ditch in the oncoming lane and his engine suffered a blow which left it seriously damaged.  It managed to get him home but, shortly after, it stopped working.  Silvio has other debts that he pays off each month.  If he doesn't manage to fix his engine, he will be left without his main source of income and will fall further into debt.\n\nSilvio's wife works as a seamstress and makes a low income.  Right now, Silvio needs a small loan with interest that he can afford to pay so that he can restore his vehicle and thereby keep working.  This will enable him to pay his debts and support his family as he has always done.  For this reason, he came to us to request a loan because he found out about our Kiva loans.  Silvio was very interested to learn about this type of loan and the fact that he could benefit from them.\n\nSilvio hopes that his children will enjoy a better future.

Some years ago, Tatiana was trained as a beautician and personal care specialist in an academy in the city. And with the little resources she had, Tatiana took advantage of her knowledge, installing a beauty salon in her home. She performs diverse services there: tinting, hair cuts, and nail painting, among other things. She works from Monday through Saturday, from 8:00 am until 8:00 pm, and at times, even later if her customers require her services. Also, Tatiana sells products, beauty treatments, and cosmetics in her shop.

In search of a financing source for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1997 with a purchase of livestock with 50,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Khalida's hard work, her business, containing two cows and ten sheep, yields about 12,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and meat products.  In order to further expand her business, Khalida requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy two dairy cows.
