She is married and lives in a village of Ozurgeti district with her husband, son and father. The main income for Teona is her grocery store, selling different types of groceries. It has been a profitable project, but also it needs more support to further develop. Several times she has asked for loans from local financial institutions to develop her business, but without success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of the low income. Teona\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business startups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Teona will cover the costs of purchasing needed stock of basic groceries that customers often request. She plans to increase the turnover in her trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Teona will work hard, and she will be able to improve the living conditions for her family. With this loan, her family will generate enough income to access regular available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event that they need

She is the main breadwinner for her family since her husband is a immigrant worker in Russia.  Her sons also work in Russia.  Shahnoza runs her business alone.  She buys cattle, fattens them over a few months and then resells them at a local market at a higher price.  She must marry two of her sons, however her home is small and there aren't additional rooms for her sons and their wives.  She plans to build a new home for her sons.  She is asking for a loan of 5,000 KGS to buy construction materials such as cement, wood, sand, etc.  She awaits your kindness and relies on your compassion.

For additional income, he and his wife breed livestock at their home--they have cows and calves.  Abduaziz wants to sell a cow and with the profits, he plans to buy two calves.  However, since his cow is still producing milk, he doesn't want to sell it just yet.  His income from his job is not enough to buy a cow, so he decided to take out a loan with Arvand.  He plans to increase his herd and expand his business.  Fattening cows provides good profits.  Abduaziz's oldest son helps his parents with their business.  He is very glad that, with the help of Arvand, he may continue developing his business and achieve his goals for the future.

He learned this from his father since he used to send him to care for the animals and do farm chores when he was a little boy; he also learned how to build metal structures but there isn\u2019t much work in that.  Because of the poverty level they found themselves in they found in field work their only source of income to support the family.  Rudy was never sent to school so his probability of finding a good job is remote which is why he spends all his time caring for his calves and his crops to insure that his family does not lack food even if it\u2019s only rice and beans.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy his calves he must take a bus in is community that several people use to go buy.  He travels for 45 minutes and when he gets to the market he has to choose the animals he likes which can sometimes take all day.  When he finds the calves he has to find a truck to take them to his community; he loads the animals and returns home.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy four grazing calves to fatten up, to increase his herd size so that he can continue selling animals once they have been fattened up.  In this way his income will increase because it\u2019s logical that if the sale of calves is continuous so too will his income be greater and this will help so that his family will at least have their food assured as well as the repayment of the loan.

","en":"Oltin is a woman with a kind spirit and bright personality.  She was born in 1960 in a rural area.  She was born and grew up in a poor family.  since her childhood, she has helped her parents work in agriculture.  Therefore, she has much experience in the field since farming is still her main source of income.  For more than 20 years this has been her business alone.  Oltin mostly grows watermelon, rice and corn.  She also works with livestock since the income from farming isn't enough to provide for the family.  she is married and has three children.

","en":"Azamat is an enterprising, young man of 23 years. He is married, but does not yet have children. Azamat resides with his wife and parents in the village district of Shahrituz. Azamat decided to start a cattle breeding business, namely in raising beef cattle. This is a very profitable business, as the costs for caring for cattle are small and the demand for meat and meat products is consistently high.\r\n\r\nAzamat has a business plan for cattle breeding. He plans to buy five heads of cattle each month, to fatten them for one month and then to put them out for sale at the local cattle market. Azamat works in a micro-deposit organization and has an accumulated savings of 2,100 somoni. However, in order to realize his objective, this sum is not sufficient and so he turned to HUMO for a loan. With the accumulated savings and loan, he wants to get five heads of cattle and their feed. \r\n\r\nAzamat promises to repay the loan on time. His parents, who have a lot of experience in this area, will help run the business. This loan will help Azamat to start his own family business and to significantly improve their quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":105.11,"image":{"id":1385677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy five heads of cattle and feed in order to start a livestock business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-07-12T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-11T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Azamat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":105.11,"local_amount":105.11,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030184,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-09T14:49:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":581640,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a married man with four children, all of whom still attend school and are under his care.

","en":"Takhmina is an inhabitant of the town of Konibodom. She is 29 years old. She is divorced and lives with her two daughers at her parents' home. Takhmina has a specialized secondary education. By profession, she is a seamstress. For more than nine years, Takhmina has been sewing women's national dresses and gowns. She takes orders from her home. Since she sews beautifully, efficiently and quickly, she has many customers. \r\n\r\nAt the same time,  Takhmina teaches those who wish to know how to cut and sew at the training center. Currently, Takhmina wants to expand her activities. She is requesting a loan to purchase a computerized sewing machine and fabric, and also partly for home renovations. \r\n\r\nTakhmina knows how to do embroidery on dresses and now wants to put her skills into practice. Since dresses with embroidery are more expensive, Takhmina will generate more income from her activities that will allow her to improve living conditions and to promote her activities further. Thanks to the loan, Takhmina will expand her activities and repair her

He thinks that it is going well for him because of his good prices and friendly customer service.\r\nMarco is very grateful to the Kiva lenders; thanks to their help he will be able to make repairs to his home. He wants to buy construction materials in order to repair the roof and install a concrete floor. In doing so, Marco will provide his family with better security and well-being. He will keep working hard to achieve his great dream of having his own storefront for his carwash business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":164.86,"image":{"id":1387267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to make repairs to his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-07-12T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-11T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marco Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":71.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":77.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":87.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":92.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":102.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.05,"local_amount":66.79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":69.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776421,"comment":null},{"amount":25.58,"local_amount":68.21,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":70.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779378,"comment":null},{"amount":26.64,"local_amount":71.06,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":73.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054573,"comment":null},{"amount":28.17,"local_amount":75.12,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":78.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819473,"comment":null},{"amount":28.94,"local_amount":77.17,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":80.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472416,"comment":null},{"amount":30.48,"local_amount":81.28,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":84.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694895,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T19:45:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":582342,"name":"Rosario Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosario, vive en la ciudad de Managua, casada madre de 2 hijos casada.

He is married and lives with his wife and son in a small village in Sagarejo district. Murtuzali requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start a family business, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMurtuzali is an artisan who works on private orders. In addition he is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has a milking cow and two calves, whose milk is used to make cheese products. They sell cheese at local markets for a good price. It is barely enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMurtuzali requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-up and re-startup with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

Mher is also a great patriot. For three years, he took part in the defensive battles of his village Srashen as a volunteer.

She also supports five grandchildren, two of whom have lost their fathers and three have lost their mothers.\r\nWith this amount she wishes to purchase cement, beams, windows, doors and metal sheets in order to build the roofing for her new house. It has two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom.\r\nShe wishes to finish building her new house and move in, because the place where she lives only has a bedroom and a living room which also serves as a kitchen, and she finds it too cramped. After she finishes the new house, she'll start renting out the old one as a way of increasing her family's income.\r\nShe states that her biggest challenge is lacking funds. She states that she'll repay the loan in a timely fashion so she can request more loans again in order to achieve her plan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":210.56,"image":{"id":1388533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase cement, beams, windows, doors and metal sheets in order to continue building her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2013-07-13T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-12T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":960.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1085.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1130.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1177.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1226.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1277.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1330.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1386.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1443.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1504.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1566.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1632.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1700.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1770.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1844.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1921.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.43},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.24},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.1,"local_amount":2326.39,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390586988,"comment":null},{"amount":27.18,"local_amount":799.48,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":809.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399831371,"comment":null},{"amount":51.95,"local_amount":1527.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1546.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410106786,"comment":null},{"amount":52.33,"local_amount":1539.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1557.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419871788,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T10:51:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":583383,"name":"Faustino","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Sr. Faustino de 27 anos de idade, \u00e9 casado e vive na sua pr\u00f3pria casa.

One of the animals on his farm has been given the name Nyang'era.\r\n\r\nJoseph chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because it meets his financial needs.

When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Joseph said that it will be a source of capital to improve their living standard.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Joseph owns the following: a cow, poultry, and a motorcycle. He does not own a pig, a pump, a bicycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. Joseph has in his household a mosquito net, solar power, a TV, and a DVD player, but he does not have electricity, running water, or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":144.17,"image":{"id":1386070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-07-13T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-12T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2243.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2303.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2363.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2426.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2490.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2556.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2623.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2693.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2764.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2837.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2912.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2989.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.43,"local_amount":1450.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1514.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417409,"comment":null},{"amount":27.81,"local_amount":2313.62,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2415.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980928,"comment":null},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":2374.78,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2478.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880977,"comment":null},{"amount":40.03,"local_amount":3330.55,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3476.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529594,"comment":null},{"amount":30.36,"local_amount":2525.59,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2636.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753466,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T23:20:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":581780,"name":"Pola","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pola is married and has three children, all of whom attend school and are under her care.

","en":"Gulruhsor is 46 year old. She is a conscientious and hard working woman. Gulruhsor has a wonderful family. She is married and is raising four children. One of her children is an adult, while the other three are still underage. Gulruhsor is the main provider for the family and she works tirelessly to earn money and provide her family with all the necessities. She has been selling children's clothes for 8 years. She has a lot of experience and steadily develops her business. Gulruhsor has a retail stall at the local market and tries to sell beautiful and well-made children's clothes. She needs to refresh her inventory for the upcoming season but has no money.

Last time she took out a loan Galina faced a decrease in customer demand, but thanks to the loan she was able to purchase clothes in a large batch and she received a big discount on the whole sale price, thus saving money. This time Galina has turned for a loan of 5,000 griven to purchase clothing for resale, specifically t-shirts and blouses.

ayudar en el negocio de la familia en el mercado local. Martha se cas\u00f3 muy joven, matrimonio del cual nacieron su hijos a quienes despu\u00e9s de una dura pero inevitable separaci\u00f3n, tuvo que educarlos sola a veces neg\u00e1ndose el sustento para s\u00ed misma, pero su esfuerzo vali\u00f3 la pena, pues sus hijos son independientes y lo aprendido lo han puesto en pr\u00e1ctica para desenvolverse en su caminar. Cuando Martha se cas\u00f3, se traslad\u00f3 a Quito la capital de los ecuatorianos, en donde actualmente vive con una de sus hijas, espec\u00edficamente en el barrio llamado \u201cChillogallo\u201d ubicado al sur de la ciudad, sector que hasta hace pocos a\u00f1os no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles, un sector en el cual su alta actividad comercial es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios.\nMartha siempre se ha dedicado a la comercializaci\u00f3n de frutas y verduras, sin embargo hace 5 a\u00f1os encontr\u00f3 un lugar en el mercado local, en donde va a ofertar sus productos los d\u00edas de feria es decir martes, viernes y s\u00e1bado. Esto ha incrementado sus ventas pero ha demandado de ella un mayor esfuerzo, pues a su edad el traslado de los bultos llenos de frutas y verduras, es m\u00e1s complicados de trasladarse, pues ella debe tener un especial cuidado por el tema de su salud. Martha utiliza los conocimientos obtenidos de su preparaci\u00f3n primaria para llevar a cabo su negocio. Invierte cada d\u00eda varias horas para hacer los pedidos respectivos a sus proveedores y hacer las ventas respectivas y mucho tiempo m\u00e1s en los d\u00edas de feria. En los \u00faltimos d\u00edas ha percibido una falta de variedad en sus productos, pues muchos de sus clientes tienen que completar su canasta en otros puestos del mercado. Por esta raz\u00f3n, Martha ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo con el fin de invertir en nuevos productos y as\u00ed ampliar su negocio, adem\u00e1s as\u00ed podr\u00eda obtener el dinero adicional tener un lugar m\u00e1s grande dentro del mercado. Martha afirma que muchas veces este sue\u00f1o no pudo ser posible por la falta de capital y adem\u00e1s por la dificultad y obst\u00e1culos que ponen las instituciones financieras, por el contrario Martha encontr\u00f3 en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa el apoyo para su microempresa, de tal forma que se sinti\u00f3 importante tanto para su ejecutivo de cuenta como para la entidad.  Ella estuvo de acuerdo en aplicar al producto de Kiva para que as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n pueda sentir el apoyo de varias personas alrededor del mundo que todav\u00eda creen en los sue\u00f1os y esfuerzo de las personas del sector \u201cmicro\u201d.","en":"Martha is a 63-year-old woman. She grew up in the country with her family. Her father always made her participate and help in the family business in the local market. Martha married very young, and from her marriage came her children, who are now independent of her after a difficult but inevitable parting. She had to educate them by herself and sometimes did not have enough to eat, but her effort was worth it and they have learnt to fend for themselves. When Martha married, she moved to Quito, the capital of Ecuador, and she currently lives there with one of her daughters in the neighbourhood called \u201cChillogallo\u201d in the southern part of the city. This area was not counted among the strong economic areas of the capital of the Republic of Ecuador until recently, but it is now considered an economic force in the capital. It is here that you can find enterprising families who have fought to get ahead. It has been the meeting point between inhabitants of various provinces, natives, and immigrants from other cities and countries. It has been rebuilt to have wide streets. The high commercial activity of this area is constantly strengthening and it contributes greatly to the economic growth of the city. There are also large parks in this zone, where families meet during the weekend. There is great accessibility to all types of services and the inhabitants are enterprising and take every opportunity that presents itself to establish new businesses.\r\n\r\nMartha has always made a living by selling fruit and vegetables; however, five years ago she found a place in a local market, where she sells her produce on market days (Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday). This has increased her sales but it requires more effort on her part. At her age transporting the packages full of fruit and vegetables is more complicated, and she must take special care of her health. Martha uses the knowledge she learnt in primary school to run her business. She invests several hours each day in making orders to her suppliers and making sales, and more time on market days. She has recently noticed a lack of variety in her produce and that many of her clients have to complete their shopping at other stalls in the market. For this reason, Martha has requested a loan with the goal of investing in new products and expanding her business, thereby enabling her to obtain additional money in order to get a larger place in the market. Martha states that many times this dream was not possible due to the lack of capital and because of the difficulties and obstacles financial institutions put in place. With Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, Martha found the support for her microbusiness in such a way that she felt important for both being the account executor and to the entity. She agreed to apply to Kiva so that she could also feel the support of various people around the world who still believe in the dreams and efforts of people in the \u201cmicro\u201d sector."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":451.21,"image":{"id":1387929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to expand her food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-13T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-12T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Martha Maria Diocelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1134.75,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":71.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75.39},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":76.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":79.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":84.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":84.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":87.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":92.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.06,"local_amount":70.12,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":71.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565429,"comment":null},{"amount":72.59,"local_amount":71.63,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":72.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814466,"comment":null},{"amount":74.16,"local_amount":73.17,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":74.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320639,"comment":null},{"amount":76.81,"local_amount":75.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":76.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856328,"comment":null},{"amount":77.4,"local_amount":76.37,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":77.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059904,"comment":null},{"amount":79.19,"local_amount":78.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":79.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995240,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T22:45:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":581991,"name":"Phina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phina is a widow with one child who attends school.

She has two children who are of school-going age. She has been farming for eight years. Her main sources of income are maize, cow peas, potatoes and beans. The challenge she faces is that of poor climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of KES 60,000 from Juhudi Kilimo for the purchase of a water tank for storing water for farming activities.

","en":"Rahbar has been in business for around 15 years. She sews national robes and mattresses (\"kurpachi'). She learned the craft from her mother. Her sister helps her sew robes and mattresses since it is such manual and time-intensive work. Rahbar also sells fish, both fresh and smoked. She trades in the market every day, because on certain days clients come to her to place orders for fresh fish. Rahbar is a very responsible and kind woman.\r\n\r\nRahbar's husband works baking bread in a different region where there is a lot of demand for his bread.  Because of this, he stays there for 2-3 weeks at a time and on alternate days he is replaced by his partner.\r\n\r\nRahbar wants to do some home repairs.

been raising cattle for over 25 years. Even when he was very young, he helped his parents take care of cattle. Similarly, his children now help him by bringing feed, herding cattle in the pasture and milking cows. Abduvali's wife stays at home, but seasonally, from July to November, she buys grapes from farmers, stores them in a refrigerated warehouse and sells them on the market. While Abduvali's sons herd cattle in the pasture, he goes to work as a painter. The livestock gives Abduvali's family a good income, so the whole family is working on growing the business.\r\n\r\nSince his pasture is full of grass and lot of diverse food, Abduvali plans to buy another pair of cows for additional breeding.

She lives in the Terjola District with her husband and two children. The family runs a small dairy farm of two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. The cheese is sold at the local open market. Besides dairy farming, Nineli works very hard on her own piece of land where she grows different kinds of vegetables. Her products are very good quality, and she sells the harvests at the different markets that are close to where she lives.\r\n\r\nAll of the family members work hard, but the income is not enough for covering the everyday expenses. So, Nineli decided to start up a new business. She has requested loans from her local financial institutions several times without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Nineli will build a greenhouse.

Gulnora, as she lives in a rural area together with her family, works with livestock breeding. She has worked with this business for 10 years already. She has a large experience and teaches her children this business. Her children, Burkhon, Oyzoda, Khudoyberdi and Rahmonberdi, and also her husband Rauf, help her with managing the business. This business is the main source of income for her large family and their only hope for the future. \r\n\r\nGulnora started building a new house several years ago, for her eldest son and his future wife. She would like to marry away her son, but first she should finish the house. Gulnora plans to complete the building before the winter. With this aim she applied for a loan, in order to purchase cement, wood, brick, armature and so on. She requests a loan in the amount of 3,000 US dollar.
