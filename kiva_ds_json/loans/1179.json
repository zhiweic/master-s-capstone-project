She lives with her partner and has four children. She is very experienced at managing her business, which she has had for ten years. Before opening this shop, she was a seamstress, but did not have enough customers to make a living from that trade alone. She learned how to manage a shop entirely on her own, since she had to take care of her children and did not have a steady income on which to live. At first, she had problems finding merchandise, so she started out on a very small scale. However, she has since managed to grow gradually, in order to meet customer demand. Nowadays, the shop has everything a customer needs, and is open from 5 in the morning to 9 in the evening. In order to buy supplies for her shop, Patricia needs to take a bus ride from where she lives to the city, which is approximately 45 minutes away. There, she buys what she needs in a wholesale shop, and takes the bus back home.

","en":"Mirzo is a 48 year old widower with five children. After his wife died, it was very difficult for him to raise the kids, ages 24, 14, 13, 10, and 7. Mirzo tries to provide his children with good living conditions so that they do not feel that they have no mother. Mirzo has been a butcher since 1992 and sells meat from sheep. He buys the sheep and slaughters them himself to sell to local residents and always tries to provide his customers with fresh meat. He has several regular customers at the local market. Mirzo wants to expand his business and has asked for a loan of 5000 somoni to buy more sheep. He awaits your kindness and hopes for your mercy."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":395.89,"image":{"id":1396313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"To

They sell the harvested products and cheese at local markets at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nVazha requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Vazha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this loan, Vazha will purchase two additional milking cows with which he will be able to produce more cheese to sell. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":192.16,"image":{"id":1397669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase two milking cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tskaltubo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vazha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":92.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":94.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":105.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":108.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":110.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.69},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.47,"local_amount":54.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":55.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857632,"comment":null},{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":61.4,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":62.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134283,"comment":null},{"amount":39.64,"local_amount":64.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":65.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107864,"comment":null},{"amount":39.71,"local_amount":64.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":65.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255398,"comment":null},{"amount":41.73,"local_amount":68.13,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":69.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019528,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T20:39:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588416,"name":"Paulinah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paulinah is a Kiva borrower who describes herself as dedicated, visionary, and honest.

Because he does not want to burden his parents, Agustinus applied for a loan to Kiva to cover the cost of his studies.\r\n\r\nAgustinus is very grateful to the lenders who will help him with his studies, although not known to him."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1394491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay education fees for three years","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"CILACAP","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":253,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T17:30:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T17:30:22Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-12T20:21:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586628,"name":"Daud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Commercial Shipping and Harbor Management is the study program selected by Daud.

Seated just south of the equator, the Rwandan sky is pitch-black each evening at 6pm, and seeing lights glowing from inside a home is a rarity. \n\nIn Rwanda, just 11% of people have access to electricity, which means 8 million rural households use smoky, asthma-inducing and inefficient kerosene to light their homes. Without access to reliable energy, children often walk for hours to gather firewood instead of attending school, and adults lack reliable ways to charge the phones that keep them in touch with family or the market. Light for homework becomes prohibitively expensive, and rural hospital power outages put lives in danger. \n\nRwanda-based Great Lakes Energy (GLE) provides low-cost and environmentally friendly solar energy products that bring electricity to those most in need, but they need your support to improve their reach to the most vulnerable.  \n\nFounded by Sam, an American who has been living in Rwanda for the past decade, GLE and its team of Rwandans provides clean electricity to rural consumers, healthcare centers, orphanages and schools throughout Rwanda. \n\nCurrently, the team runs its Rwanda-wide operations using outdated paper systems and a few old computers.  Up until now, GLE has focused its investments solely on its solar products, improving technologies to drive down costs for their consumers.  However, with outdated systems and IT equipment, GLE is struggling to keep up with existing clients and meet the demands of new clients in the larger market.\n\nRight now, when the team installs solar panels at rural hospitals to give doctors access to stable light to perform examinations and patients access to life-saving machines, they plan installations on paper drawings and schedules because their computers are too unreliable to take to the field.  Detailed records are extremely difficult to maintain, risking missing vital maintenance checks, which can derail the promise of the solar light.  With extra time spent keeping paper records, they are diverting key resources away from spreading access to electricity.  \n\nGLE is looking for new funding to purchase much needed IT equipment. This will allow the team to use engineering tablets and notepads to produce real-time drawings and electrical specifications. This increased efficiency will allow GLE to help more Rwandans access power, hire more local labor, and serve their customers more efficiently and accurately.  \n\nThis business innovation has real impact on people\u2019s lives: supporting GLE means supporting more rural Rwandan families to tap into the benefits of electricity that are still out of reach for too many.   With solar, health improves.  Education improves.  Rwandans save several days of earnings each month on not purchasing CO2-emitting kerosene. \n\nBut more than anything else, individual families can access the means to create better lives for themselves and their children.

44-year-old Mamie, from Moribatown in Sierra Leone. She is married, with four children between the ages of 6 and 19 years. Her children are currently attending school. \n\nIn 2008, Mamie established her clothing business. She began her business because she needed to create her own source of income, instead of depending on her husband, alone. She works at the business ten hours per day and seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.  \n\nMamie requires a loan in order to purchase more jeans, blouses, and slippers for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her children's school fees. \n\nIn the future, Mamie plans to open a shop. She thanks you for your support.\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":195.48,"image":{"id":1401453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Her greatest dream is to be able to acquire land on which to build her own house.\r\n\r\nAna has worked since she was a girl; she combined work with elementary school studies and was able to complete it acquiring basic skills that would help her manage her own business.\r\n\r\nWhen Ana\u2019s first-born was born her home was full of joy but also with worry because their resources were scarce and the new family member implied increased costs.  It was at that moment that Ana put into practice what she\u2019d learned as a little girl with her mother and started making \u201cquimbolitos\u201d to sell.\r\n\r\nA \u201cquimbolito\u201d is a steamed corn and wheat flour cake wrapped in canna leaves; it\u2019s a dessert often served with coffee and many families in Ecuador make it as a traditional dish.\r\n\r\nAna invests between 8 and 10 hours daily making and selling this product; although she has a specific spot at home where customers come looking for her, Ana also goes out to offer her products in commercial and residential areas in the city in order to sell her entire daily production.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s very innovating and needs a loan to buy the ingredients used to make \u201cquimbolitos\u201d because the lack of these ingredients has led to days when production has ceased despite customer demand.  Ana\u2019s been unable to stock up on enough ingredients to make the volume she usually has available for her customers.\r\n\r\nAna hopes that with this loan she\u2019ll be able to produce a larger amount and also to have the necessary ingredients in stock so that production can always proceed.  Also, buying at wholesale allows her to access larger discounts and this savings generates higher profits with which she can provide her family with a better lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":527.07,"image":{"id":1400937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy \"quimbolito\" ingredients at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T18:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T18:20:15Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":84.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":85.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":88.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":92.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":93.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":95.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":98.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":99.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":102.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168.43,"local_amount":167.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":168.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814484,"comment":null},{"amount":86.55,"local_amount":85.87,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":86.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320655,"comment":null},{"amount":89.02,"local_amount":88.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":89.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856343,"comment":null},{"amount":117.11,"local_amount":116.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":117.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059921,"comment":null},{"amount":65.96,"local_amount":65.45,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":65.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995254,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T21:32:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":590182,"name":"Victor Eduardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Victor 44 a\u00f1os de edad es soltero tiene dos hijos que no viven con el, Victor vive con familiares.\n\nSe dedica al comercio de grados como maiz, arveja y frajol, el dinero solicita para la compra de animales de corral como pollos y una lavadora.\n\nEl dinero del credito le ayudado a adquirir granos, balanceado, pollos y la lavadora.\n\nEl es tener dinero para ampliar el negocio\n\nEn los timepos libres le gusta reunirse con los hermanos.","en":"Victor is 44 years old and is unmarried.

My wife enjoys practicing the techniques her father taught her and eventually we realized it was better to leave the crafting to her, the designing to me. We only get one life to live, and that's why my constant challenge is to succeed every day a little bit more so I can provide a better future for my wife and family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please receive a big hug and my deepest gratitude all the way from Peru.

48-year-old Susan, from Waterloo, an eastern area in Freetown. She is married, with four children between the ages of 11 and 28 years.  \r\n\r\nSusan began her business because she wanted to create her own source of income, instead of depending on her husband. In 2000, Susan established her general stock business. She works at the business from 8:00am until 6:00pm, Monday through Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nSusan requires a loan in order to purchase gallons of cooking oil, to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to take care of her family's welfare and to buy a piece of land. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Susan plans to own the biggest shop in the community. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1397783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

30-year-old Kadiatu, from Waterloo Eastern area of Freetown. She is married and has two children, ages 3 and 10 years. She began her business, because she wants to create her own source of income instead of depending on her husband. In 2011, Kadiatu established her general stock business.  She works at the business from 8:00am until 6:00pm, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to purchase more items to sell, like cigarettes, soft drinks, and milk. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and buy a piece of land. In the future, Kadiatu plans to own the biggest shop in the community. She thanks you for your

The 14-year-old helps with the family farming operation, and the 12-year-old is currently in school. Sara learned various farming techniques from her husband, and they now work together to plant, prune, clean, fertilize and water their land and coffee crops. Since they do not have a car, Sara and her husband have to walk an hour daily just to reach their coffee plants. When they have harvested the coffee beans, they sell them to nearby storehouses and neighbors.\r\n\r\nWith the support from this loan, Sara plans to purchase agricultural inputs for tending her coffee plants.

Only two live at home and are currently attending school. The last grade she finished before getting down to business is grade 1. For the past ten years she has been selling rice, peppers, sugar, candy, tomatoes, etc. in the local market. \r\n\r\nMartha started this business with money given to her by her husband. She enjoys her business because the business gives her more money.  She sells six days a week, from 7 am to 5 pm, and most of the time she uses a taxi to get her goods to her shop. She is requesting a loan to purchase more rice, peppers, sugar, candy, tomatoes, etc. for her business.

meet 38-year-old Felecia from St. Paul in Liberia. St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for its fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nFelecia completed 8th grade and is married.  Her husband is a pastor.  She has three children between the ages of 17 and 10. Her three children are in school and they all live at home. \r\n\r\nFelecia has owned her own 'table business' (a small food stall) selling milk, eggs, soft drinks, etc. for the past four years.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase milk, eggs, soft drinks, etc.  \r\n\r\nOn average, she works 7 hours a day at her business.  She started her business with money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by taxi.  She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge.  Her favorite part of her business is the profit.  In the future, she would like to build a shop. \r\n \r\nShe thanks you in advance for your

","en":"Javier is 31 years old and is married to Vilma, who is 28 years old.  They have one son who was born 3 years ago.  Javier lives with his family in the house of his father-in-law Jorge, who has been a great source of support for them and who also works in agriculture.  They live in Alaquez, a parish in the rural region of Latacunga which preserves the history of several of the original cultures of Ecuador.  In the middle of the countryside, in an area with a cool climate, are many farming families who work the land in order to grow the best possible fruit. Javier learned the work of agriculture when he was a child from his mother, who supported him through primary school.  Although Javier would have liked to continue with his education, he began working in the fields, with the dream of one day owning his own home where his family could enjoy a comfortable place to live.  Five years ago this hardworking man decided to specialize in the production of potatoes.  He works at this activity for 8 hours every day starting very early, so that the meticulous care that he devotes to his crops each day will result in a product of high quality without any loss of plants.  Thus he will avoid losses and ensure the loyalty of his customers. The special care that Javier provides to his land and crops requires supplies, such as fertilizer, that he must buy wholesale in order to properly care for his crops.  For this reason he is requesting a loan with which he will be able to make this purchase and thus move forward with his work, which supports his family.

He has received support from loans to improve his business, and that's what motivated him to request his fifth loan, which he will invest by purchasing supplies in bulk ($1.500.000 worth of corn and $500.000 worth of charcoal) to take advantage of the discount that he receives. This way, he will have raw materials available to fill the pending orders and increase his income.\r\n\r\nAntonio dreams of expanding his business, reaching many more customers, and offering a very high-quality product that satisfies their needs and tastes.

Valle Hermoso es una parroquia rural en donde hay aproximadamente siete mil habitantes, es el escenario para los amantes de los deportes extremos, pues sus cascadas y r\u00edos son los recursos naturales m\u00e1s adecuados para esto. Es un sitio con clima c\u00e1lido y sus habitantes tienen un esp\u00edritu emprendedor impresionante, pues aprovechan el clima para explotar la actividad agr\u00edcola con la cual se producen frutos como la pi\u00f1a, la palma africana, maracuy\u00e1 y palmito. Adem\u00e1s las actividades ganaderas, av\u00edcolas y porcinas son muy frecuentes en este sector. Las actividades comerciales tambi\u00e9n son muy frecuentes en el pueblo como es el caso de Luz quien desde hace algunos a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta ambulante de cosm\u00e9ticos bajo pedido de cat\u00e1logos. Luz ha ganado mucha experiencia en ventas y cobranzas, pues varias horas al d\u00eda se dedica a la visita de clientes para ofrecer sus productos o para entregar los pedidos, tambi\u00e9n recorre las largas calles de la ciudad para cobrar los saldos pendientes y tambi\u00e9n ella poder pagar a sus proveedores. La experiencia le ha ense\u00f1ado lo importante de siempre contar con aquellos productos que sus clientes, quienes en su mayor\u00eda son mujeres, m\u00e1s necesiten o usen con frecuencia, es por ello que Luz desea incrementar su negocio comprando productos al por mayor, con lo que obtendr\u00e1 mayores descuentos por parte de sus proveedores y tambi\u00e9n recibir\u00e1 premios por su compra, lo que le ayudar\u00e1 a mejorar sus utilidades y de esta forma mejorar su estilo de vida y el de su hijo, adem\u00e1s de convertirse en una microempresaria de la industria de la belleza como siempre ha sido su sue\u00f1o. La falta de capital ha sido su mayor obst\u00e1culo para que su negocio gire alrededor solo de un par de productos. Ahora gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva podr\u00e1 obtener un pr\u00e9stamo financiado por varias personas alrededor del mundo que creen en ella y con quienes Luz est\u00e1 muy agradecida. \nLuz una mujer que es l\u00edder por naturaleza, est\u00e1 al frente del Grupo \u201cEl Rosario\u201d, un grupo de 4 personas que se unieron tras el mismo objetivo; buscar apoyo para mejorar y crecer con el negocio que  emprendieron hace algunos a\u00f1os para mejorar su calidad de vida y la de sus familias.\nSus amigos emprendedores como ella; Mar\u00eda Dolores, Manuel y Dina se dedican a diferentes actividades que son el sustento para cada d\u00eda. Mar\u00eda Dolores se dedica a la crianza de cerdos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n y esta actividad le ayuda para la manutenci\u00f3n de sus 6 hijos, necesita su parte del pr\u00e9stamo para comprar cerdos y alimento para ellos.

She is single and has one son who she supports.  He is studying and they live in Valle Hermoso parish in the Santo Domingo canton in Ecuador. \nValle Hermoso is a rural parish with approximately 7,000 inhabitants. It is a good place for extreme sports lovers since its waterfalls and rivers are the natural resources most suited for this. It is a place with warm weather and the inhabitants have a very entrepreneurial spirit. They take advantage of the weather for farming and grow fruits such as pineapple, African oil palm, passion fruit and palmetto. Other popular ways to make a living  in this area are livestock, poultry and pig farming. \nSales jobs are also very frequent such as in the case of Luz, who for several years has been selling cosmetics through mail order catalogs. Luz has gained a lot of experience in sales and collections. For several hours a day she visits clients to show them her products as well as to deliver orders. She also walks the long streets of the city to collect outstanding balances and to pay her suppliers. \nExperience has taught her the importance of always depend on the products that her clients, a majority women, mostly need or use with frequency. This is why Luz would like to increase her business to buy products at whole sale. This way she will receive bigger discounts from the suppliers and also get awards for her purchases which will help her to improve her profits and in this way improve life for her and her son. \nAlso, becoming a small business woman in the cosmetics industry has always been her dream. Her biggest business hurdle has been the lack of capital and therefore only has a few products. Now, thanks to  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva ,she will be able to get a loan from several people from around the world who believe in her. Luz is very grateful. \nLuz who is a natural leader, is the head of the \u201cEl Rosario\u201d Group.  This is a four person group who united behind the same objective, find help to improve and grow with the business they learnt to do a few years ago and improve the quality of life for them and their families. \nHer entrepreneur friends, just like her, Mar\u00eda Dolores, Manuel and Dina, work different jobs in order to live day to day.\n Mar\u00eda Dolores grows pigs to sell. This helps her support her six children. She needs her part of the loan to buy pigs and feed for them. \nManuel  still works at 65, selling wood and will use his part of the loan to improve his work space and buy tools. \nDina, is a 57 year old woman who has a convenience store which has helped support her family for many years. \nThe members of this group have in common that they work hard work and they have not given up. Their personal and family motivations have made them stronger so they can keep moving ahead and fight for their dreams. \n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1395793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy products at whole sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-08-01T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-31T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel Blas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2402.68,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":199.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":223.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":230.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":231.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":241.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":243.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":248.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":256.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":260.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":266.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588651,"name":"Leocadia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leocadia is married, and she has four children She is running a kiosk that helps her to generate income for her family; she opened her kiosk a year ago with her own working capital of $600.

He is in a common-law relationship. Since he was little, he learned farm work alongside his family. Thanks to that experience, he now grows bananas and raises pigs for sale. This has allowed him to earn income to support his family daily. Every day, he tirelessly fights to overcome the obstacles present due to external factors. The winter causes flooding and at times, it has damaged crops. However, little by little, with patience, great care and dedication, he has managed to succeed motivated by his family. At the moment, the borrower is requesting a loan to invest in the purchase of farming supplies (fertilizers, seeds, pesticides). These products will allow him to continue caring for his crops and achieve a harvest with optimal conditions in order to sell his products at the market for a good price. With this work, he will be able to have a greater profit margin and he will be able to invest more in his business. He will be able to achieve his dream of having cultivated land on the four hectares he has available. Due to a lack of capital, he has not been able to achieve this. He will have adequate economic stability in order to give his children a good education, wellbeing and improve the quality of life for his entire family.

This has inspired him to request this loan to invest in the purchase of pigs and piglets to fatten and sell so that he will be able to have enough stock to fill the orders that are coming in and improve his profit margin and income. In this way, Julio hopes to be one step closer to realizing his greatest dream, which is to formalize his business and set up a meat shop that will be profitable and enduring.

","en":"Paola is 20-years-old and has worked in the distribution of beer for 4 years. She learned this skill from an uncle who has passed away. She works from home and places orders on Thursdays and dispatches to customers the next day. Additionally, she alternates this activity with their studies. Her aunt supports her by fulfilling her role at work when she needs to study. This way Paola has earned revenue to contribute to the expenses of her home. The business owner is a young lady who is energetic, enterprising, and vibrant. She is always searching for options that allow her to move forward. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor this reason she is requesting a loan in order to invest in the purchase of fixed assets (cooler) in the amount of $ 2,000,000 and an assortment of beer worth $ 1,200,000, for a total of 3,200,000 COD.

She works every weekend in the cemetery in her area. She sets up her stall hanging all her flowers in buckets with water and sells: carnations, sunflowers, gladiolus, lilies, irises, violets and roses in various colours. She works alone since her activity doesn't require great physical effort. She has been doing this work for 7 years already and it's going very well. She likes her job very much as she enjoys talking with other vendors while selling flowers to various people who come to visit their relatives' tombs and mausoleum. \r\n\r\nShe still does not feel fulfilled since she wishes to have a store dedicated only to the sale of flowers, since she feels that it is the moment to begin growing and to have her own premises. \r\n\r\nAt this time she is requesting 2000 Peruvian Soles.

She is directly concerned with the tailoring center. She takes order from the customers for stitching of ladies garments only. Due to her timely delivery and quality stitching, her reputation is increasing day by day. Being an educated woman she also helps her husband in managing the art and music school and computer and Xerox center. \r\n\r\nNalani\u2019s present dream is to give better education to her only son, so she is ceaselessly working for income generation. From the present loan she has planned to purchase raw materials like cloth, thread, and buttons, etc. for her tailoring center and accessories for the computer and Xerox center. She is confident that this investment must help her to increase her income. Nalani hopes to save enough money to establish the Art and Music school. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Prema, Aladini, Kuni and Ratnamani who are involved in vegetable vending, Badi\/papad making and selling, a betel nut shop and electrical & egg centre respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1393597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for computer accessories, cloth, thread, buttons, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-08-01T13:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-31T13:30:16Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nalani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aladini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ratnamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":66000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T16:41:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588210,"name":"Shyqyri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shyqyri is starting up a business; buying agricultural fresh produce from the villagers around and selling it to the local markets of a nearby main city.

She sells soft drinks and iced lollipops made with regional fruit such as custard apple, moriche palm fruit, green bananas, passion fruit, and pineapple. To make her wares, she has a fridge she bought with her savings, where she keeps all her products at low temperatures so as to always have refreshing and tasty items for the customers. In the morning, Sadith makes everything she needs, using good-quality fruit, and goes out in the afternoon with a cooler to sell her wares in parks or in front of schools in her vicinity. She started this business two years ago and has always worked alone. Fortunately, she manages to sell most of her production on the same day she makes it. She loves her business because she feels that her hard work is finally paying off. She considers herself successful, since sales and profits are good, and the business grows a bit more every day. In time, she hopes to have a shop of her own, where she could stay instead of having to go out to sell her wares. Sadith asks for a loan of 1,500 soles, and says she is deeply moved by the fact that there are people ready to help her make her business grow, which is why she vows to always be punctual in her repayments and to use the money responsibly. Thus, the whole sum will go toward buying the ingredients she needs to make her delicious drinks and lollipops, such as sugar and regional fruit."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":353.28,"image":{"id":1401643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients such as sugar and regional fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-01T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-31T13:40:04Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sadith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":233.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":237.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":236.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":255.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":265.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":271.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.51,"local_amount":233.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":238.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865079,"comment":null},{"amount":87.2,"local_amount":237.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":242.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353445,"comment":null},{"amount":86.88,"local_amount":236.92,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:22Z","rounded_local_amount":241.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905209,"comment":null},{"amount":93.69,"local_amount":255.54,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-10T10:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":260.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091204,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T09:54:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588323,"name":"Petrit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petrit is requesting a loan of 250,000 Albanian Lek in order to invest in dairy cows.

The family lives together in their own house. Alva makes a living producing clothes for men, women and children, having learned the trade at an education centre.  To start the business, Alva used her savings to buy a sewing machine.  It is now installed in her home, where her customers come to order each clothing item.  Alva has become accepted by regular customers, who recommend her services to other people.  Alva started this work two years ago and, up until now, she has been working alone.  Alva believes that her work is profitable because the money she earns allow her to support her husband with household costs.  Alva tells us that she sometimes finds the work physically tiring as she spends many hours seated.  In spite of this, though, she does not feel discouraged and continues working and putting in a lot of effort.
