She also sells charcoal for additional income.\r\n\r\nJulie would like to apply for a 50,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory.

He is grateful for the staunch support that Afodenic and Kiva have provided him."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1437134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel Ezequiel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608458,"name":"Sylvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sylvia is married with 3 children.

This is, in her own words, what she is doing to solve them: \n\u201cIn May this year (2013) I met with the founders of Nazava Water Filters. I am very impressed and appreciate all the efforts of them and the rest of the Nazava team to provide a way for people to get clean, cheap and healthy water to the people of Indonesia. \nI am interested in the background, philosophy and goal of their company, namely make the lives of especially poor people better, easier and healthier, therefore I dared to dive into promoting Nazava products. \nI see that Nazava Water Filters are a way out for the Indonesian people, especially those that live far from cities to be able to access safe drinking water in an affordable way so that in the end they will have a better and more productive life. \nBesides providing safe and clean water, Nazava also forms an opportunity for people to own an enterprise because Nazava provides opportunities to everyone to become a re-seller in Indonesia. As such they can eventually create new job opportunities as well. \nI already contracted 8 agents to work in the greater Jakarta Area, than because this is such an enormous urban region with over 14 million people, I will need to add some more.

According to the above-mentioned situation, Zviad lacks access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, as they require a stable income and business experience. The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled him to get a loan of $1,800. With the received loan, Zviad will purchase a minibus and start trading fruits and vegetables.

aged 32, is a married woman. She is a hardworking mother who is helping her family by providing tailoring services in her community. Her husband is a laborer who earns daily wages.She has been sewing cloths since her marriage because her husband's income is not enough to sustain the family.\r\nShe knows the techniques of tailoring very well. Her regular customers are mostly her neighbors, relatives and people in the local community. She earns enough to lead a decent life. \r\nRecently her sewing machine sustained water damage which broke some of the parts. She tried to fix the problem but it still is not in working order.\r\nTo help her continue her business, she has requested a loan to buy a new sewing machine and some packs of zippers and buttons to meet the increase in demand. \r\nIn addition to repaying the loan, she will use part of the revenues to pay for personal expenses.\r\nFozia is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner BRAC

la familia que era de nueve hermanos, es casado desde que tenia 22 a\u00f1os, es padre de familia de dos hijas de 27 y 37 a\u00f1os de edad, la mayor reside en los Estados Unidos desde hace cuatro a\u00f1os, se fue al ver las necesidades que tiene la familia y para darle una mejor calidad de vida a sus dos peque\u00f1os hijos quienes viven con don Roberto, la hija menor le ayuda a los oficios del hogar y trabaja un poco en la elaboraci\u00f3n de hamacas.\n\nLos padres de Roberto, le ense\u00f1aron el trabajo en la agricultura, los cultivos de mezcal y la crianza de ganado, sus dos peque\u00f1os nietos estudian en la comunidad  educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica. Actualmente se dedica a la siembra de ma\u00edz, frijoles, maicillo y la crianza de ganado. \n\n Compra los insumos agr\u00edcolas en la ciudad, para ello debe abordar dos buses y es un trayecto de 40 minutos hasta llegar al destino, el ganado lo compra en el tiangue que esta a 30 minutos de camino, y tiene que pagar el viaje para que le lleven el ganado a los potreros.\n\nSu hija, su esposa y los nietos siempre le est\u00e1n ayudando en el cuido del ganado, mientras \u00e9l esta en los cultivos.\n\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando es, para la compra dos vacas de $600.00 cada una,  las que comprara en el tiangue. El resto de dinero lo necesita para el arreglo de potreros, pues necesita cercar los terrenos, pues ahorita se le sale el ganado por que tiene el cerco de alambre en mal estado.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito vendr\u00e1 a beneficiar en gran medida al cliente, pues necesita incrementar el numero de ganado, para tener leche y sacar los derivados para la alimentaci\u00f3n de la familia.

Espera seguir con la salud que tiene de momento, para ense\u00f1arle a sus nietos los trabajos del campo, pues sus hijas ya son mayores. Tambi\u00e9n, en el largo plazo desea repellar su vivienda con cemento y arena, pues su casa es de adobe y necesita algunas mejoras.\n","en":"Roberto is 65 years old.  During his childhood, he studied through the fourth grade but his parents told him that he had to work in order to help the family since there were nine children.  Roberto got married at the age of 22 and he is the father of two daughters, ages 27 and 37.  The older daughter has been living in the United States for the past four years so that she can provide for the needs of her family and offer a better quality of life to her two young children who live with Don Roberto.  The younger daughter takes care of the household duties and earns a little bit of income by making hammocks.  \r\n\r\nRoberto\u2019s parents taught him how to work on a farm, in particular growing agave and raising cattle.  His two young grandchildren attend school in the community.  At the moment, Roberto grows corn, beans, and sorghum, in addition to raising cattle.  He buys his farming supplies in the city.  In order to do this, he must board two buses and travel 40 minutes in order to reach his destination.  He buys cattle at the street market that is located 30 minutes from the highway.  Roberto must pay for transportation costs in order to get the cattle to his pasture.  His daughter, wife, and grandchildren help with taking care of the cattle while he is busy looking after the crops.  \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be used to buy two cows worth $600 USD each at the street market.  The rest of the money will be used for repairs around his farm since he needs to enclose his land.  At the moment, the cattle are able to leave the property since the existing wire fence is in bad condition.  The money will be of great benefit to Roberto since he needs to increase the number of cattle in his herd so that he can produce milk and other products to feed his family.  Once he is assured that his family is taken care of, Roberto can sell the cattle in the future in hopes of earning more income.  \r\n\r\nAmong Don Roberto\u2019s aspirations is to gradually increase his herd of cattle so that he can sell milk and other dairy products to the community since he has been in this trade from a young age.  He hopes to remain healthy so that he can teach his grandchildren how to farm since his daughters are already grown.  In the long term, he also wants to whitewash his house with cement and sand.  His house is made of adobe and in need of a few repairs.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1436505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy two cows and to pay for repairs around his farm.

from Sierra Leone! This is 50-year-old Jeneba from Lunsar. She is married with five children between the ages of 11 years and 22 years. Four of her children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nJeneba runs a retails business; she sells onions, cooking oil and cooking seasonings. She has been running this business for eight years. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. At present, her major problem is the slow purchasing power of customers.\r\n\r\nJeneba has requested a loan in order to buy more food commodities like cooking seasonings, rice and cooking oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her family. In the future, she plans to educate her children up to university. She thanks you for your

She also has three relatives at home. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Queen established her food stand business within a busy market area. She began her business because she did not go to school and she was trained in business. She works at the business 12 hours per day and seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation of goods.\r\n\r\nQueen requires a loan in order to purchase more palm oil, rice and cooking seasoning. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her standard of living and repay her loan. In the future, Queen plans to expand her business even more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":101.98,"image":{"id":1432225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married and has three children. Shavkat's family still lives in his parent's house, in a small village next to a large field. After finishing high school Shavkat was not able to attend college, due to his family's financial situation. Instead he learned how to be a farmer from his father. They pasture cattle on the field next to their house and this provides income for the family. After marriage Shavkat decided to continue his father's business and took over the responsibilities for everything, so that his father wouldn't have to work hard and could take care of his health. Thus, Shavkat is raising livestock for a living and wants to expand his business so that in the future he will have enough income for a comfortable life. Also he wants to be able to provide his children with everything necessary and give them a good education. Currently Shavkat plans to buy a few more cows for his herd so that he can make more money. For this reason Shavkat has turned to Arvand and is requesting a loan to purchase the animals. Shavkat is thankful in advance to Arvand for financial assistance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1433599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shavkat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":713.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":737.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":762.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":786.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-05T21:04:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608710,"name":"Teopista","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teopista lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She was widowed 27 years ago and she has five children, all grown and with their own families. Since her husband died, she has devoted her time to caring for her children and continuing with the planting which her husband lovingly did. He taught her about the planting seasons as well as the types of soil appropriate to plant in. Now she has some much-envied fields, since her secret is letting the soil rest so that it can produce better and nutritious food. She sells her harvest at the market in Pampas every weekend. When she has a lot of crops, she sells to the traders in the country's capital, from which food goes out to the rest of the cities. She also has cows and chickens, which help her to have more income. She says that every time she fattens the cows, she sells them to butchers who come to the town. Her chickens lay eggs that she sells to the people in her village. This is her third loan with Kiva, and she is happy, since she has been working with her association for many years. The members are good people who have a strong will to help each other.

He is married and has four children. He has a high school degree. Bakhtiyor's kids are still young, and his hardworking wife Mukadas takes care of them. The whole family lives in a small village. To make a living Bakhtiyor and his wife work for the farming co-op. Mukadas milks cows and Bakhtiyor is a farmer. To supplement his salary Bakhtiyor also grows crops on his own 8 hectares\/20 acres of land. Bakhtiyor's house is in terrible shape and while Bakhtiyor has been planning to repair it for a while, it's hard to save the large sum necessary for it.

She started this business by selling cookies, and her aunty is the one who taught her how to sell.  She is requesting a loan to purchase more soft drinks for her business. She enjoys how she saves money every time, and in the future she wants to build a house. She thanks BRAC Liberia for their support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":108.1,"image":{"id":1432457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
