is Wilma, who is 42 years old and a resident of Cavite City, Philippines. She is married and the mother of three children.  Her husband is Menardo, who is an electrician.  Together with her husband and children, Wilma manages their household while operating a variety store. \r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one packet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Wilma makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 39,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nWilma hopes her business would grow into a mini-grocery, and she dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of theiir work every week.  It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1049709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy various grocery items to expand her inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T02:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T02:50:05Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5333,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5564.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303415,"comment":null},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":5334,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5566.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356140,"comment":null},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4266,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4451.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114240,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350294,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T14:06:02Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":447844,"name":"Sreul's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A married mother of seven children, Sreul is 62 years old and living in a rural village of the Dambae district in Cambodia.

Lkhagvasuren, who is 38 years old, has a freight transportation business with his old truck. For four years he has been in this business, and he has gained experience during this time. Now he lives with his wife and his two children in the ger district (ger is a Mongolian nomadic traditional yurt) in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nHe bought his plot of land in 2008 after his family moved in the city. Since then, he has been building his family's house. But it still is not finished yet, and there isn't enough money to cover the cost of the building materials for installing insulated windows, flooring and wall insulation. He needs cement, rock wool and foam to make them. He plans to have a well-insulated house which does not have any heat loss or emissions during the winter. In Mongolia, heat loss and emissions are big issues around the households in ger district. It is very harmful for your health and money. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in the winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons why Mongolia has hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas.  The loan Mr. Lkhagvasuren is taking will be used to buy insulation materials to build his new family home.

Because of the above problems she hopes and wishes to receive this loan amount to improve the family situation.

This loan use will serve the community in that it will assist so many people so that they will have goods available on short notice to the community as well as cosmetics products. The profits of this loan will be used to improve the standard of living within her family as better education, health care and nutrition will be offered to them.

However, she has always had the strength to keep going and continue making progress together with her children.  She and her ex-husband set up a stationery store ten years ago through which they made income for their household and covered their expenses.  However, five years ago her ex-husband left home.  Cielo was then left in charge of all the household expenses and so she had to improve her income in order to have enough money to provide her three children with a better quality of life.  She started selling hardware products as well as stationery products, taking advantage of the rise in construction work in her area.  Now, thanks to her hardware sales, she has managed to provide her children with access to a better quality education and her household has better financial opportunities for making progress.  Her biggest dream is to provide her children with access to a university education and so she is looking to increase her sales.  She is requesting a loan so that she can buy stationery and hardware products that she does not currently sell in her business so that she can offer her customers a wider range of products and increase her sales.  This will enable her to make better income for her household and her children will have the opportunity to enjoy a university education which will allow them to make progress in life.

She works on the sidewalks around the capital city.  She is 54 years old and the single mother of seven children who now live independently.  Only one of her daughters is still studying and lives with her.  Esperanza started out with little money then her partner gave her some, as did her children who had started working.  She bought more fruit and the profits were helpful.  She started to sell from home and in the streets.  She uses loans so that she can buy a greater variety of vegetables and fruit.  In addition, on weekends she sells a variety of fried food: enchiladas, tacos, burgers, roast meat and chicken.  This has been helping her to cover her expenses as she is a single mother now.

This activity will succeed because of the ever-growing demand  for wood to use as fuel in the urban town of Bamenda, high demand for poultry products and also pork from within and without Bamenda. Again the high influx of people into the city of Bamenda warrants many mouths to feed, thus the need also for more farming activity, the reason why she is also in farming. Moreover, the by-products of the fowls and pigs will be used as fertilizer in her farm thus reducing cost of buying fertilizer. This activity will help the community in that it will reduce the long distance mostly women go in search of fuel wood and increase the availability of protein products on residents'

She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEdna hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She is married to Ariel, her business partner, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a variety store business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.    \r\n                         \r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies in bulk at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMilagros hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work in her business.

","en":"Wilson, age 50, lives with his wife and two children, ages 3 and 17.  They live in the beautiful city of Cartagena, which is located on the shores of the Caribbean Sea.  It is one of Colombia\u2019s best-known tourist sites because it has one of the country\u2019s main naval bases and its historical-artistic heritage encompasses Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine military styles from both modern and contemporary ages as well as neo-classical and modern buildings.\r\n\r\nIt is in this fantastic place that he has his own modest telecommunications business.  He also sells beer, soft drinks, sweets, candies, and processed foods there.  He started his business two years ago when he started to sell cell phone services beneath the shade of a tree that is close to his house.\r\nHe does all of this in order to generate income to support his family.  Little by little his business has been growing.  As a good observer, he identified a great potential from passers-by who could be part of his clientele.  In time he achieved that, and he added candy, food, and drinks for his customers.  He earned money from them, saved, and moved to his house.  He set up two tables with display cases.  He took advantage of the family refrigerator and added soda and drinks.\r\n\r\nHe is now very enthusiastic about this change. He saved with discipline, and he bought a cooler because the family refrigerator could not keep up with his growth.  In addition to all of the previous products, he now sells dairy products, shoes, and various merchandise ordered by his customers.\r\n\r\nAs long as Wilson\u2019s business has been growing, he has not had enough working capital to respond to the market demand.  That is the reason that he turns to a Kiva loan, his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the loan to buy supplies, groceries, and a metal shelf in order to adapt his business to become a store.  In the store he will sells basic needs products that are consumed a lot by his potential clientele.\r\n\r\nHe will also fix the roof of the terrace of his house in order to protect his customers from the incessant Caribean sun and to lower the temperature of the place where he works.  This will provide a bit of shade for his business, which will improve everyone's well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1132868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","use":"to buy supplies, groceries, and a metal shelf, and to  adapt the roof of his terrace.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":147371},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":170721},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":174704},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":178781},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":182952},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":187221},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":191590},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":196060},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200635},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":205316},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":210107},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":215010},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":220027},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":225161},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":230414},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":263930}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":446235,"name":"Emiliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Emiliana de 35 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su esposo y sus 3 hijos en las edades de 2 a 9 a\u00f1os  en la ciudad de Cartagena, lugar ubicado a orillas del Mar Caribe,  uno de los sitios tur\u00edsticos mas hermosos de Colombia y muy reconocido, pues   tiene una de las principales bases navales del pa\u00eds y  por su patrimonio hist\u00f3rico-art\u00edstico, que abarca de vestigios de \u00e9poca cartaginesa, romana, bizantina, edificaciones de car\u00e1cter militar de \u00e9poca moderna y contempor\u00e1nea, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n edificios neocl\u00e1sicos y modernistas.

En la actualidad aspira a recuperar el mercado de v\u00edveres, que  representa para su negocio, mayores utilidades pero su capital de trabajo es insuficiente, para comprar en mayor volumen, ganar descuentos y hacer una oferta atractiva para sus clientes. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 arroz, aceite, legumbres, enlatados, embutidos, para venderlo en peque\u00f1os vol\u00famenes, en tanto a que sus clientes lo ofrezcan al detalle y todos  lograr ganar en la cadena de comercializaci\u00f3n.  ","en":"\r\nEmiliana, 35, lives with her husband and three children whose ages range from 2 to 9 years in the city of Cartagena, located on the shores of the Caribbean Sea, one of Colombia\u2019s best-known tourist sites because it has one of the country\u2019s main naval bases and its historical-artistic heritage encompasses Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine military styles from both modern and contemporary ages as well as neo-classical and modern buildings.\r\n\r\nThere in that fantastic place in a modest way she carries out her commercial activity since she owns a variety store where she sells cosmetics and perfumery.  When she started her business it was selling foodstuffs in various neighborhoods in Cartagena among shop owners and retailers.  Later on she stopped traveling to bring that kind of merchandise and started selling cosmetics, accessories and perfumery via catalogue which at present she sells on credit with weekly, monthly and bi-weekly payment plans according to her customers\u2019 ability to pay.\r\n\r\nMen are her main customers since she focuses on men\u2019s products which are quite profitable.  Her goal is to increase her family\u2019s quality of life which is why she strives to find products that upon sale produce the highest profits and a permanent capital turnover.\r\n\r\nShe is currently thinking about restarting the grocery business which will mean more business profits but her working capital is insufficient to start to buy in large volume to earn discounts and have attractive offers for her customers.  This is why she\u2019s turning to a Kiva loan, the first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy rice, oil, legumes, canned goods and cured meats to sell in small amounts to customers who will resell at retail all of them profiting from the sales chain.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1132878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T16:30:05Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emiliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92949},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":101107},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":103466},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":105881},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":108351},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":110879},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":113466},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":116114},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118823},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":128964}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.26,"local_amount":194056,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":195875.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395512,"comment":null},{"amount":58.79,"local_amount":103466,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":104435.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387301,"comment":null},{"amount":60.16,"local_amount":105881,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":106873.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994128,"comment":null},{"amount":61.56,"local_amount":108351,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":109366.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130488,"comment":null},{"amount":63,"local_amount":110879,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":111918.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519362,"comment":null},{"amount":64.47,"local_amount":113466,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:41Z","rounded_local_amount":114529.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071201,"comment":null},{"amount":82.7,"local_amount":145560,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":146924.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817591,"comment":null},{"amount":3.81,"local_amount":6704,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6766.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323892,"comment":null},{"amount":120.25,"local_amount":211637,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-28T09:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":213621.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062531,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-08T19:06:48Z","paid_date":"2013-12-28T09:45:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":448009,"name":"Marie Josee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie Josee is married with one child who is 22 years old.

All\u00ed en este fant\u00e1stico lugar y de manera modesta tiene su tienda de abarrotes, refrescos, bebidas, ranchos, v\u00edveres y enlatados.

Cuando Melida  decidi\u00f3 desarrollar su idea emprendedora e independiente, lo hizo despu\u00e9s de una experiencia que tuvo con su esposo, en una empresa donde vend\u00edan cueros y una vez quedaron desempleados, decidieron aprovechar el \u00fatil conocimiento de las estrategias de ventas, para emprender su propia aventura de negocio y generar sus propios empleos independientes. As\u00ed fue como empez\u00f3 la tienda, pues esta pareja,  deseaba gestionar ingresos suficientes, que beneficiaran a su familia,  primero vendiendo unos  pocos productos y adicionando cada vez mas otros nuevos,  hasta lograr diversificar  como hasta hoy lo han logrado, porque tambi\u00e9n ofrecen mercanc\u00eda a trav\u00e9s de gu\u00edas especializadas, especialmente productos de belleza. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es no tener un capital de trabajo suficiente, para implementar una estrategia mercadol\u00f3gica, que le permita impactar con precios, promociones y productos, que sus clientes piden constantemente y muchas veces su negocio no soporta esta rotaci\u00f3n, dejando insatisfechos a otros. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acuden a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1n v\u00edveres, abarrotes, c\u00e1rnicos, enlatados, l\u00e1cteos y productos de belleza que ofrece su revista con descuentos especiales. Con esta inversi\u00f3n planea aumentar sus ingresos, ofreciendo a buenos precios de productos, resultado del traslado de los precios de oportunidad con el que Melida accede al mercado al comprarle en mayor cantidad.","en":"Melida, 44, lives with her husband and four children whose ages range from 6 to 24 years in the city of Cartagena, located on the shores of the Caribbean Sea, one of Colombia\u2019s best-known tourist sites because it has one of the country\u2019s main naval bases and its historical-artistic heritage encompasses Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine military styles from both modern and contemporary ages as well as neo-classical and modern buildings.\r\n\r\nIn that fantastic place in a modest way she runs her grocery, soft-drinks, beverage, snacks, foodstuffs and canned goods store.  She also sells stationery supplies, cosmetics and women\u2019s accessories as well as other merchandise that sells well and complements the main products she retails increasing her income and helping her capital to turnover frequently.\r\n\r\nWhen Melida decided to develop her enterprising, independent idea she did it after an experience she had with her husband.  They lost the jobs they had at a leather processing firm and decided to apply the useful skills they had in sales to start their own business venture and generate their own independent employment.  This is how the store started out because this couple wanted to generate sufficient income to benefit their family.\r\n\r\nAt first they sold just a few products adding more new ones every time until they attained the diversity they now have because they also offer merchandise via catalogue especially beauty products.  Her greatest challenge is not having sufficient capital to implement a marketing strategy that will allow her to impress with her prices, special promotions and products her customers constantly request and often are unavailable in stock thus leaving some demand unmet.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why they are calling on a Kiva loan, the first financing they get from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo through which they will buy foodstuffs, groceries, meats, canned goods, dairy products and beauty products that are on special in her catalogue.

One is selling assorted merchandise like jeans and the other one produces extra income.  In the latter she makes items from wheat flour or frozen treats like turnovers and cheese pastries, among others.\r\n\r\nShe was studying to be a nursery school teacher but when she formed her family and was expecting her first child she had to drop out of the university and find a way to generate income which is how she became a merchant.  She availed herself of her mother-in-law\u2019s skills who taught her to make frozen treats in order to help support her new home\u2019s wellbeing.

His wife is a farmer. He has been a rice farmer for one year. He would like to get this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and support labor costs to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to make savings and expand his cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is a worker with ample experience in the fishing industry, as a member of the Association of  Women Seeders of Pianguas [a local shellfish] of Chira. And she has her own business selling fish and shrimp in the zone. The business has enabled Vilma to help her daughters study to become professionals. In addition, together with her companion, she has generated employment in a zone where it has been limited.  They have also managed to generate income to maintain their family and by this means, to help other families on the Island of Chira.\r\n\r\nWith experience in fishing, and by means of the local Piangua project, Vilma began her business. Over time, and using her earnings, Vilma has bought fishing equipment. On the present occasion, she wishes to replace her fishing nets. \r\n\r\nVilma's activity has a working period of 9 months out of the year, given the current restrictions (a prohibition against fishing, allowing the species to recuperate) in the Gulf of Nicoya. In the present situation, a grace period of 1 month is granted. She has 4 fishermen, plus her own boat, bringing in the fish and shrimp which she sells at the collection center in the Colorado de Abangares zone, where the chain of her business is completed.\r\n\r\nVilma's micro-enterprise works with a team that manages fishing around the Island of Chira. There are 4 marketers of their products at this single collection center where the shrimp and fish are received, and a competitive market price is obtained. There is no selling to intermediaries. Among their goals is to install a collection center on the island proper and thus, help more families obtain sustenance. It is recommended that assistance be provided for this activity, since the necessary conditions are available to generate employment, permitting many people on Chira Island to provide for their necessities and help the children in their studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1278.76,"image":{"id":1132948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to

In his free time, he enjoys playing soccer with his little ones and sometimes he cooks a delicious \"arroz con pollo\" (chicken and rice) that he shares with his family.\r\nOn his own initiative and thanks to the support he gets from his partner, Brando has worked as a motorcycle taxi driver for many years. He has a vehicle of his own, which he purchased with a lot of effort by saving money from previous jobs. Brando works approximately 10 hours a day and he's able to serve an average of 40 customers. He feels comfortable in his work and believes that his business does well because of his friendly, respectful manners.\r\nBrando is very thankful to Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he'll be able to do maintenance and renovations on his vehicle. He needs to fix the engine in his motorcycle taxi, since it consumes a lot of gasoline. That way Brando will have a vehicle in good condition and provide a better service. He'll increase his profits, which later on he'll use to purchase a car in order to work with it in providing taxi services. By doing that he wishes to achieve his biggest dream of being able to ensure his little children's future and well-being."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1132985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to do maintenance and renovations on his vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brando Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":85.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":92.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":97.53},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":104.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":111.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":113.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":118.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":123.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":446298,"name":"Julio Cesar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el municipio de Telica departamento de le\u00f3n, originario de una comarca aleda\u00f1a  El se\u00f1or Julio es Felizmente  Casado, de profesi\u00f3n Productor Agropecuario actividad que ejerce desde sus ancestros quienes lo ense\u00f1aron a trabajar de esa manera,  tiene 47 a\u00f1os de realizar dicha actividad, legado que le ha dejado a sus hijos con los que han ido trabajando a la par de \u00e9l y hoy algunos ya son independientes.\nDesde que inicio su negocio El se\u00f1or Julio lo que es la Agricultura en peque\u00f1as areas  se esforz\u00f3 por mejorar y emprender otra actividad como es la Crianza de Ganado tanto de leche como para el trabajo agr\u00edcola, siendo las ambas de gran fortaleza econ\u00f3mica tradicional desde sus padres y de esa manera mantener su familia la que es independiente por su propia cuenta y hoy vivir la vejez de manera satisfactoria y realizada con sus hijos formados con sus familias propias, adem\u00e1s tiene un area de bosques las que tiene de manera  organizada una de la necesidad es la compra de un toro semental para seguir completando la actividad pecuaria..\n","en":"Julio is originally from a neighboring region of the town of Telica, in Le\u00f3n department.

Felicidad currently has a business selling clothing.  She says that she started this business on the suggestion of a friend who used to be in the same line of work.\r\n\r\nFelicidad will use this loan to increase her capital.  She will buy clothing in the well-known street markets in the city of La Paz and then sell them as an itinerant street vendor (without a fixed sales location) in the city of El Alto.  This work allows her to make income to support her family.  She is a widow and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Felicidad replied that she likes the health services."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5500,"image":{"id":1133562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geovanna Rita\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Rosa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibeth Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicidad Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":38221.62,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3822.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3822.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3822.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3822.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3822.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3822.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3822.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3822.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3822.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3821.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":549.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":550.01,"local_amount":3822.2,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3828.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441332,"comment":null},{"amount":1100.01,"local_amount":7644.4,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7656.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495275,"comment":null},{"amount":1100.01,"local_amount":7644.4,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7656.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260819,"comment":null},{"amount":1650.01,"local_amount":11466.6,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":11484.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490529,"comment":null},{"amount":1099.96,"local_amount":7644.02,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7655.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095388,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-20T01:21:39Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":448270,"name":"Palerma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Palerma is married with four children.

He obtained improved productivity and quality in his crop, which increased his sales and, in turn, resulted in more income for the family. He used his second loan to purchase supplies and pay for labor in order to sow cucumber. However, he wants to invest in his business even more, since demand for his produce has increased. That's the reason why he currently requests his third Kiva loan, also to purchase supplies and pay for labor, so that he can sow tomatoes. He believes that this loan will be of help, because he'll be able to keep his business going and offer his customers high quality goods.

They live in the Mongkul Borey District of Battambang Province, Cambodia. She is a 37-year-old mother and is responsible for three kids who are all students. To manage her household, she grows paddy rice as the main source of income. Additionally, she also raises ducks and chickens. She has been with these businesses for more than 12 years, and she is able to earn about 21,000 KHR to support her family. Sary has taken out two previous loans with VisionFund, and she has completely repaid the loans already. The loans have enabled her to buy a new motorbike and fix her house.

She previously accessed a 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) loan that she used to purchase merchandise items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and in their personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for a 13,000 PHP loan to buy more merchandise items and products to increase her product inventory in her direct-selling business. The more items she has displayed and available on hand, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nVivian hopes her business will grow and expand soon. She dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance

She is a teacher at a secondary school and has been working for five years nonstop. \r\n\r\nHer rental apartment has too much heat loss and emissions in the winter. She uses the furnace, which uses coal, just to stay warm at home. Her son always has flu due to the cold. So she wanted to make repairs to her apartment. She is planning to insulate the windows and the wall corners. She will recover some broken and bad parts of the walls with cement and foam. It will reduce the heat loss, and she will pay less for coal. Using the coal is very harmful for her family's health and the environment, as she knows.  \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F), even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolian air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy the cars that run on the natural gas. The loan she is taking will be dedicated to buying some building and insulation materials for her home repair. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1658.32,"image":{"id":1136974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy some building and insulation materials for her home repair.

What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them with a little profit. Her products are children\u2019s clothes, shoes and other similar products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options that she offers. Ana Editha's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. Ana Editha will be utilizing the loan to buy RTW clothing and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAna Editha hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He started the business seven years ago when he became unemployed from a job with a company that processed dairy products and needed to make income to support his family.  He set up his workshop which has grown gradually.  Iroldo services motorcycles, light vehicles and heavy vehicles.  He makes both his sales and his purchases with cash but does not buy in large enough quantities to earn the discounts that are offered by his suppliers because he does not have enough working capital.  For this reason, he is requesting a Kiva loan (his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy putty, fiberglass, paint, resin, an oxygen tank and a polisher.  His Kiva loan will prove to be a successful investment as it will increase his working capital, improve his buying capacity, earn him discounts, and he will be able to respond more effectively to his

","en":"Adalgisa, 53 years old, is a married woman with three children who are between 25 and 35 years old. She lives with her family in Malambo, located on the west bank of the Magdalena River. This is one of five towns that form the metropolitan area of Barranquilla, a city about 20 minutes away. There, Adalgisa makes a living by selling various merchandise, especially cosmetic products, which she promotes through specialized guides. She is a member of a business that supplies her catalog to sell her items. Initially, she began helping her friends to sell and six years ago, when she had a good experience, she decided to generate her own family income by making a living through this commercial activity.\r\n\r\nSince she has been doing well for three years, she makes her orders directly to the magazine and does not need intermediaries because her business has grown. Adalgisa has had the opportunity to meet many people through her business, whom also request other products that she doesn't have in her catalog. Therefore, she buys them from independent service providers and has been able to establish good business relationships by buying clothes, bags, shoes, etc. In transactions, she asks for 50% of the total when she delivers the product and the balance is paid 15 days later. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is applying for a Kiva loan. She learned about this organization through a friend in town. This is her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan, she will buy bags, clothes, and women's accessories because she has advance orders made by her clients. She also wants to have sufficient working capital to complete these orders by discount shopping so she can offer a good price and have loyal customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1133686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy bags, clothes, and women's accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-12T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-11T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adalgisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":67220},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70655},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72304},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73991},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":75718},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77484},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79292},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.21,"local_amount":67220,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":69718.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395519,"comment":null},{"amount":41.22,"local_amount":70655,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":73281.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775303,"comment":null},{"amount":269.57,"local_amount":462125,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":479300.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364528009,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T10:46:17Z","paid_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":448468,"name":"Msakuzi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rofina, who is in her late 30s, is married with three children who are still going to school.

She has two children.  She is a widow; her husband died in 1996.  Since then, Gulchehra has been the head of household and has tried to provide plenitude for her family, so that her children would not feel the absence of their father.  She has been involved in selling women's clothing at a clothing market for over 11 years.  She has a wide selection of merchandise and a lot of customers.  Gulchehra has a strong interest in entrepreneurship.  She has been obtaining financing from our organization since 2003.  Thanks to the profits, she repaired her house and married off her daughter.  She never violated the politics of financing during the financing period.  Gulchehra is requesting this loan to increase her goods turnover.  She is grateful to our organization and relies on your support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1133165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-07-12T15:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-11T15:30:05Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulchehra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":13500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":571.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":589.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":607.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":626.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":645.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":665.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":686.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":707.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":729.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":752.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":775.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":799.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":823.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":849.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":875.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":902.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":930.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":959.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.47},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
