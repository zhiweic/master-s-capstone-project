For the past two years, Alice has been working hard to manage the rearing of cattle, whose milk she sells. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Alice has requested a loan of UGX 600,000 (Ugandan Shillings) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more cattle for milk and buckets to collect the milk in and will help Alice to generate greater profits and take care of her family members by providing all the basic needs. Alice hopes that, in the future, she will be able to own many cows that will produce much milk. \r\n\r\nAlice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Pool Service, located in Fresno, CA, is a sole proprietorship that performs general pool cleaning and repair services.  It was established in 2011 after Suren lost his jobs as a smog technician with a local shop, and driver for a medical transport company.  Suren realized that there was an opportunity in pool service due to Fresno\u2019s location in the heart of the Golden State where the winters are short and mild, and outdoor swimming temperatures are prevalent nine months out of the year.\r\n \r\nSuren is seeking $2,000 for working capital to purchase parts and supplies.  He gets a lot of repair jobs in winter and spring and the funds will help him with larger jobs that require him to buy parts up front.\r\n\r\nSuren is an entrepreneur at heart.  After losing both jobs in the recession, he started the pool cleaning and repair service business using his savings to acquire a pickup truck and tools.  Suren works hard to build his customer base and is proud that so many of his customers are referring their friends and family members to him.  He is unable to get a business loan from local banks.\r\n\r\nSuren and his wife came to America as refugees from Armenia in 2005.

is a 40-year-old, married man.

He has been involved in this business for 12 years. His business is located in a less-competitive area and his primary customers are local dwellers.

 is a married man. He has 5 children. He describes himself to be jovial, dedicated to his work and ambitious. He operates a 'posho' mill business where he mills maize into flour. He has been involved in this business for five years.

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is single with two children and one of them attends school. She does not look after any other family members.\n\nJoan has been operating a salon for six years, working six days a week. She does not have any other source of income.\n\nJoan has requested a loan of UGX 300,000 from MCDT-SACCO to enable her to stock more hair oils, artificial hair, and rollers, and to replace old towels. Her challenges include seasonality, transport, and the unstable electricity supply. Joan's dream is to own a big beauty and recreation center and to train one of her children to follow suit.  She joined MCDT because of the low interest charged on loans. Joan lives in a house that she does not rent, with access to electricity and no piped water.  Her major monthly expenses include rent for her business premises and school fees.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1279189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To buy more hair oils, artificial hair, and rollers, and to replace old towels.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2013-01-28T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-27T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":18700},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":19500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.8},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10.42,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":27788.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339575549,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":55577.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347119582,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":55577.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355865445,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":55577.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364659852,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":108000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":120048.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372972979,"comment":null},{"amount":7.09,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":18896.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381753788,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-28T21:18:53Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:56:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520644,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is widowed with four children.

Her office is really a community project, offering low-cost legal services and know-your-rights information seminars. \n\nMercedes envisioned her legal practice, located on busy Whittier Blvd., to be one to educate and empower the East Los Angeles community. In the last two years, Mercedes has helped hundreds of East Los Angeles residents to avoid deportation and separation from their families. She protected their rights in accordance with the law and helped others to confront domestic violence issues. \n\nMercedes has also envisioned uplifting community residents by mentoring some to explore pursuing legal professions and becoming advocates for their own community. She works with local non-profit organizations like the East Los Angeles Women\u2019s Center, Corazon del Pueblo, and neighboring schools and colleges by providing seminars and workshops.\n\nRealizing that the demand for her services is much higher than she had envisioned, Mercedes will expand her practice with the $10,000 KIVA loan and continue to offer pro bono educational services. She will use this loan to purchase computers, laptops and projectors to be used by volunteers and law students, and also to hire a legal assistant.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2813.61,"image":{"id":1283106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

is a wood-carver from Guatemala. Diego would like to stock up on raw materials for his hand-carved sculptures and masks and also buy an electric jigsaw. Diego has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I am a Maya woodcarver. At age 10, I left school to help my father work in the fields. Eventually, I began selling wooden masks, then learned to carve and paint them, while still helping my father. I am a devout Catholic, so I then began carving images of saints. Today, I have taught my art to six people, and I have been able to put my children, who are also wood carvers, through school.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful to you because you're helping me a lot.

Agreeing to repurchase her car and repair its front suspension per her husband\u2019s suggestion, Vangie was informed her vehicle was up for auction and she would have to bid for it. \r\n\r\nVangie returned with three vehicles from the auction, none of which were her original. She then hired a mechanic to repair them before selling them. The vehicles sold quicker than Vangie expected, so she then decided to continue purchasing vehicles from auctions, creating a new career for herself.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been 15 years since Vangie\u2019s first sale. She now carries 40 to 50 trucks, cars, SUVs, vans, blue title and salvaged-titled cars purchased from auctions at her buy-here-pay-here lot, A & V Auto Sales, located in her hometown of San Antonio.\r\n\r\nCompared to the multiple car lots in San Antonio and its surrounding cities, Vangie says her car lot is different because, \u201cWe try to work with everybody, and if they have problems with their cars after the purchase, we\u2019ll go the extra mile to fix it. If I have the parts, I\u2019ll give them to you, just pay for the labor.\u201d\r\n\r\nVangie has always been an entrepreneur. Her passion to sell began as a child selling various items at yard sales with her mom. As she grew older, Vangie made seasonal trips to Mexico to purchase wrought iron presents to sell in the U.S.A. and earn a small profit during the Christmas season.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Vangie employs two office workers, a salesman and a mechanic. She plans to hire at least one more mechanic in the near future.\r\n\r\nOnce a friend and former Accion Texas Inc. client suggested she inquire about a loan from Accion, she did. Since approved, Vangie says she is able to make ten more payments on her purchased cars. She is also able to purchase more cars before tax season, which is a high vehicle-selling season. She plans to use the rest of her loan for working capital. \r\n\r\nThough she has a successful business, being a used-car salesperson doesn\u2019t automatically guarantee an easy business path. Vangie understands how she has to switch gears when dealing with disgruntled clients. Within her 15 years of service, she says she\u2019s grateful to only have had two unsatisfied clients. \r\n\r\n\u201cI just want to try to sell good cars to people and not have these negative problems,\u201d she says. \u201cI try hard to sell a good car. It\u2019s not in my interest to sell a bad car; I\u2019m not like that. If I feel a car is in bad terms, I\u2019ll fix it. I get under the cars if I have to, and if I hit the wall, I\u2019ll give it to the mechanic.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1892.69,"image":{"id":1285197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

However, one of his difficulties is that his illness is PVVS (patient living with HIV\/AIDS).  The odor from the paint when stamping the shirts weakens him, since his illness causes his defenses to go down.

He wants to use the loan to buy shirts to stamp, paints, and stamping blocks.  \n\nHis words were:\n\"I hope to continue having God's help and blessing to be able to continue moving forward in spite of my health, and in this way have a formal workshop and give work to my friends and colleagues who are in the same situation as I am.

They are neighbors and friends from Olintepeque City, a 20-minute drive from Quetzaltenango in western Guatemala. Since the group was formed a few years ago, these ingenious women have expanded their businesses and increased their income, which has allowed them to support their families in ways they formerly thought impossible.  \r\n\r\nAs a new member of the group, Eva Maria, is starting her first loan cycle. She is 20 years old and a mother of two boys (a three year-old toddler and a five month-old baby). Both Eva Maria and her husband work to earn money for their family. Her husband is a toy merchant and Eva Maria raises pigs. She currently owns four pigs, but has plans to double that number with the loan she obtained from her involvement in the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank. The increased income will further Eva Maria\u2019s dream of going back to school. Her formal education was interrupted with the birth of her first son when she was in 8th grade, but she is excited about the non-formal education that Friendship Bridge provides with the loans. In the meantime, the money she earns will help ensure her own children complete school.\r\n\r\nAlong with Eva Maria, the ladies of Las Cumplidoras Trust Bank are engaged in various enterprises including sewing, the sale of chickens, fruit, food, and traditional clothing; and the management of a convenience store. On average these women have four children, each of whom they hope to provide a good education and continued good health. These important goals are now in reach because of the monthly training they receive from Friendship Bridge along with their loans. Lessons cover topics such as self-esteem, children's rights, business management, money management, budgeting, and savings.

She keeps several heads of livestock at home.  This is her main job; in their region raising livestock and growing crops is very realistic, and this is why she takes this business seriously in order to feed her family.  She has a big family and there is not enough work for everyone in the village, many travel to Russia to earn money, but Hafiza does not want to send her family to a foreign country and tries to feed them herself.  This is why she would like to get a loan from Arvand to buy several heads of livestock and to continue to grow her business.

Utkurbek\u2019s father taught him how to raise livestock, and this is the work Utkurbek has been engaged in from a young age. Utkurbek knows all the advantages of this business.\r\n\r\nHe has not renovated his house for a long time, and his living conditions are poor, which is why he would like to save up for house renovations. In order to do this, he plans to buy livestock and expand his business. Utkurbek hopes for financial support from Kiva and thanks you in advance. \r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1281353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy  cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-01-29T02:40:00Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-28T02:40:00Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Utkurbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":494.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":505.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":494.1,"local_amount":494.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":494.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751913,"comment":null},{"amount":505.9,"local_amount":505.9,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":505.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390615986,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-29T14:02:45Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":522302,"name":"Jinky","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jinky is a 41-year-old married woman from Bien Unido, Bohol.

He grows vegetables in greenhouses and also performs welding jobs. Last year he used his loan received from Kiva to buy plastic sheeting and seeds.  Fedor had a good harvest.  In addition, he received a lot of orders for welding jobs, which allowed him to make some additional income. At the end of the season Fedor did some calculations and saw that income from welding was higher, but income from his greenhouse - less than expected. \n\nThis year, Fedor is requesting a loan to repair his greenhouses, as well as to buy seeds and fuel for heating.  He plans to redesign a greenhouse (making it more frost-resistant), so that he will be able to harvest earlier and, as a result, to increase his income.\n\nThere has been a minor change in Fedor's family situation: his two daughters have entered first grade.

She also appeared as a good money manager and wise investor.\r\n\r\nSatymkan has been involved in animal husbandry since 1983, and this activity is the family's main source of income.  She started in this business with an initial capital of 500 rubles.  Thanks to her hard work, she now makes close to 17,000 som (KGS) per month, which is essentially used to cover the family's food expenses and daily living costs.\r\n\r\nSatymkan's farming business is doing well: she currently owns four cows, one heifer, 20 sheep and five lambs.\r\n\r\nIn order to further increase her business, Satymkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 45,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy some sheep.

His family supports his efforts to develop his farming business and, during the summer seasons, helps to grow peanuts and take care of the livestock. Each 5-6 month, Shukirali takes his cows to the market for sale, while sheep are ready every 2 months. In addition to tending livestock, Shukirali works as a construction site painter. However, his livestock business represents his main source of income, which is why he strives to expand it.

She invested the previous loans into selling of sweets. Even though she put a lot of effort to make her business grow and bring in regular profit the sweets frequently went bad because all of the goods were not sold in time. Because of that Katerina sustained some losses. This is why she decided to entirely change her business model and started to sell women's and children's clothing and by that has increased her income.\r\n\r\nThis time Katerina has come for a loan in the amount of 5,000 hryvnia to buy women's sweaters and children's jackets to sell during the winter season. Right now Katerina is not afraid of losses as before and hopes that she can invest more money into the continuous growth of her own business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":380.88,"image":{"id":1283724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

is 45 years old. She lives in the Senaki District with her husband and son. Ekaterine requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her family business start-up without success. Her loan requests were rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe source of the family's income is agricultural activities. In particular they have three milk cows and four calves, whose milk is used in cheese production. They also have a plot of agricultural land, where maize and 200 nut trees are grown. It hardly provides enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs in the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nEkaterine requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

He has worked since boyhood, earning money to support himself and his parent. Currently he works at a company that makes clothes. Yosef needs 6000 hrivnas for a driver's license. Yosef has never wanted to live off of his parents, and never expected that they would get him a car. He saved his own money and bught the car himself. Now he would like to get a driver's license but has to wait again until he gets enough money. So he has decided to take out a loan. Having a car will enable Yosef and his family to solve all kinds of transportation problems, since right away it will become a lot easier to get to the city from the village."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1283726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to get a driver's license","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Beregovo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.216667 22.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-01-29T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-28T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jozhef","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":763.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347095737,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":763.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355840089,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":763.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364548802,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":763.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372947059,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":763.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726608,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":763.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589739,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":763.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399834129,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":763.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410109559,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-01T14:12:59Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T14:27:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":522440,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of four children, Josephine works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business selling ready-to-wear clothing in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from pig fattening.

","en":"Sixta is the mother of 3 children, between 19 and 27 years old. Every day from Monday through Friday, she leaves her house at 7 in the morning and sets up in the doorway of an important business to offer its employees cheese sticks, empanadas, sandwiches, natural juices, arepas, and all kinds of food that her customers usually buy for breakfast. The idea for the business was born because her nephew had this business, but he found a regular job and offered it to Sixta. She took it over 4 years ago and so far it has gone well for her. Sixta stores her products in a plastic basket that she uses to transport them to sell to the workers with a short term credit of two weeks, when they get their paychecks. Other customers also pay her up front, but usually her strength is being able to sell on credit. Sixta also has another sales point where she works all week. It is located very close to her house and there she sells products made from wheat flour. Right now, she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy fruit, vegetables, and flour in larger quantities to increase her production for her customers, because her clientele has grown and she needs to offer more diverse products for consumption. Her goal is to have more working capital to be able to buy in larger quantities in order to obtain discounts. This is just what she will do with her Kiva loan. With it, she hopes to have more success with her profits because her dream is to put a second floor on her house and improve its facilities.

Tamaz is requesting a loan under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

He also managed to improve on the crop business, through the provision of local manure by the animals, for fertilizer. This has made it possible for him to maintain and ably support his family, in a manner that uplifts the household together with the community as a whole.\r\n\r\nJohn, therefore, gives credit to all those who are making it possible for him, especially the Credit Officers with whom he associates most.

She has a store in the city center, where she sells used clothing and fabrics to make costumes. \r\n\r\nShe opened her business two years ago, when she began to sell used clothing in Rio Frio, a small town in the department of Magdalena. Rio Frio is a spa town which welcomes many tourists visiting its beautiful cool river, where families meet to spend time together and enjoy themselves. \r\n\r\nLittle by little, Sonia began to make a name for herself and meet customers in the city of Barranquilla, located three hours away. She often traveled there, and this is how she came across the opportunity to set up a stall in the market. Everything grew from there. \r\n\r\nShe sells all kinds of used women's clothing, including jeans, blouses, vests, skirts and pants. She displays them on cords that hang in her store, and this attracts customers' attention because they associate them with a good price. She accepts cash for her goods and works from Mondays to Sundays. A friend of hers chooses and buys clothes from all over the city for her to sell in her store, and Sonia buys fresh stock three times a week. She also sells fabrics to make costumes. This is a successful business in the season leading up to Carnival, because the celebrations attract all types of buyers who want to make their own costumes.  \r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that she is requesting a loan from Kiva, to buy fabrics for costumes and used clothing, which will increase her selling potential and guarantee that her investment is

Cathy is 22 years old and lives in the town of Nyendo, in the Masaka region of Uganda. For the past two years, Cathy has been working hard to manage her small shop, which sells scrap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Cathy has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more scrap, which she will resell to manufacturing factories. The buyers will use the scrap to make new saucepans and plates. This loan will help Cathy to generate greater profits and take care of her family members by providing for all their basic needs. Cathy hopes that, in the future, she will be able to own a wholesale shop that sells food commodities. \r\n\r\nCathy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1285893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Eight years ago, he noticed that there was no place to purchase prepared food in his neighborhood; so he started to entertain the possibility of starting his own food business. And today, this is the activity that is his and his family's main source of income. He offers lunch and dinner, stuffed arepas (corn loaves) and other fast food, which he sells from 8 am to midnight.\r\nHe buys in bulk from wholesalers and delis, which allows him to get frequent discounts. This will be the first time he will receive a loan from the Fundacion Maria Santo Domingo and he plans to make it a success, as this will be a Kiva loan.

He is planning on modernizing his amenities, so he can be more organized and offer his clients more convenience.

Nurila's children are already grown-ups and live by themselves. The eldest son actively helps her in her business. Nurila has been working with livestock breeding for a period of 37 years, after having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nurila's hard work, her farm has three cows, 12 sheep, 10 goats and four mares. The income from the business activities allows Nurila to cover the daily expenses of the family. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Nurila turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of two heifers and one mare. Nurila plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals. Next year she plans to open a store for processing wool and create jobs for rural

school-aged children; almost all her children are adults and provided for, only 2 sons live with her and go to a lyceum school.  Bedeykan as a main source of income has been raising livestock since 1966, having started this business with 15,000 KGS.  Thanks to Bedeykan's hard work on her farm, today she has 3 cows and 8 horses.  In addition, she and her family work 5.99 hectares of land.  Her monthly income from the business is 5,000 KGS from farming and livestock.  In order to further grow her business Bedeykan turned to \"Bai-Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock.  The newly acquired livestock will help Bedeykan increase her profits, and after paying off her loan she will keep a cow as a net profit.  Bedeykan plans to invest the profits from the loan into further increasing her domestic livestock count in order to save money to remodel her home.

In 1993, in search of an income for the family, Kanybek started his business of livestock breeding. Thanks to Kanybek's persistence and perseverance, having started the business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS), the farm currently brings in around 10,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and meat products, and now counts two cows, 16 heads of goats, 6 heads of sheep and one stallion. The income from the business helped Kanybek to pay for the education of his eldest children. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further increase the number of cattle, Kanybek turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 68,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cattle.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Zippy replied that it will bring increased income from poultry sales.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Zipporah owns the following: 'cow, poultry, and automobile' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, or motorcycle'.
