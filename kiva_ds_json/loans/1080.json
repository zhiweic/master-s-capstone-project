She is a widow with three children. It's been five years since her husband died due to cardiac arrest.

She is thankful with God because through her patience and hard work, she is able to manage her businesses well.\r\n\r\nGemma's gained income goes toward their daily necessities, allowance of her youngest child and maintenance to her hog-raising and farming business.\r\n\r\nThis time, she struggles with a shortage of income due to an abrupt increase in their household and hog-raising expenditures. For this reason, she is requesting a loan of 11,000 PHP (Philippines pesos), which will allow her to buy additional kilograms of tilapia for her fish-selling business.

Although most surfers were men, Lola embraced being a female surfer.  As she began surfing more, she found that the typical surfboard just didn\u2019t meet the needs of a female surfer, and that the regular boards were bulky and difficult to manage.  She began to order custom-shaped boards that worked better for her body.\r\n\r\nLola quickly learned that she was not alone and that many other female surfers wanted a surfboard more proportional to their build.  Girls at the beach kept asking her how to get a board like hers\u2014sometimes literally buying the board out from under her arm.  Lola saw that many girls needed boards made just for them and had the idea for her business, Chick Sticks, a company specifically dedicated to providing surfboards and gear just for girls.  \r\n\r\nLola quit her job as a realtor and put all of her savings towards opening her shop.  Since then, she\u2019s expanded to a second factory location where her team of employees cut, shape, paint and glass the boards in-house.  \r\n\r\nWhat sets Chick Sticks apart is Lola\u2019s energy, creativity and commitment to empowering young girls. Before being painted, each board receives a special message of encouragement from Lola herself.  Lola also sponsors a surfing team of over 20 girls, providing boards and gear to many who would be unable to afford to compete.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, Lola will be able to purchase new stock and inventory so she can work ahead of the influx of orders she receives for custom boards.  Lola will also be able to embark on her new line of athletic wear for girls, which will provide them with surfing wear and gear designed specifically with their needs in mind.  With this new growth, Lola hopes to share her message of empowerment to girls who surf and skate alongside the best of the boys.

She started this activity because when her spouse was alive he worked as a cabinetmaker and she learned; when he died this became her means of family support.  She does her work currently buying pallets that she turns into chests of drawers with help from her brother-in-law.  The difficulty she faces is competition in the sector and crime in the city.  She\u2019s a widow with three children attending public school.  She wants to use the loan to buy glue, paint and pallets.  What she\u2019d like in the future is that her children can continue attending school and to have more work so that they will have everything they need."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":627.28,"image":{"id":1315706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

El  pr\u00e9stamo que solicita es por 15,000 Lempiras con el cual va comprar fertilizante y fungicidas para darle asistencia a su cultivo para mejorar la producci\u00f3n. Su plan es seguir ampliando el \u00e1rea de producci\u00f3n para poder ayudar a su hijo con la educaci\u00f3n y que este negocio sea su patrimonio.\n","en":"Mirna is 40 years of age, married, and lives in a rural village in Santa B\u00e1rbara. She has a 16-year-old son who is at school, and her husband carries out construction jobs in addition to farming.\r\n\r\nMirna is very hard-working, and has been producing coffee for 16 years. She sells the wet parchment coffee in her local market. She spends the time she needs on her business, and all her family works producing coffee, as the area in which they live is well-suited for this kind of farming. \r\n\r\nMirna has requested a loan of 15,000 Lempiras, which she plans to use to buy fertilizer and fungicides to help her farming and improve her harvest. She also plans to continue expanding her area of production, so that she can help her son with his studies and allow him to inherit her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":909545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fungicides and fertilizers for her coffee farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Pe\u00f1a Blanca,Cortes","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2013-03-19T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-18T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-19T18:59:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":539472,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is a vegetable vendor at the public market.

is 19 years old and lives in the town of Bungohko in the Mbale region of Uganda. For the past two years Sandra has been working hard to manage her retail store, where she sells sugar, flour, rice and others. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sandra has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to add capital to her business and buy more items such as sugar, flour, rice and others to sell, and will help Sandra to generate greater profits and save money to pay fees for her siblings. Sandra hopes that in the future she will be able to help the business to grow. \r\n\r\nSandra is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is Sofia. Her previous loan was a big help not just in her business but also in her family. She was able to buy more hogs and feeds thus generating  more income. Piggery is her business for five years now. She and her husband who is a farmer work hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 10,000 PHP loan for her to loan to buy additional hogs and feeds needed for her business. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nSofia hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams of having a good life.

is Jennifer. She previously got a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed for her business. Her earnings were a big help in her personal, household, and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for a 15,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better, as it will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJennifer hopes that her business will continue to be successful and dreams of having a good life.

Alexandra lives in Guayaquil.  Some time ago, she began learning to make party favors out of craft foam.  She found out that this type of business is very profitable from a minimal investment.  After a great deal of time, she planned to open a craft foam business.  Alexandra works by herself every day from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is not experiencing any difficulties.  Alexandra is not married, but she has two beautiful daughters who are studying at a state school.  She alone tries to help her daughters move forward and see that they lack nothing.  With this loan, she will buy lights, craft foam, paint, and other supplies.  Her dream for the future is to open a shop that sells children\u2019s party products so that she can have another source of income.  This will enable her to have better earnings and improved well-being.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":941.56,"image":{"id":1313902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy lights, craft foam, paints, and other supplies.

She starts her services daily from nine in the morning, and she works up until nine at night, depending on the customers\u2019 needs.  She especially works these hours during high sales seasons, and she sells for cash and on credit.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to increase her working capital in order to always have liquidity.  This will allow her to display the inventory that turns over the most, which she often does not have on her shelf.\r\n\r\nThis is the main reason for applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to use the loan to buy school supplies, shoes, and perfume.  Her investment will be successful because there is a constant demand in the educational market.  Also, her experience guides her towards achieving her sales goal.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1316508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy school supplies, shoes, and perfume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-03-19T22:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-18T22:30:10Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leomaldy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1170000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81062},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87503},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89545},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91635},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":93773},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95961},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98200},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100491},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":102836},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":105235},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":107691},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":116068}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.03,"local_amount":81062,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":81479.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527929,"comment":null},{"amount":48.62,"local_amount":87503,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":87953.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928671,"comment":null},{"amount":49.74,"local_amount":89545,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":90006.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705819,"comment":null},{"amount":50.91,"local_amount":91635,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":92106.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968108,"comment":null},{"amount":52.1,"local_amount":93773,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":94255.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817301,"comment":null},{"amount":53.31,"local_amount":95961,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96455.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323574,"comment":null},{"amount":54.56,"local_amount":98200,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":98705.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082808,"comment":null},{"amount":295.73,"local_amount":532321,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":535061.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062178,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-20T00:59:19Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:29:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533683,"name":"Mujeres Unidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 Mujeres Unidas se encuentra en el 1ciclo, donde todas trabajan en forma conjunta y solidaria dentro del programa.

That is why she has turned to a Kiva loan, which is her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy notebooks, pencils, folders, clay, books, etc. This way she plans to have more liquidity and the opportunity to make purchases at a discount, while selling at a competitive price. This will be very effective for her business to increase sales and generate better opportunities to save, so that she can live more comfortably."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1316515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy notebooks, pencils, folders, clay, books, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-03-19T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-18T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gisella ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":126648.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928672,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63324.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968109,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63324.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817302,"comment":null},{"amount":39.72,"local_amount":68083,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":71855.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323575,"comment":null},{"amount":35.14,"local_amount":60238,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":63575.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082809,"comment":null},{"amount":135.14,"local_amount":231679,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":244515.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062179,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-19T22:49:57Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:29:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":539826,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Marcelina  tiene 53 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada desde hace 30 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Luis de 64 a\u00f1os, con quien no tuvo ning\u00fan hijo, pero llegaron a adoptar cuatro hijos de los cuales dos ya se casaron y viven en forma independiente y otras dos est\u00e1n viviendo con ellos.\nLa Sra.

Avtandil sells the harvested nuts and the cheese locally, at good prices. But the family's income is hardly enough to provide food for the five-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRecently, Avtandil requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Credo approved his loan request, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

is Jowelyn, 26, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Jose, and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their family's everyday needs.\r\n\r\nJowelyn maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, supplements, and products such as lotions and house cleaning products, through suppliers like Marikina Shoe Exchange and Ever Green. A customer\u2019s order is bought in cash by the dealer, and then delivered to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers pay less for the products than the retail customers' prices listed in the catalog, and the difference is profit to the dealer on each sale. Jowelyn also sells processed and frozen foods, for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales, every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 17,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional products and merchandise, like clothing, footwear, and Ever Green supplements. She expects a boost in her business income, as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJowelyn hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams that her children will finish their studies and live happily.

is 29-year-old Santigie. He is married and has two children aged seven and five. He has no additional dependents. In 2006, Santigie established his drinks and provisions business. He began his business to improve his livelihood and the family. His business is located in the outskirts of town and his main customers are the general community. Working seven days a week and 17 hours a day, he earns about SLL 500,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of SLL 3,000,000.

","en":"Luzmila has two income-generating businesses: selling fruit and vegetables, and selling merchandise.  Both businesses support her household which is made up of her husband and her two children (5 and 11).  Luzmila arrived in the city of Barranquilla from her home town of Ceret\u00e9, in C\u00f3rdoba department, 12 years ago.  It was at this point that she started gaining experience in selling fruit and vegetables, alongside her husband.  Three years ago, she started selling tomatoes, onions, garlic and scallions, and fruit such as apples, oranges, mangos, papaya, melons, watermelons, lemons and every delicious, juicy fruit that grows on Colombian soil.   Her main purchasers are the stores and restaurants near her business and also in other communities where she has gradually gained new customers.  Luzmila and her husband work from Monday to Saturday, from 6.00am to 4.00pm.  Her current goal is to expand her stock but she doesn't have enough capital to do so.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy greater quantities of tomatoes, onions and seasonal fruit.  She will also respond to customer orders for beauty products which is how she complements her income.  She has a good customer base for these products.

They are all responsible parents and, between them, they have 20 children in their care.  They are all from Malpaisillo, in the north of the country, and are noted for being hard-working, responsible people who have a desire to improve themselves.  They work hard every day to provide their children with better living conditions.  Unfortunately, none of them was able to study owing to a lack of financial resources and each had to work from an early age instead.\r\n\r\nThe coordinator of the 'Vecinos Unidos' community bank is Magdalena, who runs a small pulper\u00eda (grocery store) which is located in her home.  A 'pulper\u00eda' is a small store which sells food products in small quantities such as coffee sachets, shampoo sachets, tomato ketchup sachets, matches, rice, beans, sugar, milk, bread, eggs, juice and soda.  Magdalena sells her products for 12 hours a day.  Her goal for this loan is to invest in working capital and stock her store so that, in the not-so-distant future, she can make better income.

He lives with his family in the Shakhrituz region, which is located in the southwestern part of Tajikistan's Khatlon region, and he works with his wife in an orchard farm (a small individual or collective private farm on which a few people work, mainly growing cotton, wheat or vegetables - crops which account for 60% of the irrigated land in Tajikistan).

The place where they meet is quite peaceful and they have all known each other very well for many years.  The group got its name because the area is characterized by its apple orchards.\r\n\r\nMarcelina, the group's representative, says that she's forty-six and has been married for twenty-two years to Armando, who works as a bricklayer.  They have three children, who are in various grades in school.  Marcelina earns her living raising and fattening up young sheep for later sale.  She buys the sheep as lambs and then raises and fattens them up for a few months.  Once they're big and fat she says she sells them to her neighbors, bbq pitmasters, or just to people who come to her house asking if she sells sheep.  In most of those cases, they probably want to buy a sheep to barbeque for a party or some other kind of celebration.\r\n\r\nThis time Marce is seeking a loan from the organization to buy more lambs; she's not exactly sure how many because she doesn't know what kind of prices she'll encounter.  She doesn't need to buy food because in her area they can pasture the sheep every afternoon.  She has been raising sheep for two years and says, \"I needed a way to help my husband with household expenses and the children's education, and raising sheep at my house has really benefited me because I could raise the sheep while looking after my children.\"  The only difficulty is when the sheep get sick and die, which means a loss of profits and investment.\r\n\r\nMarce says that when she started raising sheep she didn't know how to care for them and was very careless. One day she fed them tamales and corn, which are really fattening and hurt and killed the sheep.  She never neglected her sheep like that again.  Marce's goals motivate her to keep raising her sheep.  One of her objectives is to improve her home because it doesn't have a good kitchen.
