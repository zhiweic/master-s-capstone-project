She has secondary education. Since 2003, Gulzadakhan has been engaged in farming - raising livestock and growing crops, having started her business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulzadakhan's hard work, and to her husband's assistance, the business is currently doing very well. She keeps 2 dairy cows and 15 sheep, while also cultivating a plot of land where she grows potatoes and corn. Her profits have allowed Gulzadakhan to increase the size of her herd and to improve her family's well-being.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Gulzadakhan has turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional livestock. She plans to invest her profits from the loan into further expansion of her herd, while also boosting her family's financial

His mother looks after his two children at home. He wants to make an extension to his house as his children are getting bigger and bigger each passing day. He wants to create separate rooms for his children to study and sleep. So he is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, metal, cement, and bricks.

She runs a small scale agricultural business and owns a cow and two pigs. The family lives in poverty and receives a small monthly social assistance from the local government. As the living conditions are very poor, Natela and Malkhaz decided to start their business, but found that they didn\u2019t have enough money to do so.\n\nNatela\u2019s loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

He has a secondary education level because he chose to work at his brother's automobile sales business instead of attending the university. For five years, he has repaired and sold cars and accumulated a vast amount of experience in automobile related works. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and it needs some serious repair. So he is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass, and foam.

Along with teaching, she also owns  a small stationery stall in her home for her students. In her stall, she sells copies, lead pencils, drawing pencils, canvass, books, etc.\r\n\r\nDue to the increase in students, the demand for stationery also increased. Therefore, she requested a loan of Rs. 35,000 from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that she could buy more stationery for her students.\r\n\r\nShe also teaches her own children in her tuition centre, and she drives sufficient income from this practice at the end of the month.\r\n\r\nShe is very glad after taking this loan, and praises the lenders who take an active part in

His wife has been selling clothes and toys for children for five years. His parents have retired and receive state pensions. His mother and father, though retired, are still contributing to the family income by working as a cook and a carpenter, respectively. He used his previous loan on insulating the walls and roof, but the house still loses heat through its roof. He is applying for a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to buy and spray foam into the curb roof (a gambrel roof or mansard roof). As a result, the house will stop losing heat through the roof, and the family will burn less coal for heating, thus releasing fewer pollutants into the air and contributing to the efforts to combat air pollution.

She is very well-known in the area where she lives.  When she was 20 she began studying cosmetology until she graduated from the academy.  Then she started to work in a beauty salon, where she started as a helper.  She started by getting experience in cuts, styling, and doing the new hairstyles.  This made her excel and stand out with the customers.\r\n\r\nThen, as the years passed, she decided to have her own business.  She requested a loan to firm up this project.  She later got married and had two children.  She is now divorced, and the children have grown.  Her son is 12, and her daughter is 6.  They both go to school.  She has been able to raise them on her own with the beauty salon business.  She is a very responsible mother.\r\n\r\nShe will buy the products from a woman who sells cosmetology products like shampoo, rinses, hair dyes, and hair treatments.  Actually, she buys products from various companies.

This is because her daughter got sick, which cost her.  She was left with little money.  She did not have enough products, so she decided to request a loan to buy them and to have her products stocked for sale.\r\n\r\nThe need that will be satisfied is being able to buy products in order to have more income.  Also, when a customer requests a product, she will be able to sell it to the customer.  She will improve her quality of life with the daily income from her business.  This way she will be able to give her children an education and clothing.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to continue working with the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo as time passes in order to complete this loan and to be

Her partner is Jose, a seaman, and they have children. She manages their household while operating the business. She and her husband are working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTeodora operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales, every day.\r\n\r\nTeodora is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nTeodora hopes that her business will continue to grow and expand.

","en":"Emilia is from a town called Donanciano Ojeda where most of the residents still speak their native language, Otom\u00ed.  The main source of employment in this area is making crafts from \u2018ocoshal,\u2019 a raw material that comes from pine trees and that\u2019s formed into beautiful creations like napkin holders, jewel boxes, tortilla baskets, jugs, fruit bowls and many other crafts.  \r\n\r\nEmilia is in a group of people who are asking for a loan to improve their businesses.  The group is called \u201cPe\u00f1a Blanca\u201d (White Cliff).  She works making crafts and also has a peach and avocado orchard that\u2019s she\u2019s been working hard at for five years already.  She says that she\u2019s already had several harvests that she sells by the bucketful to the wholesale food market in Zit\u00e1cuaro thus earning more.  She also sells the peaches and right now she\u2019s asking for a loan to buy organic manure and insecticide to improve her trees.  She says that thanks to the loans she\u2019s gotten from the loan company she\u2019s been able to improve her orchard since she used to just own the land but didn\u2019t grow anything on it.  Thanks to training they gave her on how to improve her quality of life by means of the loans she started to work her land and improve her profits.\r\n\r\nShe had four children but only two who are attending primary school still live with her; the others are married.  The other group members are Catalina, Gerarda and Elodia.  They will invest in their businesses.  They will buy stock merchandise for the grocery store, will buy supplies to improve the avocado orchard and will buy supplies needed to make crafts.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2019.48,"image":{"id":1402372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-08-05T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-04T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elodia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4564.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4786.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5053.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5265.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5539.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5791}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":399.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":457.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":360.74,"local_amount":4564.48,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4568.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944866,"comment":null},{"amount":390.51,"local_amount":4941.12,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4945.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227940,"comment":null},{"amount":406.07,"local_amount":5137.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5142.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991785,"comment":null},{"amount":423.16,"local_amount":5354.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5358.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644436,"comment":null},{"amount":439,"local_amount":5554.7,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5559.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877901,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T11:27:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":589958,"name":"Tamara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tamara lives with her husband in Vanadzor which is in the Lory region.

Since there are no more children at home to attend to, she goes out and assists in harvesting ripe cacao pods at the farm.\n\nMarcus got inspired to plant cacao with the assistance given by a local association. He stated that fermentation\/drying has been a challenge for him and is happy that MMC cacao buying team is in place to purchase freshly harvested cacao beans. Marcus cultivates a variety of crops, which leaves him little time for cleaning his cacao farm. \n\nMarcus is requesting this loan to hire helpers to assist him in cleaning. Marcus stated that he is the only one taking care of the farm now, but he hopes that one of his children adopts the cacao-farming attitude, and then he will expand his farm with more cacao seedlings. \n \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":24.64,"image":{"id":1404579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean 500 mature cacao trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-08-05T17:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-04T17:00:12Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":8.34,"local_amount":16.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":16.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900690,"comment":null},{"amount":16.3,"local_amount":32.59,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":32.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088570,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-05T17:26:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592108,"name":"Pedro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pedro, age 33, is a certified organic cacao farmer with MMC.

They live in a Mazahua community and selected the group's name because the area where they live is called Rioyos. It has several neighborhoods. Some residents still speak the Mazahua language, and some women still wear the traditional, colorful Mazahua necklaces that make their garments so beautiful. The most notable festival honors St. Peter, the patron saint of Rioyos. \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel, 66, belongs to the group and has been married to Crecencia for many years. They have seven independent children. For 18 years, \u00c1ngel has owned a small grocery shop, a business he started because his father also owned a store. \u00c1ngel says that the income his father earned inspired him to open his own grocery store. As \u00c1ngel is older, he would have a hard time finding a job, but the store allows him to pay expenses. \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel has applied for a loan to buy items like bread, eggs, milk, sugar, salt, and detergent. \u00c1ngel calls his store \u201cLa Mesa del Rinc\u00f3n\u201d (Corner Table) because there has always been a wooden table in the same spot in the corner of his store. The only business problem \u00c1ngel faces is competition. However, he has many friends who are regular customers, so he doesn't worry much about competition.

activity here is fishing. The community is visited by people from the surrounding towns who come here to spend time with their families. They take advantage of the beaches and  enjoy the delicious mojarra fish that is found here. \r\n\r\nIn this community there is a group called Naranjo, made up of 7 people, each of whom has their own business that they use to try to give their families a better life; Ofelia sells clothes, Javier sells paper, Evelin sells soft drinks, Jose Luis sells ice cream and slushies, Gilberta sells clothes, Ismael sells groceries and Marco sells water and sorbets. \r\n\r\nDon Javier has been running his business for 9 years and he has his own paper supply store in the center of this community. He says that when he started his business, it was because there was nowhere to buy paper products in town and the students there had a hard time getting a hold of school materials. He also wanted to earn his own money so he could give his family a better life and to help pay for his children's schooling. \r\n\r\nHe is very happy that over the years his business has grown and his sales have increased. He is asking for a credit in order to invest in purchasing more products like erasers, pencils, mechanical pencils, crayons, paper, glue, notebooks, exercise books, pencil sharpeners and poster board so he can restock his business and be ready for back to school season, which is when he sells the most product. \r\n\r\nThe thing that don Javier likes the most about his business is that he gets to talk to people everyday and make friends with them, as well as being able to teach his children the importance of hard work because they help him in the afternoons in the store.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that in the future, his business will continue to grow and he will be able to give his children the opportunity to study for a professional career. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5625,"image":{"id":1402363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase erasers, pencils, mechanical pencils, crayons, paper, glue, notebooks, exercise books, pencil sharpeners, and poster board.

She has gained many customers, who prefer to purchase clothing from her. \r\n\r\nTo develop her business, several times, Armine has requested a loan from local financial institutions, but without any success.

She is the featured borrower member for Muhit A Shg Group. The group comprises twelve tribal women members who are financially independent and generate income for their respective families. All the group members reside in a village on the northern part of Manipur state, which is also one of the northeastern states in India. \r\n\r\nKipjang\u2019s husband is a teacher in a private school, and his earning is insufficient to manage the family\u2019s expenses. The income that her husband generates is mainly used for their kids\u2019 education. The rest of the expenses are borne by Kipjang, who raises cattle and weaves to supplement the family income.\r\n\r\nKipjang is raising cattle at her home, and she has one female cow with a calf at present. The cow and the calf are usually reared at the nearby fields for fresh grass to eat. The milk produced is sold every day to the neighbours, as the milk quantity is enough to sell. The income generated is usually used for daily expenses, which is why there are times when they don\u2019t have enough cash to purchase feed for the cattle. \r\n\r\nBesides raising cattle, Kipjang also weaves to make more income for the family. She usually purchases yarn and thread from the city market and weaves with them. Her woven finished products are women\u2019s wrap-around skirts, men\u2019s traditional shawls, and women's traditional shawls. The demands for woven products are high, as they are the main attire for the women in their tradition. Kipjang could not meet the demands of her customers. The unavailability of looms paralyzes her to produce more woven products, as she weaves with the traditional back-strap. She hardly manages three or four at the maximum in a month. \r\n\r\nShe wants a loan from Kiva and WSDS to purchase nutritional feed for the cattle and more yarn for weaving purposes. The nutritional feed is necessary, as the cow is also used in place of a machine for ploughing purposes, and the milk production needs to be adequate in quantity. She also wanted to purchase various yarn for weaving purposes to weave better and expensive woven products. That way, she will generate a better means of income and repay the loan amount in time. \r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful deeds and says she is delighted to work with them.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1400617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase various yarn and thread for weaving, and also to purchase a nutritional diet for her cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-05T19:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-04T19:50:01Z","loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kipjang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneikip","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamnuntheng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemjavah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veikhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Momring","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneihat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoirengkip","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T22:07:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":589998,"name":"Uk","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Uk is 63 years old and a widow.

To improve his family's finances, he wants to start a business raising sheep and combine it with his crop-raising work. Altiboy is planning on buying and fattening sheep for later resale. He has a shed in his yard for keeping the livestock and 300 bales of hay. He is requesting a loan in the amount of 1500 US dollars to buy 12 head of sheep. Altiboy figures that keeping sheep won't be much trouble for him; they  are grazing animals, and don't require special feed. They are easy to breed, handle the cold weather well, and are very hardy. Altiboy intends to utilize the profits from the business to repair his house and improve his family's standard of

","en":"Saibibi is a 56-year-old widow.  She, her son, daughter-in-law and grandson live in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  Her son works in home repair and her daughter-in-law makes the national women's dress. Saibibi is a homemaker.  Up until this time, she has not worked.  She now wants to open a grocery store.  She constructed a building next to her home for the store and bought a refrigerator, shelving, tables and part of her inventory.

She started her business with 10,000 KGS and now her monthly profit is 10,000 KGS.  She has developed her agricultural efforts and grows mostly beans.  She also works with livestock.  She has one dairy cow.  Her spouse helps her with the farm and also offers carpentry services.  With the goal of further business development, Anarkul has turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 20,000 KGS to buy ammonium nitrate to fertilize her land.

He supplements it with a monthly salary he earns from the government hospital where he acts as a senior medical officer.  He says he started agriculture because of the unsatisfying salary he earns, and he had to cater for his family's needs  and pay school fees for 4 of his children.  He hopes to use this school fees loan extended to him to put his son through the first year of college.\r\n\r\nThrough buying scholastic materials for his children, he says he has managed to educate his 5 children, the eldest having completed a degree in nursing. Thanks to Ugafode school fee loans, he has seen his kids reach where they are.  He says the 2 businesses have allowed him expand his home.  However he comments on a challenge of small capital that at times makes him fail to meet his set targets. He thanks Ugafode for being able to provide him with loans at an affordable interest rate.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":333.33,"image":{"id":1400820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"pay school fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-08-05T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-04T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aloysius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":172531.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480939,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":166666,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":172530.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880091,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667.01,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":172531.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983751,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166666.99,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":172531.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635850,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":166666.35,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":172530.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863292,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-06T15:15:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592152,"name":"So\u00f1adores (Flat) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"So\u00f1adores es el nombre de un grupo integrado por seis personas alegres y emprendedoras cada una de ellas desarrolla una actividad econ\u00f3mica: In\u00e9s venta de ganado, fermina venta de ropa y tamales, Glafira renta de tractor y cosechadora, Mar\u00eda del Roc\u00edo venta de refrescos y pollo, Blanca Nery venta de ropa, juventino servicio de taxi.

This is the first time that Angel has joined the Dalias group. He says that a friend of his mum saw that he was a reliable worker and knew that he wanted to invest in his business maintaining motorbikes, so she invited him to join. He says he learnt how to service and maintain motorbikes because a friend who had a workshop taught him how to do everything from when he was little. Apart from that, Angel has always liked motorbikes, so eight years ago he decided to start his own workshop since he got married and needed to support his family. Angel lives with his mum, who gave him a piece of land where he could set up his business. He says it is going well as he is putting a lot of effort into carrying out his repairs so that his customers will come back and recommend him. \r\n\r\nHe says that he is applying for a loan now to buy spare parts and tools that he needs for his motorcycles. He says that if he receives this loan his workshop will improve since a friend lends him tools but he wants to buy his own. He is grateful to those who have put their trust in him to give him this loan and he promises to make the most of it.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Minerva, Rosalba, Leopoldo, Norma, Martina and Ana Laura. They used their loans for different businesses including a grocery store (in which the photo is taken), the purchase of second hand clothes to resell, mattresses, sheets, covers, quilts from a catalogue and material to make handcrafted garments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6875,"image":{"id":1401857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy parts and tools to service the motorbikes he repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":6875,"lender_count":230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minerva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leopoldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Laura","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":87000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":6875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":7874.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8047.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8223.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8404.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8589.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8777.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8970.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9167.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9369.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":9575.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":635.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":649.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":664.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":678.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":693.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":724.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":740.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":756.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1955.43,"local_amount":24745.13,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T09:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":24764.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944874,"comment":null},{"amount":1345.39,"local_amount":17025.25,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":17038.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227949,"comment":null},{"amount":1405.16,"local_amount":17781.63,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":17795.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991794,"comment":null},{"amount":1467.59,"local_amount":18571.63,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":18585.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644443,"comment":null},{"amount":701.43,"local_amount":8876.36,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8883.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877905,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T19:18:55Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:27:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592155,"name":"Chalmita Ganaderia Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sara tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, es originaria de una comunidad ind\u00edgena la cual limita con el estado de M\u00e9xico, llamada el Lindero, ella es madre de un ni\u00f1o peque\u00f1o el cual pronto entrara a la escuela, dice que est\u00e1 emocionada por que su hijo ya ira al preescolar, dice que aunque son muchos los gastos entre material que pidi\u00f3 la escuela y el uniforme pero que vale la pena todo po que su hijo tenga estudios para que cuando sea grande tenga un buen trabajo ya que el trabajo del campo es pesado.

Although the costs are high between the materials that the school requests she purchase and the uniform required, she says that it is all worth it for her son to study so that when he is older he will have a good job because the work in the fields is very difficult. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to a group when requests loans to improve their businesses in order to be able to get income and improve their living conditions. Her group is called Chalmita because she and her group members are followers of the holy saint of Chalma. She has been making a living over sheep for two years and says that she began this business to support her husband with the household expenses and also so that she can have her own income. She says that her sales are best during the months of May, June and December. During May and June it is because the schools are closing so the parents are making food and having parties to celebrate their children leaving school, and in December it is because of Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year's celebrations. \r\n\r\nShe comments that her sales are going well and she is now requesting a loan to buy food for her the seven sheep that remain from her recent sales. She also wants to buy a ewe to continue raising more lambs. She also raises and sells turkeys which are easier to care for than sheep. She buys the sheep from others in her community and she sells them from her home. Her husband also sometimes brings the sheep and turkey to sell in a community called Zitacuaro where an open air market is held on Thursdays when they need money more urgently. \r\n\r\nShe is thankful to Visi\u00f3n Fund for the loan that is being given to her so that she can improve her business.

She is a native of an indigenous community called Macho de Agua, which adjoins the State of M\u00e9xico.  An office for Visi\u00f3n Mundial there helps low-income children to have a better quality of life.  Lidia has two children who are sponsored by Visi\u00f3n Mundial, and she says that thanks to this organization her children live in better conditions.  They are watchful of their nutrition, health and education so they can be productive members of their community and their country.  In addition, Lidia gets training on how to have a stable business.  She decided eight years ago to have a business raising and selling pigs.  Her husband made her a number of pens so she could keep her pigs in good conditions.  She says that she decided to sell pigs because in her community nobody was doing so.  And so she got excited about it.  In addition, the pigs are easy to feed.  She says that her husband helps her to sell them, as he takes them in a pick-up truck to a town where there are street markets every Thursday.  He sells them there.  She says that there are two months a year that she sells a bit more, which are June- because of the school closings- and December- because of the December Christmas celebrations and the New Year.  She also says that in her town, people come to her house to buy pigs.  She has three big pigs which are the ones that give offspring, so she keeps the big ones.  She also has a stud, which she doesn't sell.  Right now Lidia is asking for a loan to purchase animal feed and inoculations for the animals to keep them in the best possible condition. \r\nLidia belongs to a communal bank called \"Uni\u00f3n y Amistad\" (Union and Friendship) which has been working together for various cycles.  She says that they are doing well in their businesses.  The other members are Ofelia, Marisol, Fabi\u00e1n and Gilberta.

idea to organize a new business. Soramo had no source of income for many years. Since her husband's salary is small, they do not have the necessary means to provide for all four of their children. The children year after year since their birth require more and more benefits. She decided to organize a business that sells and buys food products. She has long been looking for help, and finally, she found out about \"Dobesya Ospecka\" organized by the Association of Business Women. She studied in a course and gained self confidence.

He was able to buy a piece of land that has allowed him plant more bananas for more output.Of recent he has managed to assemble some bricks which he hopes to use to put up a semi permanent house to improve his house hold living. He hopes to use the facility extended to him to mulch his plantation especially as it\u2019s been a dry spell and also buy more back cloth for trade.

She already has several years experience in fabric cutting and sewing.  \r\n\r\nShe is confident that she can start a business sewing women's clothing on her own.  She studied in the course called  \"Woman Entrepreneur, Get Ahead\" that is put on by the Association of Business Women, and she earned her completion certificate.

For the past three years Annie has been selling slippers in the local market, and now she faces no problems. She sells every day and spends 10 hours with her business. Annie started this business with a little income that she received from her husband, and learned this way of selling from her mother. She is requesting a loan to purchase more slippers for her business. Annie hopes to build her house. She thanks the lenders of BRAC Liberia.

Leticia helped scrub and clean at the popular bakery. While taking out the trash one day, she walked by another storefront and noticed that it was empty. \u201cThe shop looked trashed, the walls were collapsing,\u201d Leticia shared. As she looked at the empty storefront, she felt inspired to create healthy food alternatives for her family and community.

Leticia\u2019s church jumped in to help. A church member created the beautiful murals that customers can now enjoy in the store. Another scraped and painted the store. Her son and another friend dragged junk from the store and reconstructed it.\r\n\r\nLeticia\u2019s Kiva loan will help her purchase her initial inventory of healthy food. Customers can enjoy fruit salads, sandwiches and more nutritious meal options. Business is already growing.  She shares, \u201cBefore this it was just Taqueria after Taqueria! People come in and thank me for the healthy options.\u201d \r\n\r\n The current menu has been a success and Leticia will stick with what she knows. \u201cPeople are looking for ways to be healthier,\u201d she says.

His business is a retail store that offers high-quality hay, farm tools, lawn supplies, and gifts. He also sells animal feed and supplies. Part of the reason Kenny loves owning a small business is the one-on-one contact he gets with customers. \u201cI love working with people and love to see my client happy with what I offer\u201d, says Kenny. \r\n\r\nRecently, he has increased his business hours by opening on Sundays while his competitors are closed. He has also been running a publicity campaign to attract new clientele. He is most excited about his upcoming Saturday events which include free BBQ, a mechanical bull, and an all-day shopping pass which gives customers a 10% discount. \r\n \r\nIn the future, Kenny hopes to expand his business to cover the Northern part of Broward County, Parkland.

She lives with her husband Julio, with whom she has four children. They live in the house they bought thirteen years ago. From the early hours of the day she spends time tending to her plots of land. She says that thanks to her good income she has been able to buy more plots of land, where she sows large amounts of potatoes and corn. Her village is at the edge of the river and this helps her to improve her sown fields and to have high-quality harvests. Transportation is also easy for her because they are near the central motorway. Now her project is to get into raising animals. She says that she already has some cows and pigs, which she sells when she encounters any economic difficulties. Now she wants to improve her crops in order to obtain greater revenue and be able to invest more in farming.
