She lives with Agripino, her husband of 29 years. They have four children, all of whom are already married.\r\nCatalina and Agripino now live together in the home of Agripino's parents, located in the town of Sicaya. Catalina has been selling honey, yoghourt, and cheese for seven years in the capital city; these products are either unavailable there or cost a lot of money. Over time, Catalina has obtained good, loyal  customers who know her well. Catalina also sows potato, carrots, peas, and alfalfa on her extensive lands. She plants a lot, as this is her main source of income. She has 29 years of experience in agriculture. The secret to her success over all this time is based in distribution: her children help her by selling her produce in the capital city, where they sell for a higher price. Catalina now wants to improve her crops and to be able to save as much money as possible with her husband's help. She will be harvesting carrots and corn very soon. She belongs to the \"Sicaya\" communal bank, and this is her 17th loan with MFP. She is very happy, because during all this time she has been able to make a lot of money--all thanks to our economic support. She promises once more to repay her quotas. She enjoys being part of the association; all of the members are united and hard-working. Upon receiving your support, Catalina will invest in the purchase of natural fertilizers in order to improve her carrot and potato crops which she has already planted."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1036923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy natural fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-21T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-20T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455828,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-22T00:56:35Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403221,"name":"Olivia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olivia de 31 a\u00f1os convive con Santos, el padre de su hijo Samir de 8 a\u00f1os y del peque\u00f1o que viene en camino.

is Milagros, fifty-seven, resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Manuel and a mother to one child. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMilagros operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMilagros hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

She works making and selling tortillas.  She is 49 years old and married, and has seven children.  Her husband works in agriculture and in building.  They live in Colonia Bella Oriente in the town of Juticalpa.  Previously she lived in Barrio de Jes\u00fas, where she began making tortillas when she was a little girl when she lived with her mother.\n\nCurrently she works in the same business of making and selling tortillas, beginning at 5 a.m. until 5 p.m.  She has to travel from Colonia Bella Oriente to Barrio de Jes\u00fas, in the same city.  She also works selling Avon products.\n\nHer advantage is that she has very good customers.  Her disadvantage is that the stove where she makes tortillas is exposed to the sun and the water because she does not have a stand to cover it.  Also, she has to travel every day at dawn from her house to her workplace.\n\nLucia needs the loan she is requesting to invest in buying Maseca [a brand of instant corn masa flour] and firewood.  With the help of this loan she would change her standard of living because with the profits she makes she will be able to buy an industrial stove and make a stand to improve her workplace.\n\nOne of her goals is to have a well-established place for her tortilla business to better serve her customers.  She has had 14 loan cycles with FAMA and she has paid them back punctually.  With the profits from the loans given, she was able to build her little house.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1035095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy Maseca [a brand of corn flour] and firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-03-21T20:50:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-20T20:50:21Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seydi Dinora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2798.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016511,"comment":null},{"amount":272.58,"local_amount":5103.71,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-19T08:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5194.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277415776,"comment":null},{"amount":640.42,"local_amount":11990.79,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12203.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283476822,"comment":null},{"amount":115.12,"local_amount":2155.5,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2193.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850541,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T00:36:23Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403724,"name":"Ruben Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Rub\u00e9n  tiene 39 a\u00f1os y es soltero no tiene hijos, el tiene la actividad de  Coordinador - capacitador su oficina se encuentra en la zona central, este pr\u00e9stamo es la primera secuencia dentro de la instituci\u00f3n,  Rub\u00e9n utilizara  este pr\u00e9stamo  para la compra de mamparas para divisi\u00f3n de ambientes para aulas por actividad, la raz\u00f3n para solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo es para infraestructura de ambientes de capacitaci\u00f3n,  Rub\u00e9n enfrenta retos en su negocio que son mejorar sus instalaciones. y utilizara los beneficios para incrementar capital de trabajo.

While attending to her family needs, she also keeps herself busy with her business as her way of helping his husband in sustaining daily expenses.\r\n\r\nMary Grace owns a variety store. She buys groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk and sugar: primary commodities that are needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She is also into selling hollow blocks (the ones that are used in building houses) as an additional source of income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more grocery items and stock. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her earnings would be a big help for the education of her children and expenditures ahead.    \r\n\r\nMary Grace dreams that her children will be able to finish their studies and have a good life.  She hopes that her business will continue to grow and help them pay daily expenses. She is active in attending the weekly fellowship* as it makes her a better person and strengthens her faith in Christ.  \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMylene operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMylene dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1048210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-21T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-20T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mylene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5154.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998082,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2577.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606622,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4295.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095479,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":859.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359091,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-21T23:00:38Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":405435,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is fifty-six years old.

Eight years later, he has acquired valuable experience and a large customer base.\r\n\r\nHe is now seeking a loan to increase his working capital and bolster his revenue.

She lives in a close family in the Pelengana neighborhood of S\u00e9gou. She did not go to school for social reasons: she comes from a family that upholds ancestral values. \r\n\r\nRokayatou became interested in income-producing activities, especially selling clothes, as she learnt from her mother, who sold cotton clothes. After several years of apprenticeship, she began to work on her own by selling damask fabric, which is highly sought after. She has been doing this for two years and so she has experience, and she has many customers. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing her business capital and making more profit, she is asking for a loan. This is her first individual loan which she plans to use to buy to pieces of rich damask cloth. Rokayatou obtains her supplies in Bamako. She sells on a cash basis to a variety of different customers, she also exports to Senegal. With the loan, she expects to make a monthly profit of 400,000 CFA francs. This will allow her to repay the loan and take up other income-producing activities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1050157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy pieces of damask fabric.

Onaira has received 5 loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an institution she has been bound to for 5 years, and thanks to which she has succeeded in expanding her pharmacy by renting a place and she has placed there various cabinets and shelves. She is currently requesting a sixth loan, through Kiva, that she will use to buy medicaments and another cabinet. The success of this investment will mean she will have the change to increase her cash sales, and this in turn will help her offering more competitive prices. Her future goal is to buy her house, and she continues working in order to achieve her

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Emilson works growing coffee, he learned this business from his father.  The business of coffee growing in certain seasons is very profitable for Emilson because he has good clients that offer good prices for the coffee.  He requests a loan to buy fertilizer because he needs it to improve the plantation so he can have a good harvest.  The loan would help him in a big way because previously he had to commit the harvest through intermediaries who take advantage of paying the coffee at a lower price.  Some of the problems that Emilson faces are the shortage of labour to harvest coffee and the difficulties that he has to transport the product because harvest season happens in winter and the streets are in bad shape.  Emilson's biggest dream is to improve hi ranch infrastructure so he can increase his earnings and improve the economy of his home.

En Prosperidad Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Trust Bank Mujeres en Prosperidad (Women in Prosperity) was formed three years ago in Tecp\u00e1n Chimaltenango, a village in the central highlands of Guatemala near where the first capital of the country was founded. Currently, the Trust Bank has nine hard-working women who strive to move forward with their lives every day. The women engage in a variety of businesses, including selling: cosmetics, jewelry and gifts, typical and non-typical clothing, food, and curtains. \n\nMaria Coralia is a member and founder of the Mujeres en Prosperidad Trust Bank. She is 56 years old, married and has nine children, five of which still depend on her. Coralia, as she is known locally, is named in honor of a person who provided work to her father for several years. In the photo, Coralia is the third woman (from left to right), she is wearing a black blouse with purple flowers. \n\nCoralia has operated a food vendor business for the past 13 years. She sells small portions of typical Guatemalan food and operates her business from Monday to Saturday. She wakes up at 4:00 a.m. to prepare everything, and then she goes to the market from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. to sell her products. Her business has slowly grown over the years, and she has been able to help pay for her children's education. While most of her children only completed the sixth grade before they stopped going to school, Coralia is optimistic that at least her younger children will reach high school. \n\nCoralia is excited to receive a new loan, which she will use to start a new business. She is a very innovative woman and recently traveled to another city (three hours from home) for training in baking and decorations. She now wants to use her newfound knowledge to start a bakery. The loan that she receives will be used for two purposes: to invest in the existing business (food), and to buy some materials, such as a mixer, for baking. \n\n\"Access to loans for women is a great opportunity for growth; it makes us more independent and allows us to make our own decisions,\" said Coralia. \"My dream for my current business as for my new business is that in the future the two of them can be sustainable, so I further support my children's education.\" \n\nThe Mujeres en Prosperidad Trust Bank is very surprised that people from other countries have the desire to invest in them and are thankful that Kiva lenders reach out and trust them to use the loans wisely.

She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Tessie is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more grocery items to enable her to have more stocks. The more items are displayed at the store the better, as they help to attract more customers to buy in her variety store. More sales will result in better profit, which will help her to save more money for the expenses of her children in school. \r\n\r\nTessie hopes that her business will maintain an income that is sufficient for the needs of her family. She dreams that all her children will be able to finish their studies and be able to land a good and stable job someday. She wants to make available additional appliances that they need. She is active in attending the weekly fellowship* as it helps to learn a lot from the Bible. It strengthens her spiritual life.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She was born in \u0130stanbul.  She always took responsibility for her whole family, quickly becoming the family matriarch. She earns her living selling clothing, pajamas, towels, etc. in the city bazaar, which she has been doing for eight years. \r\n\r\nSaniye had many difficulties when she first started working, but now she has succeeded in streamlining her work and has now advanced so much that she takes her siblings to the bazaar and bought a car.  When she started, she did not have a place in any bazaar or a definite customer base. She just knew she had to work. She could not imagine that the situation she finds herself in now would come. \r\n\r\nTo build up her customer base, Saniye went door to door with a bag; she did not have capital so she would just buy three to five items to sell and contribute to the household. In time, she was able to find her own space at the city's bazaars; she sent her siblings to every one of those bazaars. At that point, she needed a vehicle because their biggest problem was carrying the goods they brought to the bazaar. She says she created things out of thin air through borrowing. \r\n\r\nSaniye always had problems getting inventory until she came into contact with Maya. Now she has been able to buy herself a car, achieving the most important step for her. Saniye still has expenses, such as her car payments and buying gas, but she is current with her payments.\r\n\r\nSaniye is requesting a loan from Maya, which she will use to buy clothing, pajamas, and towels.  She buys wholesale with the loan and is able to repay it before the due date. \r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff Volunteers,\r\n\r\nSaniye,  1976 \u0130stanbul do\u011fumlu.Ailesinin ortanca \u00e7ocu\u011fu olmas\u0131na ra\u011fmen b\u00fct\u00fcn bir ailenin sorumlulu\u011funu \u00fczerine alarak biranda ailenin reisi olmu\u015f.

She is 44 years old and married, and has two children aged 22 and 18 from this relationship.  Both of her children attend university and are still living with her.  Her husband is a taxi driver.\r\n\r\nShe studied beauty and personal care at an academy in the area.  She is a very good mother and wife, who works to help cover the household expenses.  She works painting nails, cutting hair and doing other personal care activities.  She does this work in her home or in her customers' home, depending on her customers' preference.

years old. In 1994, while looking for a source of income, she started her own business selling small personal and home accessories with an initial investment of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Elmira succeeded in developing her business so that it now earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Currently, the variety of goods on offer is limited, which is why Elmira has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS).

Today, her business, which she started with an initial investment of 60,000 som (KGS), earns roughly 15,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and meat products. Thanks to Gulbara's persistent work, her herd currently has 4 dairy cows and 15 sheep. In order to continue developing her business, Gulbara has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a credit of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional livestock.

She works every day from 8:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m., and sometimes until later if her customers need her services.  She also sells beauty products, for which she has some display cases.  She has been doing this work for more than 14 years and it is going very well for her.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy dyes, perms, and some work tools.

since arriving in the United States, Gustavo has had an entrepreneurial spirit and the work ethic to support it. When he arrived in the United States in 2007, he took his first job as a gardener's assistant, but strived to work for himself. He soon decided to open his own lawn care service under the name Gustavo Lawn Service. He used his own money to purchase a van and the equipment that it would take to support his business. As he began to acquire clients, he changed the name of his business to Black Pearl Enterprises and began to see even higher success. The heightened success allowed him to buy more equipment and begin to employ assistants. \r\n\r\nGustavo now serves 260 accounts in his Florida community and hopes to continue to grow his business. He has set up an organized schedule in which he serves his clients and has made room for immediate growth. He would like this loan to purchase more equipment to more efficiently run his business. At this point he sees this as his only set back to further

He enjoys his activity very much because he\u2019s always liked transporting his customers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Jos\u00e9 Luis needs to buy some tools and to pertinent service to his mototaxi and this is why he called on the Kiva program so that it can help him reach his objective.  Jos\u00e9 Luis is sure that his income will increase because his mototaxi will no longer be malfunctioning and if any malfunction should arise his tools will provide the necessary support.\r\n\r\nHe is a man who over the years has been exerting himself very much for what he has so he knows that he can still give much more of himself to reach his great dream: \u201cTo buy more mototaxis and have his own transportation firm.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1036854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

she also wants to buy some shelves in order to better display her wares.\r\n\r\nWith help from Kiva lenders she will be able to improve her income because with this new investment she will be better received by her customers which will contribute to her being able to reach her great dream: \u201cTo have a well-stocked store and to build her own house out of substantial materials.\u201d \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1042218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a refrigerator and shelving.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-03-22T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-21T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":101.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":106.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":108.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":114.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":117.12},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":121.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":126.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":130.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":135.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":140.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":145.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":151.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.54},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.03},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.85,"local_amount":101.35,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":103.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276602031,"comment":null},{"amount":316.59,"local_amount":825.88,"processed_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":844.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954078,"comment":null},{"amount":52.12,"local_amount":135.96,"processed_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":139.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088510,"comment":null},{"amount":53.76,"local_amount":140.25,"processed_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":143.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478117,"comment":null},{"amount":55.73,"local_amount":145.39,"processed_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":148.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347030821,"comment":null},{"amount":57.95,"local_amount":151.17,"processed_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":154.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775352,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T20:33:49Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T11:17:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":404375,"name":"Jhonatan Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jhonatan Alberto es un joven de apenas 20 a\u00f1os que con apoyo de su madre y gracias a su actitud ya es un microempresario, hasta hace unos meses el se encontraba estudiando enfermer\u00eda, pero debido a que su madre no contaba con los ingresos suficientes para poder ayudarlo a continuar estudiando, el decidi\u00f3 dedicarse a brindar el servicio de transporte en una moto taxi.\n\nActualmente el trabaja un promedio de 10 horas diarias, decidi\u00f3 dedicarse a este tipo de negocio porque sab\u00eda que en la zona en donde vive hay mucha demanda de este servicio y tambi\u00e9n las distancias de traslado son cortas.\n\nCon la ayuda de los prestatarios Kiva, desea poder pagar algunas cuotas para culminar sus estudios y tambi\u00e9n comprar parlantes para la moto taxi.

She manages a sewing business where she makes clothes, school uniforms, and decorations. She will invest this loan to purchase fabrics and accessories used in making a few of the products that she sells. Her profits will be reinvested in her business and a portion saved because she wants to expand her sales and open a clothing store.\r\n\r\nLuz lives with her husband in one of the poorest neighborhoods located in the north of Santo Domingo.

As the job did not require much leg movement he could spend more time sitting at work which is why he specialized in the manufacture and repair of shoes.

is Eric, 40. He is a resident of Silang Cavite, Philippines. He is married to Medeline, a housewife and mother to their three children. By the grace of God, Eric has managed to support his children's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEric operates a tricycle transportation business. He has one tricycle that carries up to five passengers to their destination within the community. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan for the maintenance of his tricycle and also to buy spare parts. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nEric dreams to be able to buy another tricycle soon. He also dreams that his children will finish their education. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week, and this is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1049483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay for spare parts and maintenance of his tricycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-23T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-22T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4295.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998089,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2147.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606629,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2863.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095486,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1431.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359098,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T04:01:17Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
