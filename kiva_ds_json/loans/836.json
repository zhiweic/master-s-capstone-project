In search of a source of income for her family, she became involved in selling food products in 2002 with an initial sum of 3,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Ainur's persistence and hard work, she was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS).  Today, the selection of products is limited, and this is why Ainur requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.

She is a widow with two children. She manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCemiliana operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 23,000 loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCemiliana dreams of growing her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

Three of them still live at home and two attend university.  The youngest is in school.  Her husband is a fisherman, but he\u2019s ill and not currently working. \r\n\r\nIn order to be able to earn some money on her own and help her husband with the household expenses, she sells all types of clothing door to door and also out of her home, where she has some display cases where she can offer her products.  She goes out to sell four days a week and on the weekends she sells from her stall where the tourists visit.  She sells for cash or offers credit to her best customers and collects every week.  She buys her merchandise in Guayaquil based on what she needs.  She\u2019s been doing this for three years and things are going well.  She started with the money from the first loan she got through the institution.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy clothing, especially children\u2019s uniforms and undergarments.  She\u2019s been a part of the communal bank for three years and she enjoys it because it provides loans.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her husband will get well and that he is able to return to his labors of the sea.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Cristina\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCristina hopes to grow her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Tursun is involved in animal husbandry, having started this business in 1996 with a sum of 25,000 som (KGS).

is a 29-year-old woman who is married with two children. She is a very kind and responsible woman. She raises fruits and vegetables in her garden and has been doing so for the last 3 years. She is a very experienced farmer and has deep knowledge of the land and how to operate it. A poor financial situation and unemployment have pushed her to start her business. \r\n\r\nXayala usually raises seasonal fruits and vegetables and sells them for a profitable price in the central bazaar. Fresh fruits and vegetables are very popular and are in high demand because people prefer to eat them every day and consider them very healthy. Also, one of the favorite national dishes is dolma, which is made of fresh eggplants, peppers, and tomatoes. Fresh juices are most likely made from fresh fruits. Xayala's monthly income from this business is 250 AZN. This is the only source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nNow Xayala would like to invest more capital into her business and purchase seeds and fertilizers. For this purpose, she has applied for a loan of 1000 AZN. This is the only source of income for her family and she hopes this loan will improve the lives of her family.

In order to further develop her business, Kamila requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy four bulls for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a future expansion of her business.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1075901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Oruktuu - Khutor village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-20T23:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-20T23:00:14Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T09:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329781,"comment":null},{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458634,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-21T08:34:40Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:24:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":414065,"name":"Saturnina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

In order to further develop her business, Salamat requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional heads of livestock.

is 62-year-old Ibrahim. He is married to a trader, and has three children, ages 35, 27 and 15 years old. He has two additional dependents. Five years ago, Ibrahim established his bread baking and provision shop. He started the business because he did not have the opportunity to go to school, so he decided to engage himself in doing business. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,200,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le3, 000,000.

","en":"Aliya is 47 years old. She is a widow and lives with her son. As a source of income for her family, in 2010 Aliya began raising livestock.

She works seven days a week. \r\n\r\nHarriet has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from MCDT SACCO to buy cream relaxers, treatments and braids.

In 2004, he established his provisions business. He began his business just after he completed his sixth form. He decided to go into business as a career and not to further his education as he saw it as a long-term investment and he needed the quickest way of earning money. Therefore, Alhaji Lamin decided to go into business with a small amount of income which he has expanded to this level.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan.

In August, Roxie began her franchise with RRS Holding Group and opened her New Orleans home-based business,\"Candy Bouquet\", which provides customers with custom-designed bouquets of candy. \r\n\r\nSince then, Roxie enrolled in college to learn better ways to market her product. Roxie still works part-time in a retail store and hopes to leave as her business develops. She chose the bouquet business because it is economical to begin and easy to get positive results, she says. At the moment, she employees one assistant but plans to hire three to five more employees in the near future. \r\n\r\nPrior to requesting an ACCION Texas Inc. loan, Roxie visited her local bank but was denied funding. She later found out about ACCION through a socio-economic development program. Roxie used the loan money for training classes, travel expenses and to purchase the candy bouquet starter kit. \u201cThe difference is these candies are made \u2026 out of Arkansas,\u201d Roxie says. \u201cAnd the chocolate is extra whipped. As far as baskets, they are custom-made and the stems are made by hand.

is Loida, 46, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLoida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and reselling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLoida dreams of growing her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1072635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-21T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-21T17:10:05Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Loida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6768.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095648,"comment":null},{"amount":98.96,"local_amount":4166,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359258,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3384.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303072,"comment":null},{"amount":98.95,"local_amount":4166,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355827,"comment":null},{"amount":39.59,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308113969,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-21T01:54:11Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":415686,"name":"Celestina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celestina is 48 years old and lives in Sta.

is Virginia, 58, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products of popular brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Virginia's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 5,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 43,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVirginia hopes to be more successful in her business and dreams of being able to give her children a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nBlandina operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, factories and others of the like. Aside from this she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 26,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nBlandina hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business; she also hopes that they serve the lord. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The members of this group are from the location of Tututepec which has a museum called Yuku Saa which in the Mixteco language means \u201chill of the bird.\u201d The town is better known as Tutu.  It\u2019s on a high hill and when you arrive at the community you come upon a beautiful white sigh on the top of the hill that says \u201cViva Cristo Rey.\u201d   The sign was made by the people in the community thanking God for their location and their families.  There are many lemon, papaya and chili fields and there\u2019s a dam called \u201cPresa de R\u00edo Verde\u201d and an irrigation system.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Catalina, 29.  She\u2019s noted for being a cheerful, hardworking woman.  She has been selling hand-made tortillas for five years.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cata, as she\u2019s better known by her fellow group members, has two children she loves very much.  Her children are called Emmanuel who is nine and Josu\u00e9 who is five years old.  She feels very happy for all the support from the Fundaci\u00f3n so that she can continue in business since she\u2019s a single mother and has to work twice as hard to give her children a better life.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cata tells us that she used to work in a home cooking and doing laundry but thanks to support from the Fundaci\u00f3n she now has her small business and is able to offer her children a better life and spend more time with them.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cata asked for the loan to buy more corn, logs and lime powder to make tortillas.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cata tells us that she rises at three in the morning to wash her corn and go to the mill.  She returns from the mill, lights her griddle and makes breakfast for her children.  She takes them to school and when she returns starts making tortillas to sell.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cata is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping single mothers who want to improve themselves and the lives of their children.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nEustiquia-who sells Mexican fast-food snacks\r\nElizabeth- who sells Mexican fast-food snacks\r\nAid\u00e9-who sells groceries\r\nFloriberta- who sells Mexican fast-food snacks\r\nSandra-who sells clothes\r\nEverardo-who sells fruit and vegetables\r\nLuc\u00eda-who sells candy\r\nIrene-who sells chicken\r\n\r\nThey all thank the Fundaci\u00f3n for its support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":1063090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients to make tortillas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"tututepec,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-21T22:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-21T22:00:09Z","loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eustiquia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aide ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Floriberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":47000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":11750,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11825.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656840,"comment":null},{"amount":675,"local_amount":8812.5,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8869.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317515,"comment":null},{"amount":1125,"local_amount":14687.5,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":14781.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418900,"comment":null},{"amount":900,"local_amount":11750,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11825.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568476,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-26T04:38:20Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":415801,"name":"Isack","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isack is a resident of Nkubu area in Central Kenya and has 15 years in farming.

She says that things are going well for her since she has been able to obtain income for her household with the loan.\r\n\r\nShe began this economic activity since she also wants to contribute to the household earnings so that her family isn't lacking anything that's most necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat she would like is for this small economic activity to continue moving forward until it can support her children's' education so that they can also get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are:\r\n\r\nFlavia, who will invest the loan in the purchase and sale of pigs to sell by the kilo; and Soraida, who will invest it in the purchase and sale of jewelry."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1066584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy ranch chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soraida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6076.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656844,"comment":null},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6076.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317520,"comment":null},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6076.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418905,"comment":null},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6076.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568481,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T16:42:06Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":415825,"name":"Hanh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanh is requesting a new loan to buy more food to sell from her stall.

The members of this group are from a small town called Tetepelcingo where there are many banana plants and green trees.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving to the community there is a river called R\u00edo Grande where they go to bathe and wash their clothing. The river has very little water.\r\n\r\nIn the locality the majority of the people make a living making tapestries as it's one of the things they like the most and that their ancestors taught them.\r\n\r\nIn the locality of Tetepelcingo they have a celebration. On the 6th and 7th of May they celebrate the town's holiday. There are rides, little bulls, and castles. All the residents go out to the park to have fun and the kids have fun going on the rides.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Teresa who's thirty-four years old. Mrs. Teresa has made a living making tapestries and tablecloths for ten years.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that what she likes most about her business is giving her customers good service since they ask for tapestries for baptisms and girls' fifteenth birthdays.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tere, as the members of her group know her, tells us that it was her mom who taught her how to make tapestries and combine colors to look beautiful.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tere is happily married to Elpidio who's thirty-six years old and with whom she has four children: Julio David who's sixteen years old, Litzi who's eleven years old, Cristian who's eight years old, and Enrique who's six years old.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that at times she doesn't have thread with which to work and that it makes her sad as she so enjoys her work. She feels bad when she doesn't have the resources to do what she most likes which is to makes her tapestries and tablecloths.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tere tells us that she is very happy with her business and that it provides her with good earnings. In this way she can give a better life to her children.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more material to make tapestries like: white thread, silk thread, worsted thread.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she is very happy with the foundation for supporting her so that her business grows and that in this way she can improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nIn\u00e9s, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nArtemio, who makes a living selling chiles and seeds.\r\nMaricela, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nA\u00edda, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nReina, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nMaria Susana, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nRufina, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nDemetria, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nPetrona, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\n\r\nThey are thankful to the foundation for helping people from small towns who have an engrained desire to better themselves as their town is very small and poor, but in Tetepelcingo there are hardworking people and many children that need a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":1066725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy material to make tapestries and tablecloths.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"tetepelcingo,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Artemio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Demetria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":47000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":5875,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5912.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656845,"comment":null},{"amount":1350,"local_amount":17625,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":17738.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317522,"comment":null},{"amount":900,"local_amount":11750,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":11825.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418907,"comment":null},{"amount":900,"local_amount":11750,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11825.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568483,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T17:22:33Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":415848,"name":"Winnie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Winnie is a 30-year-old salon owner in Mombasa.

The group decided on this name because it's where group member Adela lives. She is a 71-year-old widow who lives at home by herself, although her children live close by. Adela tells us that for the past 15 years she has made a living raising animals, but at this time she is requesting the loan to stock her general store so she can buy all the products it has been lacking. She plans to purchase detergents, canned goods, milk, cheese, sugar, bread, beverages and other items. She has had her store for 13 years, and it is located in front of a cemetery. The challenges she faces is that there is a lot of competition in the surrounding area and that makes it difficult to earn good profits, but she does not give up because things always end up well. One of Adela's goals is to expand her store since it is very tight and isn't very appealing. Between laughs, Adela says \"My small store needs a good makeover so it become presentable.\" Adela and the rest of the group is very grateful for the loan authorized by Kiva partner FRAC because a lot of times they don't have enough to invest in their activities but they will benefit a lot from this loan and be able to buy what they need. Efren plans to invest in used car parts; Miguel plans to buy cows, corn and feed; and Fernando plans to purchase sheep."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7025,"image":{"id":1063614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase detergents, canned goods, milk, cheese, sugar, bread, beverages, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Fresno Nichi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T04:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":7025,"lender_count":195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Efren ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":92000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":7025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13567.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":14336.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":14900.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15688.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16362.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":17144}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1036.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1094.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1137.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1197.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1249.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1309.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2130.75,"local_amount":27904.46,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":27996.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317525,"comment":null},{"amount":1137.81,"local_amount":14900.82,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":14949.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418910,"comment":null},{"amount":1197.95,"local_amount":15688.51,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15740.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568486,"comment":null},{"amount":1249.4,"local_amount":16362.21,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-26T08:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":16416.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399800,"comment":null},{"amount":1309.09,"local_amount":17144,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":17200.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407537,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-22T00:10:14Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":415878,"name":"Nora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nora is 41 years old and married with three children.
