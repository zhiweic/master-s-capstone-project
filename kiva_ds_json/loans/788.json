She wants to get her animals to a good weight so that when she goes to sell them she will make as much as possible to help her husband with the household responsibilities and keep their family's finances in good shape.  This is her first loan with FUDECOSUR.  She hadn't taken out loans with state banks before, but FUDECOSUR offered her this loan with better facilities and a much lower interest rate.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":491.77,"image":{"id":1001553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to tend to her pigs and fatten them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Bello Oriente, Agua Buena, Coto Brus","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vannessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":50081.93,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50793.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276644095,"comment":null},{"amount":106.16,"local_amount":53078.56,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":53832.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294560931,"comment":null},{"amount":151.99,"local_amount":75993.52,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-18T09:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":77072.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315381616,"comment":null},{"amount":133.19,"local_amount":66594.64,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":67540.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331969633,"comment":null},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":6.52,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381937601,"comment":null},{"amount":0.26,"local_amount":132.38,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":134.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728535,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T00:24:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391291,"name":"Gresanta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gresanta is 29 years old and lives in the Philippines.

These products are used a lot by Peruvians, because many plants that are grown in Peru are used to make natural medicines.

Ana wants the Kiva lenders to help her so that she can buy products for schoolchildren such as maca root, which is an energy-imbuing food that is consumed by children, and other products.\r\n\r\nAna's

She has a business making crafts and handiwork she makes with her own hands: rag dolls, picture frames and other items for which she employs the use of \"country\" style, a technique she learned from her mother who has a business with these same characteristics. Her goal is to expand the structure of her business, making clothing and becoming a famous designer, but her greatest challenge is the lack of capital for achieving it since, with her growing clientele, money runs short for investing and increasing her earnings. \r\n\r\nThus she turns to her Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which she will purchase basic materials for her business. She expects the investment will be successful because she will buy in greater quantities and be able to respond to her expanded customer base more promptly. In her business she yields an average profitability of 49.6%, from which she plans her gradual growth in her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1001579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy basic materials in larger quantities, such as cloth, yarn, thread, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":72748},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78528},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80361},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82236},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84155},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86118},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88128},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90184},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92288},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94442},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96645},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104167}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":72748,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":74202.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039244,"comment":null},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":78528,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":80098.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651368,"comment":null},{"amount":45.92,"local_amount":80361,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":81968.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140981,"comment":null},{"amount":47,"local_amount":82236,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":83880.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100872,"comment":null},{"amount":48.08,"local_amount":84155,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":85838.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338496,"comment":null},{"amount":49.21,"local_amount":86118,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87840.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395060,"comment":null},{"amount":50.36,"local_amount":88128,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":89890.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774879,"comment":null},{"amount":104.27,"local_amount":182472,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":186121.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993745,"comment":null},{"amount":168.72,"local_amount":295254,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":301159.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381706013,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-14T03:41:11Z","paid_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389720,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelly tiene 40 a\u00f1os, dedicada con mucho amor a su esposo Marcelino de 54 a\u00f1os y sus 06 hijos, viven en su propia casa ubicada en la comunidad de Palmapampa.

Her family lives in the city of Khoost.  Mariya is retired, but she is very active and can't just sit around the house doing nothing.  Because of this, Mariya decided to earn extra money at home by making duvets to order.  Using material brought by her clients, Mariya provides them with high quality, well made duvets.

She lives in San Jacinto, land of vertical weaving, hammocks and other beautiful artisanal crafts made by hand mainly by the women of this region. That is why it isn't unusual that Yarnelis follows this tradition and applies it to her business, with which she generates income for her home. She sells artisanal crafts such as backpacks and hats, among others. She knows that every season, there is a star product, and since carnival is approaching, she is working on the exhibition of the famous San Jacinteros hats. However, her working capital is insufficient for responding to her supply plan. That is the reason that she has turned to a Kiva loan, the eighth loan she has taken out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy hats, which she will exhibit at her business, and which usually sell at a good price, obtaining good earnings. During the 10 years that she has been benefitting form loans from this organization, she has been able to increase her inventory, improve her locale, etc. Her goal for the future is to put sliding doors in her business to increase security and achieve a more comfortable environment that invites customers in to buy her products.

They live in their own home, located in the Pichari district.  Andrea is a very good client with a good credit history.  She has a business selling clothing and shoes in an itinerant manner.  She does this work along with her beloved husband.  They take their products throughout all of the valley, from their town to as far as Puerto Ene. For them, this work begins on Wednesdays when they go around to many towns, looking for a good quantity of customers in each town to whom they can sell their products.  Also, the people who already know them always buy their garments, because they offer them for sale at an affordable price.  Before doing this kind of work, Andrea used to sell vegetables, which was also profitable, but this business had the disadvantage that the products were very perishable.  This is why she switched to selling clothing.  In the future, she is thinking of renting a sales stall in the same town of Pichari, so that she would not have to travel from one place to another to sell her clothing, because this is very arduous work.  This is the second loan that she has taken with MFP, and so she promises once more to make all of her scheduled payments.  Andrea is happy and content with her communal bank, because everyone in the group is punctual with their payments.  With the 3,000 Peruvian soles she requests, she will buy more garments to sell.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1001624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more garments to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T22:20:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3022.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187679,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T23:40:48Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389768,"name":"Luz Radiante - Chupaca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"L.

She produces chairs, tables and cabinets made from bamboo. She is also engaged in a hog raising business and is presently raising 13 piglets and one sow. Cristina currently spends her income on her hogs and basic necessities. Cristina would like to increase her profit in order to develop her finished products and thereby offer them at a higher price.

She lives together with Aurelio, age 57, with whom she has six children. She provided her children with education and raised them with good manners and good habits. She lives in her own house where she is now working hard to provide security for her old age. Every day, Doli gets up very early and takes care of the household chores. Once she has everything fixed up at home, she goes out to the market and buys well-chosen and fresh ingredients which she will use to prepare food. She has been doing this work for six years. She sells her meals from her home, and many people come each day in search of a plate of delicious and well-served food the way she knows how to provide it. She enjoys having this work very much, because it allows her to have control over her time during the day, since she only sells at night. During her years of work, she has been able to attract customers thanks to her good service, always provided with a smile. Now she has good sales and thus a good income. She hopes to continue to grow and expand with more tables and chairs to provide more comfort to her customers. This will be her eighth loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, since it lets her feel more secure in moving ahead with her business. At the same time, she is committed once again to fulfilling her payment schedule, as in her previous loans. She is also very grateful to be working with the members of her communal bank, since all of them are very responsible and have a strong sense of solidarity. With the amount she is requesting, 3000 Peruvian soles, she will buy ingredients and supplies to continue with her work, in addition to improving her business with more tables and chairs. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1001633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients to prepare more food, as well as tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T23:20:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":438.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":478.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":496.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":551.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.61},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":164.31,"local_amount":438.17,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":441.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386477,"comment":null},{"amount":179.61,"local_amount":478.94,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":482.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099581,"comment":null},{"amount":186.29,"local_amount":496.79,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":500.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713721,"comment":null},{"amount":187.6,"local_amount":500.25,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":504.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202614,"comment":null},{"amount":407.19,"local_amount":1085.85,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1094.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098298,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T21:22:32Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389771,"name":"Macaes Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Macaes est\u00e1 conformado por tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ellas es Karen Auxiliadora de 25 a\u00f1os quien tiene una pulper\u00eda.

She lives with her mother Antonia caring for her in a rented house, located in the city of Huancayo. Her father died 6 years ago and since then she has cared for her mother. Despite her young age, she knew she had to cope with the difficulties with maturity.\r\n\r\nShe started working when she was very young. And so with pride thanks to this, now she is almost finished her business administration studies. She knows that she will manage the difficulties that life gives her, she knows that she will succeed.\r\n\r\nFive months ago her older sister died, who was in charge of the restaurant where she sells anticuchos (kebabs, typical food of Peru). Now she assumed this responsibility with optimism, although still finding herself sad about what happened. \r\n\r\nDuring the mornings, in order not to lose money, she rents the facility to a lady that sells juices, and in the afternoon she offers delicious dishes until night.

When Trinidad saw that the village had transportation difficulties, she decided to dedicate herself to transporting cattle and also to bringing essential goods for selling in her community. The cattle she took was slaughtered and soon sold. Meanwhile, she kept another group for breeding. In time, she was able to get a vehicle that makes transportation easier and saves time. Currently, Trinidad raises cattle, which has been going very well, and she also owns a small agricultural farm. In the future she wishes to keep on establishing more cacao crops.

She's a single mother of two children aged 19 and 8. Ever since she's been single, she has provided them with an education and has always devoted herself to fulfilling their needs in order to improve their living conditions. She lives in her parents' house and her biggest wish is to see her children become professionals. Every day Gissela goes out to visit her various friends, neighbors and relatives in order to sell some of the cosmetics and perfumes she offers. On some occasions, she waits for them at her home, but since she is a dynamic woman who doesn't like doing nothing, she prefers to go out in search of customers. She has been in this line of work for 10 years and she does it alone, because she has learned to get things done without help from anyone. During her years of work, she has learned a lot, such as how to approach customers and how to convince them to buy an article. She's very thankful to be doing well, because she's aware that it takes a lot of work in order to succeed in this business. She hopes to be able to continue working hard and to expand into a cosmetics store where she can get better profits. This will be her 8th loan with MFP and she's glad to know she will have financial support, since it will give her confidence to expand her business.

Lleva realizando estas actividades por 15 a\u00f1os y aunque al principio no le fue muy bien, ahora le va mucho mejor ya que tiene clientes que siempre lo buscan o recomiedan para trabajos de otras casas.

Now things are going much better since he has customers who always search him out and recommend him for jobs at other houses. He hopes to be able to continue working and later get more moto-taxis in order to rent them. This will be his 6th loan with MFP, and so he hopes for a small loan in order to meet his goals. Also he once again promises to comply with the terms of his agreement, like with the previous loans he\u2019s had.

He lives with Rita, who is employed. From this union they have three children of 20, 18 and 16 years of age, who he loves very much and who live in his own house. Ra\u00fal makes a living raising chickens. He rents a coup with capacity for 2000 chickens from a friend of his, from where he manages a constant production of chicken.\r\n\r\nHe has made a living in this activity for the last 6 years, with the support of his children in looking after the chickens from their birth until their sale. He likes his business as he can see how his family are united and his children collaborate, as well as counting on a constant demand of production. It is the main food set on the tables of the local families. Therefore, seeing how profitable his business is, he has plans to continue with his business, wishing to extend it and have his own coup.\r\n\r\nThis will be his 5th loan with MFP. He hopes to receive this support to be able to accomplish his plans. Apart from this, he mentions that he feels comfortable with his communal bank as he considers them to be a united and supportive group. With the requested amount of 1300 PEN he will add it to his capital and will invest in buying baby chicks as well as food and vaccines to start a new production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1001756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chicken, balanced food for poultry and vaccines for these.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T11:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T11:10:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":194.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":206.86},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":214.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":216.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":230.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":237.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.74},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.74,"local_amount":194.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":200.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386486,"comment":null},{"amount":79.56,"local_amount":206.86,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":213.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099595,"comment":null},{"amount":82.53,"local_amount":214.57,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":221.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713734,"comment":null},{"amount":83.1,"local_amount":216.06,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":223.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202628,"comment":null},{"amount":88.7,"local_amount":230.63,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":238.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098312,"comment":null},{"amount":91.37,"local_amount":237.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:14Z","rounded_local_amount":245.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401095,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T05:13:37Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391373,"name":"Leom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Leom is 41 years old and married with 2 single children.

Apart from being happy and friendly, she is separated from the father of her children. She lives together with her eight year old son, and is both mother and father to him, living in her own house. Jessica makes a living selling live chickens. For this she buys them from the poultry farmers who raise them and she takes them in cages to sell them by the river. She has to make short journeys by boat along the river, to reach the hamlets on the banks of the river, to sell them to the inhabitants of these places. \r\n\r\nShe has made a living in this business for the last eight years. She is well known by the inhabitants of the area who wait for her products, as she is the only one who comes. She likes her business as it allows her to receive an economic income as well as making journeys and visiting new places. As well as being profitable due to the price that she sells at in these areas. On the other hand, she doesn't like the fact that some of her chickens die on the journey which cause her some loss. But she is not discouraged by this and wishes to continue in her business and also extend it by taking other products with her, such as clothing to sell. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan with MFP. Therefore, she requests a small loan to be able to fulfil her objectives.

Her children are both currently in school.  Norma's business is selling vegetables in the town market in her area.  She is very well known because she always has a variety of fresh vegetables at a good price.  She is an incredible woman who works hard to provide her children with their daily bread.  Every day, she gets up very early in the morning to go and buy her vegetables from the central market in the country's capital city because there she has access to a large variety of fresh vegetables at very good prices.  Her dream is to provide her children with better living conditions than those she had.  She does not lose hope of seeing her children become professionals.  Norma is not unconcerned by her financial situation as things are becoming increasingly difficult and needs are increasing over time.  This has led her to take the decision to invest in her business so that she will have the ability to deal with greater demand.  This will allow her to keep her business active for longer, given that it is her main source of income.  Right now, Norma does not have the money she needs to make this investment.  For this reason, she has decided to request a loan from INTEGRAL to invest in buying a variety of vegetables wholesale (carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, chilis, chayotes, etc.)  This will allow her to attract more customers and thereby make more income with which to achieve her dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1002184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, chilis, chayotes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Dalila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":52.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.03,"local_amount":34.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":34.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241357,"comment":null},{"amount":37.03,"local_amount":37.03,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":37.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269966308,"comment":null},{"amount":38.38,"local_amount":38.38,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":38.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276573595,"comment":null},{"amount":37.59,"local_amount":37.59,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":37.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283319172,"comment":null},{"amount":41.75,"local_amount":41.75,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":41.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049468,"comment":null},{"amount":661.22,"local_amount":661.22,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":661.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521110,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T19:37:24Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391438,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 44-year-old married man.

Corina is very grateful to this institution as in the past it helped her out with another loan to buy items for her business. She hopes to get the same favorable results this time too.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1002169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy cookies, fritters, candy, drinks, sweet bread, coffee, sugar etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Corina Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":52.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":56.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":58.22},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":59.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241354,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T08:50:40Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:27:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390040,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nLa se\u00f1ora Maribel de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en casa de su propiedad junto con su sobrino y un nieto.

She prepares her crop fields daily during this planting season.  She says that she needs little to harvest corn for the merchants who come to her own land.\r\n\r\nDuring this campaign she had to rent plots of land with irrigation to nourish the food.  She receives help from her husband, who is a teacher in a school.  He works in the morning and in the afternoon helps his wife care for the livestock that feeds on the alfalfa that she herself grows.  In this way she sells the milk she produces to other people who know its quality.\r\n\r\nIn this time of working she has seen the fruits of her perseverance.  She has more cows, and two bulls with which she plows the land.  She is convinced that she will get better economic benefits from what she has proposed so later she will have a livestock stable.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the Mujeres Trabajadoras solidarity group and this is her ninth loan with MFP, for which she hopes for your collaboration so she can continue with her objectives.  On the other hand, she promises to make her payments punctually.  Also, it pleases her to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nIf she receives her support, she will invest the requested money in buying natural fertilizers to spread among her quinoa and alfalfa crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1001697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy natural fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1545.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446508,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-14T13:18:30Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389791,"name":"Flor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor, de 25 a\u00f1os es una joven ejemplar.

She is requesting her third loan so that she can buy bricks, cement and tiles in order to achieve her goal.

He currently lives in his own home which he worked very hard to build.  He lives with his wife and three children, and he is responsible for supporting the family.  Oscar lives in a small community called \"Mochumi\".  It is a rural place which is home to approximately 100 families and is located in Chiclayo province, in Lambayeque department.\r\n\r\nOscar's business is selling bicycle and motorcycle parts.  He makes his sales from a space that he has set up in his own home and he has been in his business for approximately three years.  Oscar tells us that the idea to set up this business came about during a conversation with his wife.  They have always been alert as to how they can get ahead and improve their children's education and food.  As Oscar lives in a rural area, the need for motorcycle parts is continuous.\r\n\r\nThe amount that Oscar invested in his business was not enough to deal with the demand that he is currently experiencing.

When she has time, mainly on the weekend, Jesusa heads to her farm to weed or fertilize her crops.\r\n\r\nJesusa has a young son and, for his sake, she hopes to achieve her goal which is to grow her crops in larger quantities because coffee sells very well during the months of March and April.  This will be the first time that Jesusa has received a loan from MFP.  For this reason, she pledges to be punctual in making her monthly repayments.

She lives in her own home with her husband Marcel, 55 years old, and their 6 children who support her and give her the strength to keep going.\r\nSixta rises early each day to prepare her family's breakfast and later sends them off to their respective fields to work, growing cocoa and coffee plants. Sometimes they have to do the maintenance work, such as fertilising or eliminating the weeds that invade the plantations. These days she does not have to do too much of the work because her children help her with it all. She tells us that she has been working on farms for 45 years and she has learned enough to be able to sew, harvest and produce cocoa and coffee plants.\r\nHer greatest wish is to acquire more land for growing so that her family will have a better standard of living. This will be her 7th loan with MFP: she is aware that she has to be punctual with her repayments so that she might have the chance to borrow again. She is a responsible and trustworthy member of her communal bank.

Right now, she lives in her parents' home together with her partner, 25-year-old Richman.  Jimena inherited a hectare of farmland from her parents so that she could grow some crops which is what she most enjoys doing.  Together with her partner, she managed to sow cacao plants.

Their difficulty lies in the fact that they cannot make progress in laying the foundations for their home because their harvests are seasonal.

She has three dairy cows that give her the milk she needs to make cheese: \"I make five molds of cheese and sell them quickly for five PEN each,\" she says.  And if she cannot stock up with them, she buys other molds for three PEN, to offer at almost double.\r\n\r\nShe has 14 sheep and three calves that she is raising now to sell later, after five or six months.  Normally she buys a sheep for 60 PEN and sells it for 240 after six months of penning it.  With regard to her bulls, she rents them out for 25 PEN a day for use as yokes.  In this way she generates income in different ways.  This way Victoria gets ahead and supports her home.  Now she plans to acquire more animals to improve her sales and supply her buyers.\r\n\r\nThis will be the eighth loan she will receive from MFP, so she promises to be punctual in making her monthly payments.  She belongs to Dos de Mayo Communal Bank, and she is happy to belong to the group because it is supportive work.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the money from the loan in the purchase of a dairy cow to make cheeses, because her business also is profitable and immediate.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1002359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1545.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451327,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-14T14:01:09Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390209,"name":"Hermelinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hermelinda tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad es una madre muy trabajadora y emprendedora a la vez, vive con su esposo y sus 02  hijos en su casa propia la cual ha sido construido en base a su arduo trabajo, su casa est\u00e1 ubicada en  el  Caser\u00edo \u201cViviano Espinoza\u201d del Distrito de Las Lomas perteneciente a  Provincia de Piura la cual esta a unas 3 horas aproximadamente de la ciudad de Chiclayo, su caser\u00edo esta en v\u00eda de desarrollo por lo que en la actualidad solo cuentan con el servicio de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica. \n\nLa actividad econ\u00f3mica a la que se dedica Hermelinda es a la venta al por menor de ropa de ni\u00f1os y adultos la cual la distribuye recorriendo de lunes a s\u00e1bado todos los caser\u00edo aleda\u00f1os al suyo, ya cuenta con algunos clientes fijos por lo que esta al tanto de sus pedidos que realizan de manera quincenal o mensual, adicionalmente aprovecha tambi\u00e9n para ofrecer un producto adicional que son los zapatos lo que ha cre\u00eddo que es el complemento de su negocio principal.\nSu esposo se dedica de manera diaria a dar servicio de transporte por lo que alquila un vehiculo que transporta a los pasajeros de pueblo en pueblo, as\u00ed trabajando ambos han decidido salir adelante en el negocio para mejorar sus condiciones de vida y dar mejor alimentaci\u00f3n y educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos.\n\nHermelinda cree que aun tiene clientes por captar y con sus metas bien establecidas desea invertir en la compra de variedades tanto de prendas de vestir como de zapatos por lo que esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito a edpyme Alternativa un monto de 2500 Nuevos Soles lo que ayudara a cumplir con sus objetivos.\n\nHermelinda es una mujer de buen car\u00e1cter y muy trabajadora, cuanta con muy buenas referencias por los vecinos de caserio.\n","en":"Hermelinda is 48 years old and a hard-working and entrepreneurial mother.

She lives with her son in her own house, which has been constructed on the base of her hard work. Her house is located in the small village of Pedregal in the district of Tambogrande, which belongs to the province of Piura, which is about 3 hours from the city of Chiclayo. Her village is in the process of development, and so now they only have electrical service.\r\n\r\nOdalys' business is the retail sale of clothing for children and adults, which she distributes by going through all the towns bordering on hers from Monday to Saturday. She already has some regular customers, so she is up to date with their orders, which they place every two weeks or monthly. In addition, she raises and later sells small livestock such as sheep and pigs, among others. She has been working at these businesses for about three years, and they have generated enough income that now she has her own house and her business is growing day by day.

She lives in a common law marriage with her husband, who is a farm worker. They have three daughters, of whom two are in primary school and one is in preschool. She sells tamales, atole (a hot corn-based beverage), and rice tacos. She is applying for a loan to buy meat, rice, oil, eggs, sausages, potatoes, onions, leaves to wrap tamales, corn, lard, chocolate, flour, cinnamon, sugar, and charcoal. She began this business two years ago. Her mother had a similar business and helped her cook. Her business is important because she has income to buy fruit or pay for some of the school expenses of her daughters. She feels proud when her customers tell her that her food is delicious. She goes out with her cart to offer her products to the merchants in the plaza. As a housewife, she is planning to hire a person to sell food and thus reach more sales locations. Her business has helped her family when her husband didn't have work, as they take from the business for food.  Her dreams and hopes are to set up a place that will offer more advantages to her business, to have a helper to go out to sell her products on the plaza with the merchants, and to help her children continue to go to school.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Real, \"Thank you for your loans.

They live together in their own home made of noble material.  Jacinto is a farmer.  Ever since he was very young, his parents taught him about planting and harvesting cacao, coca, and coffee.  Now that he has a family of his own, he dedicates himself to his crops, which he was able to obtain with a lot of hard work.  During harvest time, he counts on the help of day laborers who help pick fruit rapidly.  Later he takes them to sell at collection centers in Palmapampa, where they offer good prices for each kilogram.  However, the difficulty lies in combating the pests that afflict the crop.  He doesn\u2019t give up and continues on giving the best care to get the best production.  His greatest hope is to keep planting his crops and in this way, be able to offer his children a good education.  This will be his 4th loan with MFP.
