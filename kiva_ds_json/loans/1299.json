She has two sons and twin daughters, all of school age. Her husband works in construction. Gulsat has a secondary education. The primary source of income for the family is Gulsat's work in livestock and farming. She started this business nineteen years ago when she bought 7,000 KGS worth of cattle. Because of Gulsat's hard work, her farm now has a dairy cow, a calf, and a 1.60 hectare plot of land where she grows beans, potatoes, and corn. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Gulsat approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow for breeding. Gulsat will get milk from the cow she buys, so she is planning on getting additional income from selling milk. Gulsat plans to invest profits she makes from the loan into increasing her livestock and she plans to save enough money for her children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1509509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chonkara villlage","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-15T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T14:50:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulsat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-16T03:19:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657554,"name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Mar\u00eda de 59 a\u00f1os de edad, es una persona que  estudio hasta noveno grado y es  casada su esposo se dedica a la agricultura.

She hopes to finish her degree in Early Childhood Education and eventually open up a day care center. \r\n\r\nHelp this dedicated mother provide quality education and care for her son and other children in her community!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1490712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","use":"to buy educational materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"New York, New York","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2013-12-16T15:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T15:30:18Z","loan_amount":8025,"lender_count":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":8011,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":8025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":230.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":295.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":307.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":302.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":308.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":309.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":315.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":316.87},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":320.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":326.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":328.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":334.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":336.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":340.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":348.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":348.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":353.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":356.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":361.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":365.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":369.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":374.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":378.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":382.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":328.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":336.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.79},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375.07},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":383.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T20:13:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645989,"name":"Ekua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Although she has received no prior formal education, Ekua is an entrepreneur.

She began her business because she was not privileged to go school, and as an adult her older brother gave her some money to start selling cakes. After she got married, her husband asked her to begin selling household utensils because of the fire risk involved in baking cakes.  Working seven days a week and nine hours a day, she earns about Le 1,200,000 every month from this business.

Now she is a group leader of five; all of them are applying for a loan of 6,200,000 KHR. As the group leader, she will use her portion to pay for reaping fees. She hopes that her rice will gain good crop yields to make her family\u2019s income increase to build a better life.

She sells them for meat to the local butcher shops when they are grown. It takes 8-9 months for her to grow them for sale. She goes out in the morning let the goats graze in the fields and returns by noon. Then she cooks for her family.  She resumes taking care of her goats, feeding them at home. Her brother assists her in selling and maintaining these goats. In this way she is earning to control her cash flow, which however, is not sufficient to manage her daily activities.\r\n\t\r\nShe wants to enlarge her business, so she wants to purchase 10 more goats. In this way she can earn a good amount after all expenditures in her business. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 110,000 INR for her group, so that they can earn more and control their families' cash flow.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase ten more goat kids and fodder and vaccines for them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Chandikhole, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-01-15T19:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T19:10:07Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chinmayee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sachi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atapi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suryamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sashirekha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T16:44:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657449,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Marie, a 40-year-old woman who lives in West Point.

is the profiled member for the group; she is also the featured borrower member. She is pictured with her hand raised. Prolonged ailments took away both her parents years ago and left her with no means of income.  She is unmarried but joined the women folk who formed this group to support one another in their businesses and called themselves Andro Makha Leikai SHG. The name of the group is similar to the place where the members live. It is about 35 kms from the capital town of Imphal and also one of the capital states for northeast India.\r\n\r\nBrewing is Kunjeshori's main occupation to generate income. Brewing has been their customary practice for the community and luckily she learnt how to brew wine from relatives and neighbours. The brewed wines are generally used during festivals and community rituals as part of their customary practice. She also sells them to the village and nearby villagers for more income. She says she is not able to meet the demand because she does not have enough money to buy quality rice and yeast for brewing. She usually gets an advance payment from customers, brews the wine, and supplies it. The income generated is small and insufficient for business investment and savings. It has to be shared for daily expenses, her brother's job and other necessary expenses which leaves very little for purchasing rice and yeast for brewing wine.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the loan, she is hopeful that she will be able to brew a large quantity of wine. The brewing supplies like rice and yeast can be brought and kept in stock with the loan, in order to generate more income. She is glad that Kiva is supporting her and the group, acknowledges their hard work, and assists them financially. She says \u201cThank you so much, Kiva\u201d and she will always remain grateful and obliged.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, brewing and piggery.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more rice for brewing wine to sell and generate more income for the family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-15T19:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T19:10:07Z","loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibemcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binakumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juboti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loidang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wasmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khemashori","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nandimala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunjeshori","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Panjabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tondon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":170000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T02:07:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657466,"name":"Asma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asma is a 26-year-old widow and mother of one child.

Romila lives in a village which is about 30 kms from state capital of Manipur and also one of the North-Eastern states in India.\r\n\r\nRomila quit weaving and starting running a variety shop in the courtyard of her house, facing the roadside which connects the neighbourhoods. She sells all essential goods and daily-use items like edible oils, a variety of cereals, bar soaps, detergent powders, candles, kerosene, shampoo and locally made delicacies. Generating income by weaving was unreliable because one can only earn in accordance with the demand of the customer and capability of the weaver. Therefore she opened the shop to earn on a daily basis and generate a regular income.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva loan, she will purchase more supplies to sell. She will buy a sack of rice, wheat flour and other goods. She will also start selling fresh vegetables as that is the main demand for the neighbourhood. She says, \u201cThank you so much, Kiva\". She and the rest of the group members will always be grateful for the unconditional support and co-operation. The other group members are engaged in weaving.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more supplies for the variety shop, sell them, and generate regular income ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-15T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T19:30:07Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Romila Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tembi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naobi Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premlata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bimol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T15:34:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657484,"name":"Balqees","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Balqees is a 42-year-old vigorous married woman and the mother of five children.

She only got this far in school as her parents separated and, after this, she went to live with her father and grandmother. Mar\u00eda's grandmother later died and so she stayed with only her father. A year after her grandmother's death, her father also died, leaving Mar\u00eda on her own. She had to leave school and start work and earning her food. Mar\u00eda has a partner, who works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been working in agriculture for ten years. Her father always took her to work and taught her the trade. Today Mar\u00eda is grateful to her father for teaching her this work. She also has a small farm with chickens, pigs, and three calves. Mar\u00eda wakes up at 4am in order to prepare breakfast for her children who are going out to work. She then feeds her chickens and pigs in order to then take the cattle to the pasture, a 30 minute walk away. Mar\u00eda then goes to see her children, to see how they are getting on with the agriculture work, before returning home to look after the farm and family.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy cattle as they are a way to earn profits. Mar\u00eda has already collected the winter harvest. The pasture is in a good condition for the cattle to graze and so Mar\u00eda wants to take advantage of this.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's dream is to pay off her loan. She also dreams of buying a plot of land and building her own house as she does not own her current home. Mar\u00eda dreams of having a big chicken farm and five dairy cows.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-15T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T16:17:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646164,"name":"Ibrahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim is 45 years old.

He is married and loves his family very much.  He lives n a rural area.  Elbek is involved in his own business to support his family.  He is involved in farming and animal husbandry.  He has land, where he grows agricultural crops and uses it for pasture for livestock.  Elbek has been working with Arvand for a long time and is a responsible client.  Today, Elbek has 7 heads of livestock that he is raising.
