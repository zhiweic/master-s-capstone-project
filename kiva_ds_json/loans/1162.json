Her previous loan was a big help with her business. It was also a big help with her children's education as well as their household expenditures. As of now, she is more focused on selling fruits and vegetables. She and her husband both work hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 15,000 PHP loan for her to purchase more fruits and vegetables needed for her business. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nEufrocina hopes that her business will continue to grow and that all of her products will be sold. She dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her life and business and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1384108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to

She is married and has four wonderful children. They all live together in a large house. The children help their parents some. Lutfiniso has since childhood always worked to earn the money she needs. Even now, no longer a young woman, she is running her own business. The business is bringing her a steady income, which helps meet her needs. Lutfiniso sells consumer goods, as she has been for over 20 years. She buys various goods at a wholesale market and brings them to sell in her village. She has a small store there to sell the goods. Her husband also helps with the business. He used to work on a farm, but has decided to focus solely on helping his wife expand her business. The business brings them a good income, and if they expand their inventory, they can do even better. That is why Lutfiniso wants to buy more goods and expand the business.

","en":"Saidmurod is 48 years old, and lives in the J. Rumy district. He has a large family: he is married and has five children. Saidmurod, as the head of the family, wants to provide good living conditions for the family and provide his children with an education. To do this he is planning to start an income generating business - sheep husbandry. Sheep breeding is only weakly impacted by market swings because wool is always needed by consumers. Sheep cheese is also highly valued, as it is considered very healthy since it is not fatty and has many nutrients. Additionally lamb meat is considered a choice delicacy, and many restaurants showcase their lamb dishes. The first offspring of a ewe can be sold at 8-9 months, and the lamb gains weight fairly quickly. Saidmurod has a good place for keeping and breeding sheep. He plans to buy four, and after a month of feeding them, sell them at the local market for a profit. To reach that goal, Saidmurod is asking for a loan.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result for better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nClarita dreams that her business will continue to be successful and hopes to have their own house and lot. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

","en":"Aziz is a young 22 year-old man.  He is a very hardworking and kind young man.  He is married and has two children.  He lives in his parents' house.  Aziz loves his family and his parents very much and wants to help them with everything.  Aziz's parents live on their pensions, and this is why he is the only person in the family, who brings in a stable income.  He has his own business, which yields him a good income.  He is involved in buying and selling men's clothing.  He has been in this business for 8 years already.  He brings his merchandise from another country and sells it at a local clothing market.  He learned this business at a young age, when he worked with others at a market, helping sellers to sell their merchandise, and now has his own business.  Aziz's wife is a homemaker; she devotes all of her time to raise the children and take care of them.  Now Aziz wants to buy more merchandise for sale because the demand for his merchandise is increasing, especially according to seasons.  This is why he needs money, and he came to Arvand to obtain this loan to purchase men's clothing for sale.  He hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand for the support in advance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":610.46,"image":{"id":1383177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She lives in the small village of Abasha District with her husband and five children. Kristine requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have a pig and a milk cow, whose milk is made into cheese products. Besides that, they have a 1.3 hectare plot of agricultural land, where maize is grown. They sell piglets, cheese and harvested maize at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKristine requested a loan from Credo to start-up family business. Kristine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

A este hombre lo conocen en la comunidad por su sencillez y solidaridad con todos quienes le rodean. Elio vive con su esposa en el Cant\u00f3n de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. Los productos agr\u00edcolas m\u00e1s comercializados son granos como arveja, fr\u00e9jol, lenteja, haba y tambi\u00e9n varias frutas y verduras. La producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados abastece la distribuci\u00f3n interna y el excedente se env\u00eda a la Regi\u00f3n Costa en productos ya procesados. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nLa agricultura y ganader\u00eda ha sido la labor de Elio durante toda su vida, tiene algunas vacas a las cuales cuida y adem\u00e1s le producen leche para la posterior venta, actividad a la cual le dedica al menos cuatro horas cada d\u00eda. Su esposa siempre le ayudaba con esta actividad adem\u00e1s de los quehaceres del hogar, sin embargo un evento fortuito de hace poco ha dejado a su esposa enferma y sin poder realizar sus actividades normales, pues al sufrir una ca\u00edda su columna fue afectada y el dolor y malestar han permanecido desde ese d\u00eda, es por esto que Elio ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual podr\u00e1 hacer atender a Tomasa con un especialista que le ayude con este inconveniente y adem\u00e1s para cubrir los medicamentos que eso conlleve, y as\u00ed mejorar su calidad de vida, pues la enfermedad en s hogar le roba tiempo que en d\u00edas normales es muy productivo.

","en":"Elio is a 63-year-old adult who grew up in the countryside and when he completed elementary school started working in the fields with his family.  Later, he married Tomasa who is now 57-years-old when he was very young.  They had children who all live independently now each with their own respective families.\r\n\r\nThis man is very well-known in his community because of his unaffectedness and solidarity with all who surround him.  Elio lives with his wife in Salcedo Canton located in the east of Cotopaxi, one of Ecuador\u2019s mountain region\u2019s most important provinces.\r\n\r\nSalcedo has several tourist attractions like lagoons and bathing resorts where tourists can enjoy extreme sports.  However, the main activity that\u2019s carried out in this town is agriculture and to a lesser degree, cattle raising.  The most common agricultural products are grains like peas, broad beans, lentils and lima beans as well as several fruits and vegetables.  Milk production and its derivatives meet local demand and any excess is sent to the Costa Region as already processed products.  Raising animals is also very favorable because of the canton\u2019s climate.  Despite these productive activities, there are worrying rates of illiteracy and poverty due to unmet basic needs like sewer service which is only available in 25% of homes.\r\n\r\nAgriculture and animal husbandry have been Elio\u2019s life\u2019s work.  He owns some cows he cares for that produce milk for subsequent sale; he spends at least four hours per day in this activity.  His wife used to always help him with this activity and also did the household chores.  However, an unfortunate recent event left his wife ill and unable to do her normal activities because having fallen she suffered an injury to her spinal column and the pain and discomfort persist to this day.  Because of this, Elio has requested a loan to be able to take Tomasa to a specialist who can help her with this inconvenience and also to pay for any medicine that this may require thus improving her quality of life because illness at home robs them of time that under normal circumstances is very productive.\r\n\r\nElio is grateful for the openness and sensibility of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who provide him with the opportunity of obtaining this loan by means of Kiva lenders from whom he\u2019s sure to also get the required support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":417.22,"image":{"id":1384636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","use":"to pay for his wife's medical treatments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salcedo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-08T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-07T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":684.59,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":60.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":67.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":70.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":72.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.1,"local_amount":60.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":62.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565425,"comment":null},{"amount":64.89,"local_amount":63.46,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":64.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814462,"comment":null},{"amount":66.28,"local_amount":64.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":66.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320635,"comment":null},{"amount":80.64,"local_amount":78.86,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":80.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856324,"comment":null},{"amount":72.06,"local_amount":70.47,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":72.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059900,"comment":null},{"amount":71.25,"local_amount":69.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":71.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995236,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T17:13:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":580883,"name":"Cipriana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

He lives in Akhmeta District with his wife. They run a small-scale agricultural business and grow different kinds of vegetables which are used by the family. The only source of income for the family is a small income earned by Aleksi, working locally as an auto mechanic. \r\n\r\nSeveral times, Aleksi requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nAleksi requested a loan from Credo to restart-up a trading business and to set up a store where auto parts and accessories will be sold. Aleksi was in this business seven years ago and has enough experience in this field. \r\n\r\nHe has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

","en":"Hakim is 51 and lives in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. He has a loving wife and three caring daughters. His wife is a homemaker and does not work. As head of the household, Hakim provides for his family and has worked many different jobs over the years so that his family would not lack for anything. Now his daughters are grown up and ready to get married. He should already be saving up for their weddings. Hakim went to a vocational high school and has driving experience.

She is married and has four dependent kids, who are in school. She has three hectares of cassava farmland and one hectare of rainy season paddy, which she has farmed for five years, and which have earned her about 40,000 KHR per day. Poy has been with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) for four cycles. After the past successful loan, which she has completely repaid, she feels confident that she can relieve her family\u2019s burdens better than before. Poy is now forming a group of three to take out a new loan from VisionFund.

is 41 years old. He lives in Samtredia District with his wife, parents and two children. Vakhtang applied for a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were always rejected, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a greenhouse, where cucumbers are grown. Besides that, they have a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested nuts and cucumbers at local markets. It hardly provides enough for food for the family. \r\nAccording to Credo\u2019s evaluations, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Vakhtang applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Vakhtang has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provding business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the credit Vakhtang will buy a milking cow. After purchasing the cow, they will be able to produce dairy products to sell, and thus increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is 51 years old.  He is married and lives in Akhmeta district with his wife and school-aged son.  The family runs a small-scale agricultural business that has a cow whose milk is sold locally.  Aleksi\u2019s wife works as a local school principal and receives a monthly salary.  Aleksi has made multiple loan requests, without success, from the local financial institutions in order to start up a trading business.  His loan requests were rejected each time due to low income.  \r\n\r\nAleksi\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions.  Borrowers are the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u2018high-risk borrowers\u2019 because of their low income.  With the received credit, Aleksi will purchase basic groceries and set up a store.

She has secondary education. After finishing high school, Ayat got married. She works as an operator at a gas station. Her husband works with providing passengers services to the public. \r\n\r\nSince 1991 Ayat has been engaged in livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business with an amount of 15,000 som (KGS). The family's monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ayat's patience and persistent work, she currently has a small farm with four dairy cows. Further she has 1 hectare of irrigated land available, on which she grows clover, sweet corn and potatoes. The income made it possible for Ayat to multiply the number of livestock, and thereby increase the family's well-being. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Ayat turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of livestock. Ayat plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock. In the near future, they would like to build a dacha (second\/seasonal home)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":482.18,"image":{"id":1384309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Nanuli requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for the family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milking cow and 2 calves, whose milk is used in cheese products. They sell approximately 15-20 kg. cheese during a month at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNanuli requested a loan from Credo to start-up the family business. Nanuli has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Nanuli will purchase all the needed equipment and open a wood workshop. As the needed equipment is bought, they will be able to produce wooden materials for selling. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is 48 years old and lives in the Akhmeta district with his wife, son and a daughter-in-law. Rezo has requested several previous loans from local financial institutions for his family business start-up but without success. His loan requests have been rejected many times because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only income source for the family is the small amount earned by Rezo working as an artisan locally. Rezo is requesting a loan from Credo to restart his family business, which he had to stop due to financial problems. He will use his loan to purchase two pregnant pigs for starting an animal husbandry business. He will put the pigs in a shed in the yard and after several months the family will be able to sell the piglets for a good price. Rezo's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program supports the rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income.

The start-up loan program envisages the provisions of business start-ups and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the increased credit, Gela will purchase building materials, all the kitchen appliances, and stocks of products that will be used for starting the caf\u00e9.

She has a higher education. She started a business in 2012 with 25,000 somons. She rented a storefront, opened a barber shop there, and also rents wedding dresses. Thanks to her hard work and patience, Saida was successful and began receiving a monthly profit of 14,000 somons (KGS). In addition, she grows flowers and fir trees, which she sells. In order to further grow her business, Saida has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" Microfinance Bank to request a loan in the amount of 80,000 somons (KGS) for the purchase of wedding dresses and decorations. She also hopes to repair the barber shop.

She has faced recurring challenges in life, among which is inadequate finance to start up a business and cover her family needs. Marital problems also have been a main difficulty for her. With this loan, she plans to invest in buying vegetables of all types, such as hackberries, cabbages, and all types of green spices. Also, part of the loan will be invested in buying and selling potatoes. She believes this business will succeed, because she has been doing this for a long time, and she believes that there is high demand for foodstuffs in the region, due to increases in population, which will provide a market for the items she sells. The community will benefit from this business activity because, with the profit from this loan, she will cover her family\u2019s needs, ensure her child\u2019s education, and renovate her house. She prefers GHAPE loans because of the social talks given during GHAPE meetings and the convenient repayment schedule for the loan.

In particular, they have a milking cow, whose milk is used in cheese products. In addition, they have a hectare of agricultural land where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the produced cheese and vegetables at local markets. It is hardly enough money for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nZaira requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Zaira has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

These rural poor people are regarded as 'high-risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Zaira will open a grocery shop.

She is a nurse by profession and works at the birth and delivery center.  In search of an additonal income for her family, Jyldyzkan started to breed livestock and got involved in farming in 1999, having started this business with a sum of 15,000 som (KGS).  The family's monthly profit is 8,000 som (KGS).  Her husband is a construction worker and helps with the household business.  To-date, Jyldyzkan was able to develop her farming business and have her own farm.  Her farm contains two dairy cows, three bulls and twenty sheep, and also has 2.40 hectares of irrigated land, where she annually grows beans.  In order to further grow her farming and animal husbandry business, Jyldyzkan requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy one bull and nine sheep.

is 27 years old, married and has three children (two sons and one daughter).  She got married right after finishing school.  She has been involved in farming since 2007, having started this business with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  The family's monthly income is 8,000 som (KGS).  To-date, she was able to develop her farming business and have her own farm.  Her farm contains one dairy cow, one calf, two horses and twenty sheep.  The family is very friendly and hardworking.  They also have 1.60 hectares of irrigated land, and 2 hectares of rainfed land, where she annually grows potatoes and perennial herbs, such as clover.  In order to further grow her farming and animal husbandry business, Jazgul requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy fertilizers for potatoes and to buy one cow.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing livestock quantities on her farm.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1384143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

La idea de comprar  los animales es para lograr los pastos que crecen de forma natural en la parte alta del volc\u00e1n en la \u00e9poca de lluvias que es un terreno que antiguamente era una finca y ahora pr\u00e1cticamente es del estado.

Pero eso ya paso comenta Wilber, le agradece  a su mama que le dio la vida y a su padre que le ense\u00f1o a trabajar. ","en":"Wilber is 21 and single.  He was born in a rural area in the foothills of the volcano.  His parents grew corn and beans and that is how he learned how to grow crops.  When he was 12, he used $11.42 of his savings to buy a calf which appeared to be on the verge of death.  It was small and skinny but he took care of it and fed it with the leftovers from crop harvests and it grew.  He sold it for $150 and used the money to buy two bigger bullocks.  Since then he has devoted himself to breeding bullocks and taming them so that they pull carts and ploughs.  After a year, he sells them (now bigger and tame enough to do heavy pulling work) for a higher price, and then buys some more and tames them, with the help of his older brother.  He obtains his agricultural supplies in the city, transporting them down the 10 kilometers from the foothills of the volcano by bus or van.  Then, if he does not have too many of them, he carries them on his back but, when he has more, he uses oxen to transport them. They cannot carry very much, but his plot of land is one kilometer away from the bus stop, at the top of a slope.  \n\nHe will use the loan he is seeking from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy two bullocks and some supplies  to sow 1.4 hectares of corn in August and 0.7 hectares of red beans in September.  He wants to buy the bullocks to graze the pasture which grows naturally in the rainy season on the upper slopes of the volcano.  This land was previously a farm and now is practically state property. The team of young bullocks feed on the natural pasture until they grow a little and then, in the summer when there is no pasture, they feed on leftovers from the corn and bean harvest and are tamed so they can pull the cart.  He wants to be able to buy the necessary supplies to grow his crops; this year they will sow a further 0.07 hectares of corn.  \n \nThe idea of working a bit more is because he wants to improve his home, which is currently made of wattle and daub with a corrugated iron roof, and one day, build it with bricks and blocks. He and his brothers share this dream because they are alone, as their mother separated from their father some years ago and then their father found a new partner.  But, as Wilber says, that is all now in the past and he thanks his mother for giving birth to him and his father for teaching him his trade.

She hopes with this loan to be able to finish the project which will provide more security and comfort for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":338.65,"image":{"id":1385481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy building supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2013-07-09T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-08T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.07,"local_amount":1676.73,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1691.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399979409,"comment":null},{"amount":79.25,"local_amount":1981.24,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1998.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409995841,"comment":null},{"amount":64.94,"local_amount":1623.39,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1637.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419760431,"comment":null},{"amount":70.03,"local_amount":1750.76,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429410538,"comment":null},{"amount":57.36,"local_amount":1433.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T09:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1446.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439929603,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T02:40:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":580691,"name":"Kokor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kokor lives in New Kru town, which is one of the oldest communities in Liberia.

Moussa would like to take a loan for a semoir, which is a local seeding machine that has 2 boxes: one for seed and one for fertilizer.  The semoir is attached to a cow that will pull the semoir along the field, and there are diggers and a pipe behind each box that will place the correct amount of seed and fertilizer the correct distance apart. This enables farmers to plant using the micro-dosing method of planting \u2013 using a small amount of fertilizer per plant instead of the traditional method of broadcasting fertilizer.  This is less expensive since it uses less fertilizer and much better for land sustainability as well.  myAgro hopes that by providing the semoir on loan, Moussa will be able to increase the amount of land he plants using the micro-dosing method and significantly increase his farm income.  \n\nTogether with myAgro's high-quality inputs and regular trainings, he is confident that he will have a plentiful harvest.
