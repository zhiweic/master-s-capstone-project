Growing coffee is one of the main economic activities of their region.  Some years ago, the coffee business here was very difficult, with the value of coffee being very low.  What the family produced gave them very little profit and there were even many people in the region who lost their farms.  Nonetheless, Ismael continued to work as ever and coffee has now regained its value.  Ismael's objective is to increase his production, from five tonnes to ten tonnes, over the next three harvests.  To make this possible he needs to look after his plants and use organic fertiliser.  For this reason he needs a loan. He knows that if he spends the money well, he will have good results.

is from the village of Angeghakot in the Syuniq region. He lives with his parents. Saqo is the only breadwinner of the family. He is a contractual serviceman in the army. Unfortunately, however, his salary alone is not enough to cover the basic needs of the family. The most important source of income is the family's cows and pigs and the cultivation of wheat, beech, potatoes, apples, pears and nuts. Saqo's parents help him a lot with the farming activities. Saqo currently is eager to develop his agribusiness.

to work every day like it is a holiday. It is especially nice if one has known her profession since childhood and to go with it from an early age. \r\n\r\nHere Dilafruz has been lucky. From a young age, she has loved to cook and bake different kinds of sweets. And she still cooks because she is a pastry chef. She knows all about baking pastries. Most of all, she loves to bake cakes. Anyone who has tried her cakes has been pleasantly surprised. She learned to cook from her sister who is also a pastry chef, but her sister likes cooking pies and biscuits more. The two young women so love to cook that their craving for delicious and beautiful things has turned them into real masters. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Dilafruz is requesting a loan for repairs to the pastry shop. After the repairs, the place will be spacious and it will be comfortable for her to work in a new environment.

This is 47-year-old Fatmata from Lunsar Northern area. She is married with five children between the ages of 12 years and 30 years. Two of her children are attend school. \r\n\r\nFatmata runs a used-clothing business; she sells clothes for females and males. She has been running this business for 20 years. She works at the business 12 hours per day, seven days per week. Fatmata says that the main challenge to her business is high transportation costs due to high petrol costs.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to purchase more clothing items for males and females.

With her remaining money, she opened her provisions and drinks shop in 2006.\r\n\r\nWorking six days a week and ten hours a day, Mariatu earns about 1,500,000 SLL every month. She would like a loan of 4,500,000 SLL in order to buy crates of soft drinks, crates of Maltina, cartons of sardines, and cartons of Peak Milk.

He lives with his wife, father, and two little kids. He has been involved in an agricultural business for more than eight years and is the only breadwinner of his family. Currently Suren breeds a livestock including cows, sheep, and pigs. Near the village where Suren lives, he also owns a plot of land where tomato is being cultivated. By selling agricultural products in the local markets, Suren gets the income, which is vital for his family's well-being.\r\n\r\nSo now, this hardworking farmer asks a loan of USD 3000. He will use it to purchase cows, pigs and forage. Suren has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately was not able to pay it back. However, thanks to his hard work during the more recent times, Suren was able to run his agricultural business in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments.

However, it was not an easy path. Born with severely clubbed feet, she wore casts on her legs for the first nine months of her life. Her doctors doubted whether she would ever walk normally, but Larisa had other plans! At 18 months, she took her first steps, and at age five, Larisa turned to dance to strengthen her feet. She struggled with ankle pain throughout childhood, but she kept on dancing, stricken with what she calls \u201cthe fever\u201d! \n\nLarisa continued dancing and won numerous competitions. She recalls dancing in the 2001 Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, as part of the Tap Dancing Christmas Trees, just two months after September 11. \u201cIt was surreal being in New York at that time,\u201d she shared. Dancing helped build Larisa\u2019s self-confidence and gave her a sense of pride.  Her experiences motivated her to help others overcome their obstacles and to experience the joy of dance. \n\nIn her 20\u2019s, Larisa moved to San Diego and was determined to set up a dance studio. She then researched local dance studies and realized that there were few tap dance opportunities in San Diego. As a result, in 2008, she opened Tap Fever Studios, a non-profit dance school with a focus on tap. Tap Fever\u2019s mission is building self-esteem, athleticism and giving back to the community. Classes include tap, jazz, ballet, contemporary, hip-hop and partner dancing. Tap Fever provides accessible classes for people with disabilities, dance scholarships and mentoring for teens. \n\nThe summer months are typically the slowest times for dance studios, as people go on vacations. To help stabilize cash flows during the summer months, Larisa turned to her bank for a loan, but was unable to qualify for a traditional loan. Her banker suggested that she apply for a Kiva loan through Accion San Diego, a microfinance lender. \n\nA Kiva loan of $5,000 helps pay the studio\u2019s rent and utilities for the summer months and ensures that Tap Fever\u2019s programs continue to give people of all ages, backgrounds, physical abilities and incomes the opportunity to experience the joy of dance. \n\n\u201cIt is so rewarding to see the joy of students who are visually impaired, on crutches or others who just want to get healthier,\u201d she shared. \n\nFor more information on Tap Fever Studios and its mission, go to

To achieve his goal, Santos has enrolled in the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Caranavi. He plans on graduating in December, 2013, but without a loan from Vittana, he fears that he will need to defer his graduation. \n\nSantos plans on using the loan to pay his graduation fee. This fee is often more expensive than the semester's tuition and is a frequent impediment for graduating students in Caranavi.

He works as a solar lamp distributor in Mali.\r\n\r\nPrior to becoming a distributor for NOTS, Daniel studied agriculture and engineering and worked as a farm manager at a Malian textile company.   Upon learning about the work of NOTS Mali, he was very motivated to become a distributor because he knew solar lamps would be a great benefit to people living in the rural areas where he lived and worked.  \r\n\r\nDaniel sells solar lamps directly to farmers and through small retailers and individual entrepreneurs in Sikasso, the southern-most region in Mali.   Most people living in this area work in agriculture and about 80% of the population does not have access to electricity.  They rely, instead, on kerosene, flashlights and candles for light and they must walk long distances and pay to charge their mobile phones.  On top of being harmful to the environment, time-consuming, and damaging to users' health (inhaling kerosene fumes is like smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day), these energy sources are expensive, costing a family at least $80 per year.   \r\n\r\nA solar lamp has a lifetime of about 5 years and costs $25.  Purchasing a solar lamp is a win-win-- families benefit because they save time and money and they are safer and healthier and the environment benefits from less toxic waste and reduced CO2 emissions caused by kerosene use. \r\n\r\nThe funds from Kiva investors will allow Daniel to purchase solar lamps and sell them to cotton and sesame farmers on credit.  These lamps will impact approximately 4,000 lives.  Harvest season starts in September, so it is a good time for Daniel to sell lamps as the farmers will have some money to pay for the lamps.  It is difficult, however, for them to pay in one lump-sum payment, so Daniel will collect payments in installments.  This way farmers can access solar light without so much financial strain on their household."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":20275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1435524,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2884,"youtubeId":"Vz2drUJADmo","title":"Kiva Borrower Daniel from Mali","thumbnailImageId":1434170},"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","use":"To buy solar lamps that he will sell to cotton and sesame farmers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":"2013-09-20T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-20T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":20275,"lender_count":613,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":9828160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":20275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":9828160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-23T18:33:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606510,"name":"Tarbiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tarbiya is 57 years old.She is married and she has 6 beautiful kids.

As of July 2013, 54,273 Americans benefited from SSI.  It is through Jose\u2019s business, Gaucin Disability Advocacy, that qualifying citizens in San Antonio and its surrounding areas are able to receive the complete amount they are due since they are unable to work.\r\n\r\nJose says Gaucin Disability Advocacy offers representation, a service not available at any other law firm. Within his business, Jose offers \u201crespect to beneficiaries and so many deserving members of our community, and (my) experience to win disabled claims in a timely fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf ever in doubt about the process of his business, Jose says the Social Security Administration offers technical advice and assistance online, through the phone, or in person.  This ensures that Gaucin Disability Advocacy is complying with Federal procedures. \r\n\r\nThough Jose has seven years\u2019 experience working for the Social Security Administration, he recognized his weakness in marketing his business within his hometown.  Needing to strengthen his weakness, Jose searched for a business loan.  After learning of nonprofit microlender Accion Texas, Inc., he applied for a loan to ramp up his marketing abilities. With his loan, Jose was able to develop an image for his business and better advertise his services.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am passionate towards helping the disabled in their needs,\u201d Jose says.

So Delgertsogt is requesting a loan of MNT 4,300,000 to purchase building and insulation materials, such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass, and foam. Using those materials, he can finally repair and insulate his house, thus creating a comfortable and warm place for his family. \r\n\r\nAlso the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal for heating, and reduced coal usage has positive impact on environment as fewer pollutants will be released into atmosphere.

I have a little bit of a problem in adaptation with others because most of my friends are using traditional Javanese language. I am a newcomer in Java, and my origin place is Kalimantan\/Borneo Island where the language is different from Java Island. But it\u2019s all right; I feel comfort here since actually they are friendly, and the teachers are nice, too. I joined youth church activity called TERAMO. I am able to manage my time well for both of my school and church activities.The financial condition of my family is not good. My parents are poor, and we also have debt to the bank, so they cannot pay my school fees. Now, I am standing near the \u201cDropout Gate\u201d. Hopefully, to all generous Kiva lenders, I would like to ask you to help me so that I can carry on my study, and at last I can reach the dream of my life. My hometown is Sajiram. It is geographically hilly, rocky and far from a big city. The job of my father is a government officer. His salary per month is between 1 \u2013 3 million rupiahs. The number of children in the family is four, including me. Their ages are 7 years, 11 years, 13 years and 17 years old.If I am given the Kiva loan from lenders, I will spend it to pay my school fees. At school, I learn many lessons, for example, English, computer and networking (my vocational majority), chemistry, math, Indonesian language and so on. I chose the computer and networking because I am interested in computers; computers are unseparated things from the world and human life. Besides that, I want to be a computer expert.After graduation, I want to get a job in a foreign company. (There are) some fun (parts) about school, such as having new friends and sharing each other.\nIn the picture, Ferdinandus and Benediktus his

In addition, Ana Celea also works with sewing activities, which represents an additional income for the family. Her parents left her a small piece of land located 15 minutes away from where they live and in which, together with her husband, she started producing coffee six years ago. They have learned a lot from this work. They sell the coffee locally. Every member in the family is involved and they were taught to work hard and remain together since they were very young.\n\nHer biggest dream is that her younger daughters can become professionals and can have a better future; this is why she and her husband fight to make it come true. She is requesting a loan to buy agricultural supplies to keep their crops in good health and obtain a good product when the harvesting time comes.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct sales brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer, then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVangie hopes to have a good life and dreams of expanding her business.

With their business they meet many challenges, but they realized that it is good to face the challenges rather than get discouraged. \r\n\r\nBaby Grace and her husband work hard selling their catch in the market. Sometimes there are wholesale buyers from other towns and cities who come to buy their fish. With their savings, they welcome the idea of expanding their business.
