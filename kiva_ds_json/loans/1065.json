She belongs to a group called El Capulin (The Cherry Tree) because where they meet there is a big leafy tree and they decided to name themselves that to better locate the group. More than 40 years ago her mother taught her the art of knitting wool to create clothing like zarape shawls, blankets, hats, scarves, coats, and other shawls of this pretty and very warm material, as sheep are raised easily in her area and from them they get the raw material to make their woolen creations. Mrs. Regina also makes napkins, tablecloths and cushions, and sells them in the areas surrounding her community. \r\n\r\nSometimes she is invited to expo fairs in areas where regional artisan work is exhibited. She is currently asking for a loan to buy material. She says in words that are half cut off, as she doesn't know how to speak Spanish very well, \u201cI need a loan to buy material, the Zitacuaro expo fair will be happening soon and I barely have anything to sell. I want to buy yarn, fabric, needles and hooks to be able to make clothing, and get my granddaughters to help me  so I can finish soon and take advantage of the expo.\u201d She says that she is grateful for what VisionFund is doing because sometimes people in the community discriminate against her for her appearance; they don't want to give her loans to improve her quality of life and to improve her business above all. The other group members are named Aurelia, Juan, Juan H. and Abraham.

He tells us that from a very young age he found a liking for business as, as a child, he used to help his mother in her business selling seasonal fruits.  He is part of a group called \"Ojo de agua\" (natural pool in English) as where the group meets and collects its loans, there is a natural pool that supplies water to the community.  Miguel is married to Heliodora and they have two children.  One is taking preparatory courses for university while the younger is at secondary school.  Miguel says that he has had his fruit and vegetable business for 22 years as, when he married, his mother helped him to set up his own stall, so that he could look after his family.  Miguel buys his seasonal fruit and vegetables in the town's central market.  He has to go very early in order pick the best and freshest fruit, so that it is not bruised, and so he can sell it for a better price.  He goes out to sell his fruit in different markets in the state and he says he likes his a lot as he has afternoon free to look after his children and family.  He says he is applying for a loan with Vision Fund because he wants to stock up his stall as the high season for selling is coming.

He hasn't left farming behind as he continues at a smaller scale.\r\nThe loan he is requesting from Fundacion Campo is to buy two cows and an industrial sewing machine to make private school uniforms and any other work that comes his way from others. He'll use the small parcel of land he owns to lead the cows to pasture as well as satisfy the demand for tailored clothing. His dream is to own a place for his tailor shop and buy a car, as he has to move around to faraway areas.\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1303266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"buy two cows and an industrial sewing machine to make private school uniforms and any other work that comes his way from others","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-02-27T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-29T23:00:05Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Bautista","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1600,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814804,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T18:01:58Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:26:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":532798,"name":"Martha Ilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha es una humilde mujer de origen campesino, habita en la linda ciudad de Estel\u00ed, es soltera y tiene cuatro hijos todos mayores, profesionales e independiente.\n\nMartha se caracteriza por ser una mujer trabajadora y con mucho amor a su familia actualmente es trabajadora de una institucion estatal desempe\u00f1\u00e1ndose como conserje por m\u00e1s de 29 a\u00f1os trabajando para esta empresa, es as\u00ed que Martha siendo una madre soltera ha podido darle una mejor forma de vida ya que logro con su esfuerzo que todos sus hijos se profesionalizaran.\n\n Martha solicita un cr\u00e9dito que lo  va a invertir para pago de mano de obra ya que est\u00e1 realizando la construcci\u00f3n de un cuarto de habitaci\u00f3n en su vivienda, a si poder darle una mejor condici\u00f3n a su vivienda y comodidad a su familia.\n\nElla manifiesta sentirse alegre por el apoyo que le puede brindar por que har\u00e1 realidad sus proyecto personales.\n","en":"Martha is a humble woman from the country.

She is married to Jos\u00e9 with whom she has three children aged 15, 10, and six. They live in their own house which was the result of their hard work. \r\n\r\nKarina works selling groceries and staple goods such as cereal, rice, bread, eggs, oil, milk, etc. Every three days, she buys her supplies at wholesale in the main city market where she can purchase the goods at affordable prices. This helps her to make a few more cents profit on them. She has her store in a small section of her home. She has been running her store for two years, and has worked on her own from the beginning. What she likes about her job is that it gives her the opportunity to carry out other tasks. What she doesn\u2019t like is that there are always people who want to buy products on credit, and that don\u2019t pay her when they are supposed to. This is why she prefers to receive full payments in cash. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to grow her business even more and have a bigger store so that she can be more successful.

She took a big risk starting this business and fortunately her income from it has helped her improve her financial situation. She is requesting a loan of 2,500 PEN (approx. US $975) to buy t-shirts, pants, blouses, shirts, etc. She is happy to know she has financial support that will allow her to move forward in her work and she promises to be punctual with her payments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1303253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-27T23:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-29T23:40:09Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Griselda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":369.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":399.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":398.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":429.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":445.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":457.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.96,"local_amount":369.13,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":372.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869016,"comment":null},{"amount":155.95,"local_amount":399.86,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":403.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577856,"comment":null},{"amount":155.34,"local_amount":398.31,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":401.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530087,"comment":null},{"amount":167.55,"local_amount":429.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":433.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975118,"comment":null},{"amount":173.8,"local_amount":445.64,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":449.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996387,"comment":null},{"amount":178.4,"local_amount":457.44,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":461.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863872,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-15T22:47:31Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529833,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel is a 34-year-old married man with one child.

Her biggest challenge is: 'Pests and diseases.' The animal on the farm is named: 'Kanini.'\n\nFlorence was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'The interest rate for Juhudi is bearable.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi Kilimo's required micro-finance training session: 'Juhudi Kilimo field loan officers visit the clients to help them manage the groups and repay the loans promptly.'\n\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Florence replied: 'Better education for the children.'\n\nAs part of Juhudi Kilimo's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Florence owns the following: 'poultry, pump, bicycle,' but does not own: 'cow, pig, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards, based on this loan. This borrower has in the household: 'mosquito net, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD,' but does not have: 'electricity.'\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

He is married and is the father of three children. Rahmonberdi and his family live in a remote, mountainous region. His wife is a homemaker and takes care of their children. For over 15 years, Rahmonberdi has been fattening up cattle and knows all about the advantages of this business. In the region where he lives, this type of business is very important. Rahmonberdi buys young calves at the livestock market and, after fattening them for a little while, sells them for a favorable price. This business is the family's only source of income and he strives to expand it. Rahmonberdi has wanted to buy a car for a long time; he has dreamed about it his whole life. He has savings, but not enough for a car. Now he plans to increase his number of cattle and with the acquired profit, buy a car. \r\n\r\nWith the received loan, Rahmonberdi plans to buy cattle.

She has only one dependent, her father. Celedonia has a grocery store which she opened 15 years ago because she lived alone with her elderly parents. It was Celedonia's responsibility to take care of them and give them what they needed. They saw that it was very viable to establish a store in the community because often people had to walk far to be able to buy food, drinks or snacks. Now Celedonia talks: \u201cBefore we sold a lot now sales have lowered by a lot because other people have also opened up corner shops\u201d. Celedonia worries about this because now her father is ill and if things continue this way if the day comes that her father gets worse they will not have money for medication. The only thing that Celedonia wants is that her profits increase a little only to have money for her father's medicine for when he gets ill. \r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting a loan to supply her grocery store. She will buy milk, bread, eggs, sugar, salt, refreshments, water, fried snacks, detergents etc... Caledonia and the other members are thankful for the loan because they will be able to invest it.

His business is set up in his house and every day he opens his doors to receive students and the public in general.  Currently he has 6 computers for use by his customers, who pay a determined sum to use the service.\r\n\r\nHe works alone, but sometimes his cousin helps him.

What he likes about his work is that it has allowed him to have sustainable income, with which he can pay the household bills and improve his financial situation.\r\n\r\nWhat he doesn't like about his work is that often the internet connection slows or fails, which is detrimental to the fast access of webpages.

Her loan request was always rejected because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is the monthly salary of Tengiz, who is working as a driver for a private company, and the small pension of Nunu\u2019s father. It is hardly enough for food for a four-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNunu requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Nunu will purchase a milk cow and pigs.

The two oldest are in school.  She is from Le\u00f3n, in the northern part of the country.  In her free time, Rosa enjoys spending time with her children and preparing regional food such as \"sopa de leche, cajetas\" (caramel).  Rosa is known as a hard-working, responsible person who always has helped cover household expenses since she was very young.  Unfortunately, she was unable to get a degree due to lack of resources, but she would have liked to become a social worker.\r\n\r\nThanks to her determination to get ahead, she runs a business selling hand-made mattresses in different bed sizes: double, twin or crib.  In the photo we see a twin size mattress.  She has been in business for four years, working both as a street vendor and from home.  Every day Rosa works about nine hours offering her products to fixed and eventual customers.  She enjoys her work as it is a source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nThe object of the loan is to buy more mattresses so she can increase her income in the near future.

is 47 years old. She is married and lives in Kareli District with her husband, Grigol, and two children, who go to school. Iamze requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a hectare of agricultural land, where haricot nut trees and cherry trees are grown. Besides thhis, her husband works as an artisan and gets a monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIamze requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Iamze will purchase a milk cow. After purchasing a milk cow, she plans to produce dairy products and increase the income of the family. A small part of the loan will be used to cultivate the land for sowing seeds. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

responsible and punctual 35-year old man. He is married and has three children. Bahodir busy and resells cattle. He has started this business 10 years ago. He values his work as it allows him to support himself. At the beginning, Bahodir had only two sheep; after fattening the animals, he sold them at a good price and was very glad to do so. In this way, he kept increasing his sales volume. At present Bahodir already knows how to manage the business to his advantage. \r\n\r\nAfter increasing his revenues, Bahodir has been able to buy a store in the middle of his village.

Together with his wife Darlina, he is bringing up two children aged three and four. Darlina has been indispensible to running their 1.5 acre cacao farm, and has been helping with activities like cleaning and harvesting. Besides help with maintaining the farm and taking care of the family, she also does local Maya crafts like woven goods from jippi jappa palm. \n\nCacao, the only cash crop in many of the local Mayan communities throughout Belize\u2019s southernmost district of Toledo, is also the sole source of income for the family at the moment. For Roberto, harvesting is his favorite part of cacao farming because it is also the most rewarding, as compensation is immediate. Farmers have the option to either sell their cacao fresh or fermented and dried, providing leeway to develop expertise in processing or to instead focus more on the farming itself. Fresh cacao are the seeds of cacao fruit covered with a sweet pulp that begins fermenting shortly after the fruit is cracked open. The most challenging thing about cacao for this young farmer has been trying to keep the monilia fungal disease from spreading in his farm. \n\nIn the future, Roberto wants to expand the family farm, build a comfortable home and save money to invest in the education of the children. An entrepreneur in spirit, Roberto is looking at business opportunities to create alternative sources of income for the family as well. The couple is requesting this loan to expand their cacao farm by 1,000 new trees, more than doubling the current number. To prepare for the expansion, they will hire five men for seven days to clean the area to be planted, and bag cacao seeds. The first step in planting new cacao is raising a seedling in a bag filled with topsoil to make it ready for transplantation into the ground. Once a seedling has four or more leaves, it is ready for planting, and can be expected to become productive in three to five years after. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1303398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand cacao farm by 1000 trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-28T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-30T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":47.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971176,"comment":null},{"amount":44.73,"local_amount":89.46,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":90.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751701,"comment":null},{"amount":17.22,"local_amount":34.44,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":34.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993442,"comment":null},{"amount":38.9,"local_amount":77.81,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":78.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255611,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":69.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136451,"comment":null},{"amount":0.27,"local_amount":0.54,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":0.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900668,"comment":null},{"amount":90.76,"local_amount":181.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":183.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088549,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T19:35:29Z","paid_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":532872,"name":"Evaristo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evaristo, 48, and his wife Pantiola live in the village of San Antonio, in Belize\u2019s southernmost district of Toledo. They are raising nine children, aged four to 19, three of whom are currently in school and seven live at home. Pantiola is busy taking care of the large family, but also oversees fermentation and drying of cacao. Fermentation stops cacao beans from further ripening and softens their bitter flavor, and drying makes the beans crunchy and further develops their flavor. \n\nWith the help of his children, Evaristo maintains a large cacao farm with around productive 4,500 trees, planted about nine years ago. He initially started to plant encouraged by the arrival of Hershey\u2019s Chocolate in Belize in the early 90\u2019s, but his farm was damaged in the aftermath of the Hurricane Iris in 2001. Evaristo replanted his trees the next season and reached full production again a few years back. A cacao tree typically takes three to five years from the time it is transplanted in the ground to become productive, and continues bearing fruit for decades thereafter. A tree\u2019s productivity is affected by a myriad of factors including tree maintenance, amount of shade, and soil health. \n\nEvaristo is happy with the state of his farm, especially because he\u2019s been able to keep diseases like the fungal infection monilia in check and not affecting his cacao production. While he enjoys all aspects of cacao farming, Ewaristo says cleaning is by far the most challenging, because a large farm like his takes approximately 80 days to clean on his own. Cleaning is the process of chopping underbrush to keep the farm tidy, with healthy airflow and access to the trees for pruning and harvesting. Farmers in the lush tropical lowlands of Belize have to repeat cleaning around three times a year. In the future, Evaristo hopes to have a model cacao farm and to start growing other fruit trees and fresh vegetables. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to hire help to clean around the 4,500 cacao trees, a job that will require five men to work about 25 days on the farm. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1303399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean around 4,500 cacao trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Antonio","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-28T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-30T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evaristo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":47.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971177,"comment":null},{"amount":47.85,"local_amount":95.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751702,"comment":null},{"amount":24.11,"local_amount":48.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":48.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993443,"comment":null},{"amount":24.23,"local_amount":48.46,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":48.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255612,"comment":null},{"amount":130.06,"local_amount":260.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":262.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136452,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T23:27:12Z","paid_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533240,"name":"Pricila Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pricila del Carmen es una joven mujer de treinta y cuatro a\u00f1os de edad madre de dos ni\u00f1os de 2 y 14 a\u00f1os de edad, el mayor cursa segundo a\u00f1o de la secundaria. tiene por actividad econ\u00f3mica la elaboraci\u00f3n de tortillas desde hace 4 anos que se dedica a dicha actividad.

After she got married, her financial problems started. She gave birth to three children and raised them. Her husband was not able to keep a stable job and Nodira did not work. \r\n\r\nThis year, her husband went to the Russian Federation and found appropriate work. The children also grew up and Nodira can do her work. She plans to set up a new business of buying and reselling livestock, as she has a large garden and is able to grow fodder for the livestock herself.

","en":"Mamur is a man of the age of 63. He is married and has three children. His wife is a housewife. Mamur works with growing apricots. In the summer he collects apricots and dries them, and in the winter he sells these dry apricots at the market. \r\n\r\nMamur built a new house not long ago, and he would like to install a stove for winter heating. This winter was very hard for them as their old stove was out of order and could not be repaired. It was very cold. Not long ago, Mamur was told by his acquaintances that \"Arvand\" issues energy-saving stoves on credit through the product \"green credit\". He was very happy that he got such an opportunity to purchase such a stove, with which it is possible to both heat the house, prepare food and bake cakes. His wife was also very happy after she discovered this. \r\n\r\nThey decided to purchase this stove and turned to the organization \"Arvand\". Mamur hopes for support from \"Arvand\" and the realization of his

Juliet, a 27-year-old is a single mother of a 4-year-old who has just started kindergarten.She sells electricals--a business she started a year ago with the help of funds from a friend and later additional funds from Ugafode Micro-finance Ltd.

He is a good family man and does not have any bad habits. \n\nAs a thankful man and father, Sobir would like to build his son a house and not be in need of anything in the future. He saved up money for seven years to build the house, but he still does not have enough money for such large expenditures. At the advice of his acquaintances he turned to the \"Arvand\" organization for financial support. Sobir plans to use the loan received to purchase building materials and build a big house for his only son. \n\nDespite his young age, Sobir has already planted a few trees, he is raising a son and of course, like a real man, is building a house.

In the mornings, Paulino works as a taxi driver, \"On harvesting days, I stop working in transportation and I take my vehicle to the farm,\" he affirms. \r\n\r\nSince his principal source of income is farming, Paulino has his own plots of land located a few hours away from his house. For this reason, he leaves very early in the morning to work. He has 20 years of experience since he learned this trade when he was a young boy. \"I farmed and had my own animals, but I moved to the city so that my children could study.

is engaged in agriculture. She keeps four cows and 80 sheep. Almast has been involved in agriculture for more than fifteen years, and it has become a part of her life. She breeds cattle to get milk which she uses in cheese production. Due to her hard work, her cheese is in strong demand among the buyers. Almast works hard to meet her clients' demand and sustain her family. As agriculture helps Almast to get income and cover her family's daily costs she would like to expand the business.

She is 38 years old and married with four children, aged 4 to 22.  All four of her children currently attend school. Margaret operates a business six days per week selling palm oil, gari and wood from her house. She started her business to improve herself and educate her children.  She says that getting a vehicle to take her while she is carrying her inventory is difficult and is a challenge she faces in the business.  She requested this loan to purchase more palm oil, wood and gari for her business.  In five years, she hopes to be able to own her own shop.

He lives with his wife and children, whom he loves a lot.  Despite the adversities he has faced in life, he continues to be closer than ever to his family.  Because of his scarce economic resources Marco only managed to study  up to the fifth year of secondary school, but he would like to have studied the field of human medicine.\r\n\r\nEvery day Marco strives to get his family ahead, which he does with his small and modest car-washing business.  He works about 10 hours a day and can serve up to 10 customers.  He believes he's getting ahead in his business because he's friendly with the customers and because his family is the driving force and best motivation for striving.\r\n\r\nMarco is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help he'll be able to buy a new tricycle to carry the pails of water he uses to wash the cars.

She works 11 hours per day, 6 days per week at her business. She started this business because she was alone and had to take care of her family. \r\n\r\nFatmata requested this loan to purchase more inventory to expand the water-and-drinks side of her business. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that in five years time, she sees her child be the first in the family to go to university.

When she was ten years old, her mother taught her how to weave with mezcal.* She began weaving hammocks and matatas (canvas bags) from maguey* and pita*. Eventually, she began making hammocks with silk thread and poly silk.  Now, she is teaching her children how to weave hammocks.  Her husband works in farming in the morning and weaves hammocks in the evening.\r\n\r\nShe buys the supplies for making the hammocks in a city that is ten minutes away.  Sometimes she travels by car and other times she walks because there is no public transportation.  She travels every fifteen to twenty days, accompanied by her husband or one of her children.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to purchase sand and cement to finish building a retaining wall for her home as the previous one was washed away in winter.  She will also buy fifty pounds of yarn and she will invest the remainder in supplies to remove water from a well that she is building.  Her home doesn\u2019t have potable water and she is currently buying it form private individuals.  In this way, she will have the supplies to continue making hammocks and satisfying customer demand.  In addition, she will have a safer home for her family.  Her dream is to continue improving her home and installing brick paving with cement and sand.  \r\n\r\n*mescal, maguey, pita \u2013 common names for the Agave plant.
