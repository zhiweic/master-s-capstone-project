She has a secondary education.  She is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this field 17 years ago when she bought livestock for 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work, Gulbara now owns two dairy cows, two young bulls, seven sheep and one horse.

She has a small monthly salary. Her husband is a worker in the beer company and gets a small monthly salary. Being a refuge, their son gets pension from the government institutions. <p>\r\n\r\nAs the income is not enough to feed such a large family and cover everyday costs, Mzia decided to start her own business and seek credit among local financial institutions.  However, her attempts were unsuccessful because of their poor living conditions. The startup program, that is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan, for starting or re-starting businesses.

She is married and her husband is a baker.  Of their three children, only two live with her and only one of those attends school.  The other is helping with the family business.\r\n\r\nShe owns a bakery where she makes French bread and pan dulce (traditional sweet bread in Latin America).  She has worked for the past year in her own business.  However, she also has 23 years of experience working in a bakery.  She learned about bakeries when she was 14 years old and began working.  She started by packaging the breads and with the passing of time she had the opportunity to learn the process of bread making.  She works in her home (where she also runs her business) and she works with the help of her husband and their two daughters.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan so that she can buy a cylinder which is equipment that is very important because it helps prepare the French bread and pan dulce. Previously she had made her bread by hand but the French bread shrinks when it's made.  With a cylinder it can maintain a larger size and her customers prefer larger sized breads.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to grow her bakery business and increase production.  She can do this by reinvesting her income into the business.  She also dreams that her daughter will one day become a professional and that she can also one day remodel her home.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":139.12,"image":{"id":1422167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to

is 50 years old, single and lives with his retired parents in the small town of Borjomi. Vladimer works as a loader at the local flour store and earns a small wage. As the family has many expenses and existing funds are not enough to cover them, Vladimer decided to start a business. He requested credit to set up a cobbler shop. Vladimer used to work as a cobbler and has enough experience in this field. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to the country's vulnerable poor. They do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Vladimer will purchase leather materials and all the needed tools for shoe-making. He will also repair shoes and get a profit. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income for the family.

Several times, she has requested loans from local credit providers, but her loan requests are always rejected because of the lack of experience in her new business.

Kakha works hard and runs an animal husbandry business. In particular, they have two milking cows, three calves, two pigs and a horse. Kakha\u2019s wife milks the cows everyday and produces dairy products to sell. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price.  As the family has only a seasonal income, Kakha decided to start an additional business and seek credit from local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.

With this loan of 1500 Georgia Laris (GEL) she will purchase clothing and household items at wholesale prices and resell them in her community door-to-door. \r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the work is hard for Nino, but she is ready to deal with the vital difficulties and develop her business gradually.

The family resides in old house on plot of land. She and her husband have been selling beef to local people by renting a stall at the outdoor market. Her two daughters both go to high school. The house they live in has been deteriorating for years so she decided to renovate and build an extension to her house. For this project, she is requesting a loan of 5000000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, planks and fiberglass as well as vacuum insulated windows and hardwood flooring. Using those materials, she and her husband will renovate and build an extension to their house before winter.

","en":"Jos\u00e9 is a 33-year-old man who has a 7 year-old-son.  He was born and bred in San Miguel but, security problems forced him to move with his family to a different place. They built their houses there in a space previously occupied by the Pan-American Highway.  For family and financial reasons he had only 4 years of primary education and now lives alone with his 7-year-old son as his partner left him for another man.  Jos\u00e9's mother lives close by and helps him with his son and does some of the housework while he does agricultural work (for himself or as a day worker) or works as builder's assistant because they are the main economic activities in the region. He works with his brother growing basic grains (corn) on a plot of land which was left unused after the state bank repossessed it.  Now the locals grow subsistence crops on the land which is 0.5 km away.  Jos\u00e9 buys his agricultural supplies in the city, which is a 10km bus-ride away, and then carries them on his back to the plot.   His son goes to the local school each morning and is in the first year of primary education.   The loan will be used to buy agricultural supplies (weed-killer and fertiliser) to sow 0.4 hectares of corn.  The aim is to use the corn to feed his family and to sell some to local tortilla sellers and thereby pay of the loan.  Jos\u00e9 hopes that the loan will enable him to produce enough grain for his family's consumption and to sell the rest to pay off the loan he has applied for.  His ambition is to see his son study for a professional career and to eventually free himself of his current commitments.  He has an existing loan from another institution which has to be repaid within two months.  He hopes to improve his living conditions and buy some furniture, as he currently only has the bare necessities.  Additionally, he does not have electricity and so having this installed is, perhaps, his most pressing need."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1413879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy weed-killer and fertiliser to sow 0.4 hectares of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-03T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-03T17:00:05Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Danilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-04T20:43:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":601781,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 38 years old and married to a farmer.

Erkebu has a higher education.  She spent many long years working as a chemistry and biology teacher at a local school.  Erkebu has been involved in animal husbandry for 40 years, having started with a purchase of livestock with 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 1 horse, 2 dairy cows and also 20 heads of small livestock, and the monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).

Her family consists of 7 people: Gayane herself, her husband, parents-in-law and three children (two of them are school age).\r\n\r\nThe income from agriculture hardly helps Gayane to cover her family's basic needs, so she would like to enlarge it. Gayane took a loan from a local financial institution before and wasn't able to repay it because of the family's poor conditions. But over years of hard work, Gayane and her family were able to farm in a way which is sustainable enough for covering monthly payments. So, Gayane has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.\r\n\r\nThe second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products, so lenders will greatly assist Gayane by giving her an opportunity to purchase 5 more colonies of bees and 3 pigs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":391,"image":{"id":1421365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for 5 colonies of bees and 3 pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Goris","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-09-03T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-03T18:00:06Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gayane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":76.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80.69},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":85.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.52},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158,"local_amount":158,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410203175,"comment":null},{"amount":78,"local_amount":78,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420157434,"comment":null},{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308509,"comment":null},{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845795,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-06T17:10:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":601857,"name":"Lenie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lenie works hard to support her family.

Amlet works very hard on his own plot of land, where nuts and persimmons are grown. In addition, he owns a dairy cow and sells the received milk.

She is very positive and hard-working, married, and has three children. She works as a nurse in one of the local clinics. Her salary is not very large, and because of this she tries to economize when possible so that there will be enough money to cover basic family needs. Zebo's husband is in Russia for work; he drives a taxi. This year Zebo's son will start university - he wants to become a financier. Zebo really wants her son to receive a better education and become the best specialist in his field. Zebo and her husband earned money and tried to save for their children's education, but not long ago Zebo married off her oldest son, and had to spend everything they saved on that special occasion. But now Zebo has no savings. She therefore turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to pay for her son's education, especially since the cost of education has risen significantly. Zebo nonetheless believes and hopes that she can give her son the opportunity to study and receive a higher education.  She also hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":130.16,"image":{"id":1301787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for study","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-03T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-03T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zebo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":144.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":149.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":154.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":164.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":170.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":176.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":188.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":194.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":201.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":215.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":222.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":230.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":238.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":246.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":253.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.93,"local_amount":144.35,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":147.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136799,"comment":null},{"amount":31.98,"local_amount":149.24,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":152.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900997,"comment":null},{"amount":33.07,"local_amount":154.3,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":157.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550179,"comment":null},{"amount":34.18,"local_amount":159.53,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":162.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774402,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T18:32:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":601622,"name":"Horonya 6 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les dix femmes de Horonya 6 sont toutes mari\u00e9es dans les familles traditionnelles.

He lives in a rented house, occupying alone a room with brick walls. The house is located in the city of La Paz. Currently he works as a fast food delivery employee for more than 10 hours a day. He makes deliveries on a motorcycle, running great risks trying to arrive on time with the orders. And with the little that he earns he has to cover his expenses for food, education, rent and pay for basic services. Consequently he is requesting a loan because he wants to take two rooms under an antichretic contract in order to save money. Antichresis is a form of rent in which a fixed amount is paid and one can live for a specified time in a place. In this instance, a place that is more comfortable for him.\r\n\r\nJuan Pablo\u2019s dream is to finish his studies in law to and have his own law office. In this way he will improve his earning and his quality of life.  This is the first time he has applied for a loan from IMPRO and KIVA.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1423040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

","en":"Isokaly is 18 years old.  He was born and raised in the countryside.  This year, Isokaly finished high school and enrolled into the Department of Foreign Languages at the Khujand State University.  Isokaly's parents are poor people.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union his father was left without a job.  His parents have always dreamed of their children obtaining university education.
