First, she creates a mold and applies a layer of paper. She almost always uses newspaper. This smooths the entire surface while fitting into irregularities in the mold. When the paper layer is dry, she repeats the process with additional layers of wet paper and a starch paste until the mask reaches the desired thickness. Afterward, she carefully peels back the mask which comes off in a block. Next, holes for the eyes and nose are drilled. She then proceeds to attach the teeth, ears, neck, hair bristles and any other addition such as rubber connections to allow movement. Horns are added based on the traditional number for decoration and\/or the number specific to the region where the masks come from. \r\n\r\nBernardina is a single mother and lives in her uncle's house with her mother. They live in El Alto in the area near 16 de Febrero.\r\n\r\nBernardina's dream in the medium term, is to have a shop where she can make masks and other crafts while at the same time reaching maximum efficiency in the various stages of production. This will result in higher product output, reduction in costs, better quality products, and the ability to export to other areas. This will increase her income and quality of life for her family.

Through hard work Ularbek today has on his farm two dairy cows, two heifers, one calf, five sheep, and also a plot of land measuring 0.48 hectares on which he grows beans, potatoes, and hay. His monthly income is 10,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni.

As an additional source of income for her family, Jyldyz raises livestock, having launched this business 10 years ago by buying livestock for 7,000 KGS. Thanks to Jyldyz' hard work, her farm now includes one dairy cow and a small land plot, where Jyldyz grows potatoes, pumpkins and perennial herbs. Jyldyz also has an apple orchard yielding a good harvest and revenue. Her monthly revenue is 8,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Jyldyz turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan   to increase her livestock by buying a cow. Jyldyz plans to use the income from her loan for an further additional livestock increase.

She is an enterprising businesswoman as she both receives income and generates income from premises that she rents out and has to keep well-maintained for her tenants. \r\n\r\nIdalides has always enjoyed business, especially selling from specialized catalogs--a job she's been doing since 2000. At that time she began selling to her neighbours and gradually added new customers. She works from 8 am to 8pm and sells a variety of merchandise such as women's accessories and cosmetics, both for cash and on account.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to have premises where her customers can buy everything they need. On a personal level her dream is to see her children with houses of their own. \r\n\r\nIdalides' biggest challenge is to increase her income; for this reason she is seeking a Kiva loan so she can increase her purchasing power. It is the time of year to take advantage of special offers from distributors. She also wants to renovate the store so she can rent it for more money.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use it to buy large volumes of merchandise such as cosmetics and women's accessories, and to license her store.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1516909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy larger quantities of cosmetics and women's accessories, and construction materials to renovate her premises","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Idalides ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":146924},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145332},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":149692},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154182},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":158808},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":163572},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":168479},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":173534},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":178740},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":184102},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":189625},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":187010}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.94},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.6},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":661083,"name":"Sixta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gracias por apoyar a Sixta en su negocio de venta de comidas pues con su cr\u00e9dito obtuvo mayores ganancias al invertirlo en materias primas e insumos, hoy el negocio tiene mayor movilidad porque la rotaci\u00f3n de compras es mayos ayudandola a disminu\u00edr los costos que de ella se derivan.

She lives 10 minutes away from the town of Soledad with her spouse. She has two daughters aged 28 and 30 years. When she arrived from her hometown, she lived with an aunt who owned a store in the year 1980. Later on, Dalgi decided to sell fried foods, and she was very well-received at the venue she set up. For that reason she added broths and meals. Then later on she bought amenities comprised of a counter, kitchenware and a stove. She finally obtained fully equipped amenities with an industrial kitchen, which she bought at a good price because the previous owner went bankrupt. That's how her first business experience went. It laid the foundation for her to aspire to set up other small businesses in a neighboring country. She ultimately returned to the town of Barranquilla, bought her house and started a new venture in her home country, but on better grounds. She currently sells various merchandise from specialized product catalogs, especially cosmetics and also natural and multipurpose products. Her biggest challenge is not having enough working capital to successfully achieve her growth potential.\r\nHer previous loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo was used for her new business renting washing machines. It was even enough for her to purchase various merchandise, which she eventually sold. This increased her liquidity and she had more sales, more customers, and improved her profits.

She and her spouse are raising 3 children. Their oldest son lives on his own, their second son is a migrant worker in Kazakhstan, and their daughter is in grade school.\r\n\r\nKynash has a vocational degree and currently works as a custodian at the local school. Kynash is a very responsible, friendly, life-loving person. She and her husband keep a farm with livestock and crops, which they started 20 years ago with a purchase of 4,000 som's worth of animals. Thanks to her hard work, today Kynash's farm has two dairy cows, two calves, and also 1.8 hectares of land on which they mostly grow beans and clover. The harvest is sold by wholesale vendors.

She raises crops and livestock, starting 23 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 4,000 KGS. Thanks to Sabira's hard work, she currently has 1 dairy cow, 10 calves, 1 horse, 10 sheep, and also farms 2.2 hectares of irrigated land and a 0.34 hectare backyard, where she mostly grows beans, clover and strawberries. She sells the crops wholesale. Sabira has all the necessary conditions to raise cattle: a barn and distant pastures.  She also has enough hay and fodder. She receives a monthly income of 16,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk, beans, and, in the summer, strawberries. In order to further grow her household, Sabira has appealed to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan for the purchase of steers for cattle breeding. Sabira plans to invest the loan income into further increasing the amount of livestock, and plans to save money to expand housing for the animals."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1514987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tash-Bashat village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-25T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":661425,"name":"Soknoeun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soknoeun is a 29-year-old resident of the Moung Russey district in Battambang province. She is also a young mother of four dependent children who are too young for schooling. To feed the family, she grows rice and pineapples as her main source of income; she also works as a paid worker for supplemental income. She has been doing this for around ten years and it has earned her about 40,000 KHR per day. Soknoeun has been with Kiva partner VisionFund for two loan cycles. Her past two loans, which she has successfully repaid, have helped her to improve her living conditions at a good pace. Now, she is leading a group of two to get a new loan from VisionFund. She is seeking 1,000,000 KHR, while her co-borrower is applying for 600,000 KHR.

She has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she started eight years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Indira now has one milk cow as well as a 1.5 hectare parcel of agricultural land on which she grows beans and potatoes, with a monthly income of 6,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Indira has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase steers to increase her number of livestock. She plans to invest profits from the loan toward further augmentation of the size of her herd, and to save toward buying more land.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1499997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy steers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu, Talas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-26T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Indira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":508.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":813.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":651117,"name":"3.10.607.08.thi\u1ec7u Ch\u00ednh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. H\u1ed3ng operates a food stall\/restaurant selling meat.

They come from the county of Murang\u2019a in central Kenya. Being members of one of the groups benefiting from credit offered by VEP, the women have previously received water tank loans, a Mifugo (livestock) loan, and a school-fees loan, among others. This time they approached VEP for bio-gas credit that could enable them to construct bio-digesters to provide them with fuel for cooking and lighting.\r\n\r\nGrace, standing on the right with a beaded necklace, has been a farmer for over ten years. However, she had no knowledge of the benefits she could reap from the animal waste\/manure her farming produced, and has all along struggled with kerosene, charcoal, and wood. She only learned about bio-gas a year ago through a training conducted by VEP in their group, and she decided to take up the project once she completed repaying her earlier loans. Her wish is to have a smoke-free kitchen, cleaner cooking pots free from soot, and no stress from collecting wood or buying charcoal and kerosene. She says with the bio-gas, her husband will not mind warming his own meal when she is not around, unlike previously when he would stay hungry until she returned from work.\r\n\r\nThe women will also be trained on how to practice organic farming, hence improving and increasing their crop yields as a way of ensuring food security.

Her son and three daughters are all married. Her son and his wife live with her and help out around the house. Kholiskhon has a high school education and grows crops to provide the main income for her family. She started farming 20 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS), and thanks to her hard work she now has two greenhouses where she plants early potatoes and cabbage for personal consumption and for sales. After the seeds sprout they become seedlings, and then slowly become ready for harvesting. She currently grows one variety of early cabbage in the greenhouse.

He is a father blessed with four children, two of whom are in school. To cover the daily cost of living, his entire family relies on the rice-farming business and fish catching. His wife's job is working in a local factory in the area. He has been with this business for 24 years, and it has returned him about 26,400 KHR per day. The main challenge for his business is the low crop yield caused by insects. To overcome his challenge, he applied for a new loan with VisionFund, a Kiva partner. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth-cycle loan for Ol with VisionFund. The past loan, which he has repaid back with success, has enabled him to improve his living conditions at a gradual pace.

is a 48-year-old married man who lives in Marneuli district. He has a wife, two sons and a daughter. His daughter gets a disability pension of 100 GEL from the local government, and his sons are learning at the university. Beglar's wife works at a school canteen and generates 500 GEL monthly. Beglar is unemployed at the moment. There is a high unemployment rate in the region, especially among people up to 40. \r\n \r\nAs the existing income is not enough for their five-member family and Beglar can\u2019t find any other job, he decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Beglar applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of 2,500 USD will help him to purchase a secondhand car. Beglar will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them around the city. He is a very enthusiastic and hard-working person.

Its members are the siblings Marcela and Fernando, and Rafael, who is Marcela\u2019s husband, but in the community everyone thinks that they three are siblings and therefore they decided to use this name for their bank. The members are always together, they considers themselves to be adventurers, talk to each other a lot and are helping one another. They live in a small and very quiet community where transportation used to be very scarce, but now there are more taxis.\r\n\r\nRafael has been married to Marcela for 19 years and together they have three children who are still at school. Rafael works selling chickens and clothes. This time he wants to invest the loan his business, but he is also considering investing in pi\u00f1atas for the holiday season. Rafael has been a merchant for 12 years. He previously lived with his family in another city, but due to some circumstances of life they moved away. In his old business he sold decorative items (costume jewelry, accessories, and make-up), but in the community where he lives now there was not much commercial potential. Rafael says: \u201cBefore, the ladies did not like make-up as they do now.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow Rafael sells chickens and clothes. He travels to other communities and sells in street markets or at important events everywhere in the area. Rafael does not have any problems with his business although sometimes he does not sell much. But his mood does not sink - on the contrary: he is very much interested in buying land to set up premises and also in selling in the squares in order to increase his income a bit and by this to secure the education of his children.\r\n\r\nMarce, as you know, will invest in her clothes business and Fernando in electrical appliances.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1423912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes for selling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Cruz Mextepec, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-12-26T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":4650,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6894.43},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7059.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7228.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7401.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":7578.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7759.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7944.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8134.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":534.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":547.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":560.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":573.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":601.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-27T06:51:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":651282,"name":"Nargis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nargis was born in the year 1981.

Sarim hopes the loan will enable her to continue growing her business and therefore increase her income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1500582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a plowing machine for the rice fields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Thom","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-12-26T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-26T19:29:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":651294,"name":"Ahlam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahlam, 37 years old, lives in Gaza at Beet Hanoon with her husband and four children.

age 26, is from the village of Abedati. She is divorced and has two children. Ana lives with her parents, retired grandmother, brother, uncle and aunt. The family runs an agricultural business to earn a living, growing maize, nuts and persimmons on their own plot of land. Anna dries the persimmons and sells the fruit at the local open market. She also breeds two milk cows and one calf. The women of the family make cheese to sell and for family consumption.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet increasing household expenses and to generate income for this large family's well being, Ana is requesting a loan. She will buy stocks of merchandise at wholesale prices to start a sales business.
