She is a widow and mother to her children. She, together with her children, manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMary Jane operates a rug making business. Her products are small rugs and larger doormats. She makes round rugs out of excess textile cloth she bought from a factory. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding down the highway in a speeding jeep. Mary Jane directly sells her products to her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 200 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Mary Jane is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMary Jane hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

They live in the south of the city which is where she has her two businesses.  One of her businesses is selling a variety of merchandise to fill orders made by her customers and the other is selling fried food and soft drinks.  She started her main business selling general merchandise more than 15 years ago, with a small amount of working capital, mainly selling clothing and footwear.  She then received a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo as a member of a community bank.  She used the loan to improve her income and start her new business.  Aideth has been working with this organization for 18 years and she has received 21 loans which she has invested wisely in her businesses. She has managed to increase her working capital and also her income.  Aideth is currently applying for a Kiva loan to buy fried products and soft drinks.  She will also buy school supplies, footwear and uniforms because her regular customers need them as students are starting their classes right now.

She is not afraid of work and is always happy seeing the positive side of life.  She is married to Arturo, who is 28 years old, and they have two children, Gino who is 17 and Ingrid who is 15.  Jessica lives beside her family in her own home and works hard daily since she wants to bring her family a better quality of life.  Jessica's job consists of selling food.  Early in the morning she goes to the market looking for the freshest ingredients and the most select items in order to bring forth a good product.  Once she returns home she prepares everything and goes out to sell to her clients who are very loyal since they know that her flavors are good and she treats her clients the best.  She does all of this work on her own at home.  She has been doing this work for one year.  Before that she worked selling groceries but that job was never-ending.  She likes what she does now since it permits her to have some free time.  It is going well for her as she is generating good income for her family.  Her plans for the future include opening a restaurant in her house, but she knows it is a process that will take a long time so for now she just wants to continue consolidating and growing a little bit the variety of dishes that she offers to her customers.  This will be her third credit with MFP, and she is hoping that with your help she will be able to reach her goals.

Since youth, he apprenticed with a master craftsman who made traditional chests. These chests are household objects and are used by Tajiks to store a bride's dowry, and also serve as a gift for a daughter when she gets married. After six months of training, Damir began manufacturing the chests on his own. In the beginning, things were difficult due to limited clientele. However, after working for one year, Damir acquired his own customers who regularly place orders for his chests. He makes a high-quality product and uses good wood, as well as a variety of ornaments and designs to decorate the chests' fronts. Using this loan, Damir would like to buy three cubic meters of lumber to increase

She is the mother of 7 children who she raised until they were grown-up. Now she only has one child at home, 14 year old Kaori. She has always lived alongside Armando, her husband, with whom she has worked to be able to offer a good education and upbringing to their children. Many years ago, Reyna had a good and prosperous business selling groceries. She had a very large and well-stocked store. Unfortunately, she had an illness that left her bedridden for a long time and so her business fell and she could no longer run it. As a result, 18 years ago, she decided to start a new business, one that she wouldn't have to work at all the time, but rather one that would enable her to rest. This is how she started to work in her new business that, at the start, she only did at the weekends. With time, she started working on alternating days. She works selling patasca (a soup from the mountains). In our city, there are many people from this part of out country and they very often go in search of dishes that are prepared the way that they like, with good seasoning and well made. She has been running this new business for 18 years and her husband helps her. \r\nThe business is going very well and she has good sales that bring her a good income. For the future, she'd like to grow her business and make a greater variety of dishes and so better serve her customers. This will be her fourth loan from MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support as she feels more sure that she can move her business forward. For her part, she promises once more to continue being good at making her repayments. She is very happy to work alongside the community bank members as they are all very united and responsible. \r\nShe will use the $950 she is requesting to buy ingredients and supplies to continue her business and to prepare a greater variety of dishes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1007572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients and supplies to make a greater variety of dishes.

But, as she is an ingenious woman, she buys animals such as sheep and pigs, which she fattens and sells in the market that takes place in her city on Sundays. She also sells her harvests, and in this way she obtains a larger income. \"I can't be without doing anything, I have to work on something,\" she mentions. For this reason she also knits wool sweaters with her own hands. This is going very well, and a number of people have placed orders with her. In addition, she works on government projects in her district, where they pay her a monthly salary. In this way she can offer everything necessary to her children. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.

I am a second year Bachelor of Business Information Technology (BBIT) student at Strathmore University. I am the first born in a family of four children consisting my single mother, three siblings and me. We all live in my grandparents\u2019 place. They own a small piece of land which sustains our large family. My mother has limited funds and is also supporting my younger sibling in high school. \n\nThe main challenge I have faced is lack of funds to continue with my education. I am applying for this loan to buy a laptop after facing a challenging time during my first two years of studies without a personal machine. I am a victim of submitting my projects after the deadline, since I have been depending on my friends' laptops even though they also have projects to work on. \n\nStrathmore has a great and appealing reputation countrywide. It was my dream university. I plan to use my laptop to do my projects and carry out research and class work. I will use it to do my assignments and I will also watch beneficial documentaries using it.

","en":"Burul is 35 years old, she is married and is raising four children. In 2000 while looking for a source of financial support for her family Burul started her business in field work and animal husbandry. She used a starting capital amount of 10,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle. Burul was able to develop her business with a monthly income of around 10,000 som. At this time her business has three milk cows, ten sheep and one horse as well as 1,04 hectares of arable land with clover which is used as a fodder for her livestock. With the goal to further develop her business Burul has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep for fattening. In the nearest future Burul plans to increase the headcount of cattle with the help of the income from the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1013414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bokombaevo village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T07:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T07:10:03Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":40364.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339077,"comment":null},{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40364.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459417,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T23:54:22Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395575,"name":"Robert Akambi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Robert Akambi est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 37 ans et vit au B\u00e9nin.

She often works from home, or when a customer wants her to go to their home, she does not hesitate to go.\r\n\r\nShe is doing very well in her work, and she likes it because she is having fun while making money. She has now increased her range and sells secondhand clothing as well, in different communities around the city. Every day Marli demonstrates that she is a woman who is not afraid of hard work and wants to progress. She has plans that in time she will have a place where she can serve her customers in comfort. This will be her seventh loan with MFP, and she is very happy at being offered this financial support to increase her working capital. She knows she must be very responsible, and above all very punctual. She is happy to belong to the communal bank, and sees them as very supportive. With the 1200 Soles requested, she will buy more merchandise to offer a greater range of innovative designs to customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1007557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T08:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T08:10:07Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":181.31},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":191.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":190.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":205.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":213.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":217.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.47},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":181.31,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":182.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386555,"comment":null},{"amount":136.43,"local_amount":363.81,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":366.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099680,"comment":null},{"amount":6.79,"local_amount":18.11,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":18.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713817,"comment":null},{"amount":77.09,"local_amount":205.57,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":206.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202710,"comment":null},{"amount":79.96,"local_amount":213.23,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":214.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098390,"comment":null},{"amount":81.74,"local_amount":217.97,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":219.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401184,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She lives in the house she inherited from her parents in the city of El Tambo, where she takes care of her three daughters.  For five years she has been active in the art of embroidery which she started after a friend taught her.  Now she embroiders at home where she can comfortably take care of the house and attend to her children.  She also grows alfalfa which she sells wholesale.  She has no fixed work schedule but is constantly embroidering because the complexity of the work and thickness of the design on the fabric means it takes up to a month to make a typical garment admired by her customers which they buy and pay for in cash.  The most profitable season for business is during the local holiday season called the festival of Saint James which is widely celebrated in the region.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to increase her production of embroidered skirts and hire people to help with production.  She belongs to the communal bank \"Mujeres Victorianas\" and this is her sixth loan through MFP.  She is very happy with the financial support and always has been responsible in her payments.  She enjoys being part of the communal bank because all the members are responsible, supportive people.  \r\n\r\nIf Victoria receives your support she will use the loan to buy thread and fabric for her embroidery products.

The couple have three children who they care for in their own home in the town of Yacuraquina.\r\n\r\nJulia started working as a very good farmer but she always dreamed of being a saleswoman and having her own business.  The farm work was tiring and sometimes she suffered many losses as the bad weather would make her lose crops.  For this reason, she saved up the money she needed to open a business buying and selling clothing in different sizes, colors and price-ranges.  She sells these products in her own village.  During the week, she travels to a nearby city where she buys fashionable clothing and takes it back to her village.  Owing to the distance, this is not an easy journey to make and there are no clothing stores in her village.  This means that her business does very well.  Julia's husband works providing a public transport service in a motorcycle taxi that he acquired a short time ago.  During the day he transports local people from Pampas to different places in the area.\r\n\r\nNow Julia would like to increase her capital and buy new clothing for her business. This will her first loan from MFP and she is very happy to have financial support.  She has always shown herself to be responsible in making her payments.

He is a single man who is devoted to his family.  Over the years he managed to acquire a car which he uses to provide a public transport service, covering the routes between Hualahoyo and the city center.  He carries out his work from Monday to Saturday.  On Sundays he rests after a week of hard work.  He says that he makes more profits during the school term because his customers are mainly school children.  Now that they are on vacation, he doesn't make so much profit.  He is keenly waiting for the school year to start again.  \"I like to care for my nieces and nephews as if they were my own children\", he says.  For this reason, he would like to have a stable job in the future with social benefits and also a pension later down the line.  With this security, he would like to start building his own home and form a family.  He will take the first step by acquiring a new driver's license which he needs to work for a well-known mine in his town.\r\n\r\nThis is Idilio's first loan from MFP.  He is very happy to have financial support and he has always shown himself to be responsible in meeting his payments.  He enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.

Rolando says that he enjoys living in the countryside and, although he does not have a family, he really enjoys caring for his father who he loves. \r\n\r\nThis will be Rolando's third loan from MFP and he is very hopeful that he will receive your cooperation which will help him to continue achieving his goals.  For his part, he pledges once again to make his repayments on time.  He enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.  With your support, Rolando will invest the money he has requested in buying nutritionally-balanced feed for his animals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1007635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy nutritionally-balanced feed for his animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rolando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":233.02},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":253.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":254.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":267.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":270.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":288.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":293.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":304.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":317.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":327.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":339.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":349.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":88.21,"local_amount":233.02,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":236.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386557,"comment":null},{"amount":92.66,"local_amount":244.76,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":248.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099693,"comment":null},{"amount":99.81,"local_amount":263.65,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":267.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713828,"comment":null},{"amount":101.06,"local_amount":266.94,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":271.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202722,"comment":null},{"amount":102.48,"local_amount":270.7,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":275.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098403,"comment":null},{"amount":109.29,"local_amount":288.7,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":293.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401196,"comment":null},{"amount":111.26,"local_amount":293.89,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":298.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455590,"comment":null},{"amount":115.29,"local_amount":304.53,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":309.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451362,"comment":null},{"amount":504.94,"local_amount":1333.81,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1355.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446536,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T23:59:45Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395361,"name":"Khalig","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khaliq is engaged in agriculture.

She is married to Carlos who is always at her side to work with her and get a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nLili sells meals. Early in the morning she goes to the nearest market\u2014and sometimes straight to the wholesale market\u2014and buys the freshest vegetables and the healthiest meat for her dishes. Once at home, she cleans the vegetables and grinds the meat, seasons the ingredients and keeps an eye on the food, while her secret condiments penetrate the meat and give it its delicious taste, until the plates are ready to cook. As soon as the cooking is under way, Lili writes small notices with the name of the dishes she is about to offer during the day. She has been in this business for the past twelve years and is working with her husband, although he suffers a bit from declining health and cannot support his wife as much as she would like him to do. Lili really likes what she does, because it gives her a better financial situation and allows her to do the various household chores. She expects her business to continue its growth and would like to have better premises, where she could serve her customers more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma.

Caman\u00e1 is known for its beautiful beaches, warm temperature and the generosity of its inhabitants. She finished high school and wanted to study cosmetology, but didn\u2019t. Like all good Peruvians, she likes typical Peruvian food; one of her favorites is Parrillada (barbecued meat). Veronica is the mother of 2 children, aged 10 and 12, who are in school. She loves them very much and they are her reason to be and to continue getting ahead.    \r\n\r\nWith much effort and dedication, she was able to save some money and she now has a business selling tamales and humitas, both made with milled corn, seasoning made from spices, and pork, among other ingredients. Her seasoning is so good that the majority of her clients come back for more.

They live comfortably together in their own house that they worked very hard to buy.

Daysi feels her business is sufficiently profitable because it provides healthy profits and a busy location.  She decided to start her business because she had an accident on the river in which she lost the boat she used for her transportation service and she needed to have income to support the family.  So now, given the good results she's getting, she wants to keep and maintain her business.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Daysi's second loan with MFP.  She's very glad to know that she'll get financial support because it will make her feel secure in moving ahead with her business.  She plans to invest the 1500 soles in ingredients for meals.  Prices are going up so she'll look for better prices to increase  profit margin.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1007668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients and supplies for food preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daysi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":121.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":132.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":141.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":157.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":177.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.64,"local_amount":121.66,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":125.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386561,"comment":null},{"amount":51.24,"local_amount":133.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":137.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099698,"comment":null},{"amount":50.98,"local_amount":132.99,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:17Z","rounded_local_amount":136.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713833,"comment":null},{"amount":54.15,"local_amount":141.27,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":145.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202727,"comment":null},{"amount":55.31,"local_amount":144.28,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":148.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401199,"comment":null},{"amount":119.59,"local_amount":311.98,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":321.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455594,"comment":null},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":72.51,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":74.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451365,"comment":null},{"amount":35.25,"local_amount":91.96,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":94.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446538,"comment":null},{"amount":65.84,"local_amount":171.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":176.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052575,"comment":null},{"amount":68.2,"local_amount":177.93,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":183.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189144,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T23:38:31Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395376,"name":"Ruslan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruslan is 27 years old and he is married.

She decided to help one of her aunts with her business until she could raise enough money to continue her education. After some years she raised some capital, but after consulting her aunt about her plight, she advised her to establish her own business instead of going back to school. Since she had some business experience, she decided to take her aunt's advice and open her own shop. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 1,500,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL to buy four cartons of assorted children\u2019s slippers (450,000 SLL), three cartons of ladies' sandals (650,000 SLL), and two cartons of ladies' slippers (550,000 SLL). The balance of the loan will be used for transportation. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 700,000 SLL.

","en":"Jamiyla is 35 years old, married and raising five school-age children.  In search of a financial source, she started her own business in animal husbandry.  Thanks to her persistent work, Jamiyla's business currently has two dairy cows and forty sheep, which allows her to earn about 2,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and meat products.  She also grows beans on 0.76 hectares of irrigated land, which allows her to have an income during the season as well.  In order to further develop her business, Jamiyla requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows.

He wants to have a shoemaking business.  He lives with Narjil, a housewife and the mother of their three children: Dais, 18, Dayana, 15, and Luz, 14.  Together they live in the comfort of their own home, which they managed to buy through mutual support. \r\n\r\nThe work Miguel does is shoe repair, a job he learned by taking classes and training workshops while he was working in a shoemaking business in another city.  He does his work in a small rented space at the entrance to a shoe store, where he gives his customers quick and friendly service and is very much in demand.  He began three years ago with his own capital, buying a sewing machine for shoemaking, and has worked alone up to the present.  He considers his business quite profitable because of the profits it yields him.  He also saw the opportunity to generate income for himself, because this service was scarce in that area.\r\n\r\nBefore starting his business he had financial problems because he was unemployed.  Besides liking the work, he looked for alternatives to be able to support his family.  Consequently, seeing the profits and the good results he is having now, he wants to continue his business and in the future open a shoemaking workshop.\r\n\r\nThis will be his second loan with the MFP institution, for which he hopes for your collaboration so he can continue with his goals.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 3000 PEN he will invest in buying materials to repair shoes, such as glue, thread, and others, as well as shoemaking materials such as soles, leather, and others.  He will look for low prices for buying in quantity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1007651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy soles, leather, thread, and glue.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":249.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":268.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":272.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":284.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":290.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":307.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":314.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":325.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":338.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":348.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.86},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.63,"local_amount":249.69,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":251.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386559,"comment":null},{"amount":100.86,"local_amount":268.96,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":270.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099695,"comment":null},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":272.21,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":274.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713830,"comment":null},{"amount":106.79,"local_amount":284.77,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":286.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202724,"comment":null},{"amount":721.64,"local_amount":1924.37,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1937.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T00:16:13Z","paid_date":"2013-04-19T09:21:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393581,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Virginia  se dedica a el comercio de art\u00edculos del hogar (electrodom\u00e9sticos, sabanas, copas, focos y otras mercader\u00edas) hace diez a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad, ofrece sus productos a distintos sectores, ya sea oficina e incluso en los mercados otorgando sus productos a cr\u00e9dito como al contado, los cuales los compra en la ciudad de Oruro y posteriormente entrega la mercader\u00eda a clientes que le hacen pedido en la ciudad de Cochabamba, vive actualmente con su esposo en domicilio de su propiedad, solicita el cr\u00e9dito para compra de mercader\u00eda como electrodom\u00e9sticos y sabanas ya que le hicieron un pedido importante y as\u00ed de esta manera poder incrementar su capital de trabajo y de esta manera  incrementar sus ventas y obtener mas ganancias, la Sra.

","en":"Kaiyrkul is 58 years old, married and raising two grandsons. Her family's primary business is fattening up and reselling livestock.  This business, started in 1993 with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS), today yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  Currently, Kaiyrkul's business has two dairy cows, five sheep and one horse.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Kaiyrkul requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy sheep. This would allow her to expand her business and increase livestock headcount; thus, making the best capital investment, in her

When she took her first steps in business, she focused on selling underwear.  She was studying at the time and it was easier for her to do this.  When she got married in 1980 her husband, who had a lot of experience (because he used to work in a store,) shared his knowledge with her and encouraged her to start her own business.  She gradually bought sheets and toiletries which she sold to her first customers who were neighbors.  She did very well.  With her savings, she acquired display cabinets one by one and started to diversify her product range until she turned the business into what it is today a 'general store' where, in addition to a variety of merchandise, she also sells food, provisions, soft drinks, etc.  Right now, her wish is to continue growing her business and this is why she has requested a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use it to buy school supplies and food products in larger quantities, making the most of the fact that it is the first school term of the year which is a good time to sell these products.  Traditionally she has done very well at this.  Cecilia's goal is to continue growing her business and to promote it further with adverts via the latest technology.  With this business and both Cecilia and her husband's work, they have managed to support their two children who are now 27 and 28 years old."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1008202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

Together with her husband, she started to grow vegetables 20 years ago.  At first, they planted tomatoes, radishes and other vegetables in the open ground.  Then, they started to cover the ground with plastic by building small greenhouses.  Due to the changes in prices and seasons (early vegetables are more profitable to sell), they now have the need to build a large greenhouse, but do not have their own means to do so.  Olga is requesting a loan in the sum of 10,000 hryvnia to install a large greenhouse for tomatoes.

Two years ago her father began an internet caf\u00e9 business which he later gave to her so that she could earn her own income, pay for her university education, and become more independent. Her business has gotten ahead because she meets the virtual communication needs of her community since very few people have computers or technological means which today are absolutely necessary for everyone. For that reason, everyone from students to housewives come to this business and pay for the services that Chadya offers, like internet work, fun games, special offers, communication through social networks, etc. Her goal is to expand and in the future have a branch in another neighborhood of the city that also needs it.

Tolibjon is involved in making furniture and various national tables.  He has a large order to make national tables, which are small and low.  Many use this type of table in the winter to heat up a room by covering it with a blanket.  Tolibjon's wife stays home and raises their child.

She's married to 40-year-old Gerson, with whom she has four underage children - Paulo, aged 15, Liz, aged 10, Jenifer, aged 7, and the youngest, Jazmin, aged 3. She works very hard because she wishes to improve their living conditions. They live together in a house they own, where they share the good things and face the difficulties that come their way. Elda's work is selling regional food. Every day she goes out to the sidewalk in front of her home and sets up the tables, chairs and all the supplies she needs in order to start selling. Every day she gets a lot of customers who come searching for the delicious dishes she prepares with her own hands which are very skilled at seasoning. The most important thing is that she offers all kinds and varieties of dishes, from the most common to the most rare ones. Her customers always find what they search for and leave satisfied, because she always greets them all with special service and a beautiful smile. She has been in this line of work for three years and during this time she learned that a well-treated customer is one who will come back often.\r\nShe remembers when she got her start in this business. Because they had a low income, she decided to start this business without neglecting her home and, most of all, her children. She currently has many plans, but what she wants for now is to consolidate her business and to begin expanding it in the future. This will be her fifth loan with MFP. She's very glad to know she will have financial support, because this way she will feel more confident as she moves forward with her work. Besides, she enjoys being a part of her communal bank, since all of the members are responsible and very supportive people. With the requested amount of 3.000 soles, she will purchase ingredients so that she can continue preparing her various food dishes. Also, she will invest part of it in getting new kitchenware and providing more security for her venue."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1007546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase food making supplies and to renew her kitchenware.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":453.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":478.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":476.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":513.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":532.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":545.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":169.94,"local_amount":453.18,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":456.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386553,"comment":null},{"amount":179.32,"local_amount":478.19,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":481.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099678,"comment":null},{"amount":143.23,"local_amount":381.95,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":384.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713816,"comment":null},{"amount":228.08,"local_amount":608.2,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":612.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202709,"comment":null},{"amount":199.86,"local_amount":532.96,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098389,"comment":null},{"amount":28.85,"local_amount":76.94,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":77.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401183,"comment":null},{"amount":175.72,"local_amount":468.58,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":471.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869237,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T19:32:32Z","paid_date":"2013-04-19T09:21:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396043,"name":"Akouemevo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe AKOUEMEVO est form\u00e9 de trois personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame quartier.

Her main clientele are the many employees at the company where her daughter works, who have begun to trust, little by little, in her ability to make delicious meals. Ferlina employs someone to help transport the meals, while she is in full production. The results of her business present a level of sales that allow her to cover her operating costs. Her income is in cash, though she has some monies still owed to her because although she generally accepts only cash, some of her most loyal clients pay by credit. The toughest part is getting enough work capital together to improve her process, that\u2019s why she is requesting her 1st Kiva loan through the Maria Santo Domingo Foundation. With this loan, she will buy an industrial stove, kitchen utensils and a large volume of basic ingredients. This is an exciting investment because she plans on buying product in large volume and by cash, which will lower her production costs.

This group is located in Los Alcarrizos, a dusty urban area where there are many free trade zones and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her 5 children.  Being a single mother, her most difficult challenge has been to raise her children and educate them.  Now some are grown and help her to take care of the younger ones. \r\n\r\nAdriana is excited to be taking out her 7th loan with Esperanza, after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling miscellaneous products, like used clothes, cartons of eggs and boiled beans. She started with a very small business 7 years ago, where she just sold boiled beans.  Then, reinvesting her profits, she added eggs and clothes. Now she is very proud to sell many different products, and she will invest this loan to increase her inventory. She thanks you all for your support.
