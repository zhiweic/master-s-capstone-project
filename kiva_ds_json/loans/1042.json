One of Toledo\u2019s most beautiful spots, Blue Creek is surrounded by mountains and rests atop of an underground water cave of over 5 miles. The few tourists that pass by Toledo most often pay a visit to Blue Creek to swim down the cave and see its numerous waterfalls. \n\nSilvano and Delfina have brought up six children, the youngest of whom is now 20. All of them have professional jobs in town whether it is in teaching, tourism or civil service. Delfina makes crafts such as bracelets and necklaces to sell to passerby tourists, and the family has opened their doors for homestays. Besides growing cacao, Silvano is also a medicinal healer of the Q\u2019eqhci\u2019 tradition. He cultivates over an acre of medicinal plants he uses in healing practices and opens for medicinal trail tours. \n\nThe family is requesting the loan in order to double the capacity of the 2 acre and 800-plant cacao farm. Silvano says he is ready to be able to enjoy his house and farm, whereas now he still has to move around considerably for his tourism-linked activities. \u201cI enjoy everything about being a farmer, I like to work,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao, confessing that he\u2019s also looking forward to the days he gets to just sit around the farm. The more challenging part of cacao farming for Silvano are the many critters after the plant \u2013 if not the rodents chewing on the roots, you have to worry about leaf-cutter ants and birds as well as squirrels that often get to the fruit before farmers do. \n\nThe loan will be used to set up an on-farm nursery and raise seedlings for the said expansion. Seedlings are cacao trees grown in bags for at least six months to get them ready for transplanting in the ground. Once planted, cacao trees take three to five years to start producing depending on the breed and whether the trees are grafted. Grafting is the process of inserting the tissue of one seedling into another and results in more productive trees that start yielding pods sooner than their non-grafted counterparts. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":274.83,"image":{"id":1282495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Set up nursery to expand cacao farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Blue Creek","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T23:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T23:40:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.88,"local_amount":57,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":61.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863450,"comment":null},{"amount":27.1,"local_amount":50.03,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098938,"comment":null},{"amount":27.11,"local_amount":50.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":54.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971153,"comment":null},{"amount":27.11,"local_amount":50.04,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":54.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751678,"comment":null},{"amount":27.1,"local_amount":50.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":54.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993419,"comment":null},{"amount":27.11,"local_amount":50.04,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":54.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255588,"comment":null},{"amount":27.1,"local_amount":50.03,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":54.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136429,"comment":null},{"amount":27.11,"local_amount":50.04,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:17Z","rounded_local_amount":54.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900646,"comment":null},{"amount":27.1,"local_amount":50.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":54.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088530,"comment":null},{"amount":27.11,"local_amount":50.04,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":54.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202033,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-24T01:02:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":518496,"name":"Remus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remus is a forty-one-year-old farmer who lives in Chasimba.

ambitious young woman. She is 21 years old, single, and lives with her parents and sister. Munira would have liked very much to enroll in university after graduating from high school, but her parents had no money to pay her tuition. Now, she has decided to start her own livestock business and achieve success in this endeavour. To this end, Munira took the course \"Succeed\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained her graduation certificate. This course gave her a lot of useful information.

Previously, he and his wife worked at a poultry farm as simple labourers. However, the farm closed and many people were laid off, including Halimjon. At the time, he was already engaged in raising cattle at home and selling his animals at a market. However, having lost his employment, he decided to travel to Russia to find work there, while his wife and son continued to look after the animals. Unfortunately, Halimjon was unable to find good employment opportunities abroad, and was forced to return to his home village.\r\n\r\nHalimjon has decided to invest all his efforts in his cattle business, since it is the only activity that earns him an income. Recently, he discovered that MDO Arvand is in a partnership with Kiva, and that he can obtain a Kiva loan and realize his plans. Halimjon applied for a loan, which he will use to purchase cattle and expand the size of his herd. He thanks Kiva for their financial support and assistance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":880.57,"image":{"id":1280437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She is 30 years and she is not yet married or a mother.  Izzatoy has been interested in sewing and tailoring women's clothing from an early age.  She studied under a seamstress sewing women's clothes a few years ago.  Now she is already experienced as a seamstress and she is fable to start her own business and attracting clients.  In order to start her business and receive an income it was necessary for Izzatoy to enroll in the \"Get Ahead\" course offered by the Association of Businesswomen.  After completing the course, she received a certificate and she is now fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She wants to start her business offering sewing services, as she has experience in that line of work.

is a 41-year-old married woman from Baclayon, Bohol, Philippines. She has four children. Sabiniana is engaged in a food-vending business. She makes torta, a sponge cake made with flour, egg yolks, milk, and salt, which is similar to cupcakes. Sabiniana wants to expand her business but lacks the financial resources to do so.

Due to the constant traveling and taxi service payments, he needs an automobile which runs on natural gas. Therefore, he is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 MNT to purchase an automobile.

She is married to Elyas, who is a vendor, and a mother to their children. Together with her husband, Saipa manages her household while operating her \"ukay-ukay\" business. She works hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. Saipa  sells used clothing that is presented stacked up on a table or mat, although special clothing is displayed in hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls because they are much cheaper than brand new clothes sold in malls. Since Saipa's stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes and she earns a minimum of 300 PHP each day. \r\n\r\nSaipa is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan to buy additional stock of used-but-quality shirts, shorts, blouses, and pants to expand her business. Customers are attracted to \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls as they have lots of clothes to choose from. Saipa plans to add more pants or jeans, used bags, and footwear. She plans to use the profits from her loan to meet customer demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, Saipa will expand her business and boost her income.\r\n\r\nSaipa hopes her business will grow and she will have her own stall. She dreams that her children will finish their studies and have a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the studying the word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1282727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy additional stock of used-but-quality shirts, shorts, blouses, and pants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-01-24T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-23T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484710,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4064.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037219,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5081.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781737,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4064.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488629,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894267,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-24T17:11:47Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520829,"name":"Norberto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norberto is married and has seven children.

He lives in the Marneuli district with his wife and son. Vugar owns a bakery, which is stopped. Vugar has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but he hasn't had any success. He wants to re-start his own bakery, but his loan requests have always been rejected in the past because of his lack of experience, which is usually required by local credit providers. Vugar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Vugar will purchase a dough breaker and will knead dough.

They formed a family with seven children who are all independent now.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuisa has worked for 18 years making silver items like earrings, necklaces, bells, bracelets, etc.  Luisa commented: \u201cI decided to help my husband make his items because my children were very little and expenses were too high for my husband to cover.\u201d  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn this occasion she\u2019s asking the institution for a loan to buy silver, stones, jewelry boxes and welding goggles.  She relates that the first thing they do is buy white silver that they melt down to then calibrate the numbers they or their customers require and then make the items.  Luisa comments that in order to make a bell, for example, it takes about a week because it requires several types of arrangements.  She relates that in the month of December she was able to sell three bells to one of Banamex Bank\u2019s foundations.  Luisa says that she likes her activity very much but the only problem is her eyesight that makes it more difficult each time to make a good piece.  She wouldn't want to stop making crafts and would also like her children to learn how to make this type of craft in order to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group members are very happy and grateful to the institution and to KIVA because they will be able to invest in their businesses.

He lives in a small village and has a wife and one child. His wife takes care of the family's household. Since 2004, Maruf has been engaged in buying and selling cattle, which he keeps at home. He is a painter by trade, but his employment income is not sufficient even for basic subsistence. For this reason, Maruf also raises cattle and tries to develop this business.\r\n\r\nPresently, Maruf has run out of animal fodder and has no funds to purchase more. He plans to use this loan to buy several bags of animal feed. He would like to fatten the animals until spring and then sell them at a profit.

She is 23 years old, she is not married and lives with her parents.  For now she does not want to get married, she wants to work and be independent.\r\n\r\nMahina is a hairdresser by profession.  She has been in this business for around 3 years.  She has a salon that she rents.  The salon is far from her home and it is very difficult for her to get there on foot because the minibus does not go there.  Mahina successfully finished a driving course several years ago and got her license.  Having discussed it with her parents she decided to buy an inexpensive car.  \r\n\r\nMahina plans to use the loan to buy a car and thanks KIVA in advance for its help and support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1278178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

grows a variety of agricultural crops. He has ten hectares of land where he mostly grows onions and wheat. In addition, he grows carrots, potatoes and feed crops. Last year's harvest was a success and he was pleased that he successfully sold everything. But he had difficulty with transporting the harvest because he did not have a car.  He has been saving up but still does not have enough money. He therefore appealed to Arvand for financial support. Saydullo now wants to re-plant the seeds and hopes that this year will bring a harvest as good as last year's. He has saved a little money to buy a car but it is not enough; therefore, he wants to take out a loan to supplement his savings and buy an inexpensive automobile. \r\n\r\nSaydullo is very thankful to KIVA for their financial support and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1278846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to buy a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-01-24T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-23T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saydullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":326.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":333.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":340.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":340.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325.1,"local_amount":325.1,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":325.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136601,"comment":null},{"amount":332.87,"local_amount":332.87,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":332.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900798,"comment":null},{"amount":342.03,"local_amount":342.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":342.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429549988,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-28T06:58:07Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520922,"name":"Jorissa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jorissa, 28, is married with two children and lives in Poblacion, Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay.\r\nJorissa has owned a small piggery to earn a living for three years.

Ahora convive con su pareja; un esforzado agricultor, su nombre es Estenio de 54 a\u00f1os que trabaja d\u00eda a d\u00eda en las tierras sin importar la lluvia o el ardiente sol. Mar\u00eda y su pareja tienen un hijo a quien esperan darle lo necesario para que culmine sus estudios satisfactoriamente. Viven en unidad familiar en la Parroquia Puerto Lim\u00f3n del cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo el puerto de intercambio comercial entre las Regiones Costa y Sierra del Ecuador, un sector que fue habitado por una comunidad ts\u00e1chila y tiene varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos. Adem\u00e1s los habitantes de esta parroquia en su gran mayor\u00eda, se dedican a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda. Cada familia de esta zona emprende cada d\u00eda en lo que su tierra ofrece para salir adelante y no desmayar.\nMar\u00eda Isabel en vista de la escasez de oportunidades en el sector privado por su falta de instrucci\u00f3n, se vio en la necesidad de emprender un negocio que consiste en venta de golosinas y comida r\u00e1pida en el bar de un colegio ubicado en la ciudad. Fue desde hace dos a\u00f1os que Mar\u00eda comenz\u00f3 con este reto y ha crecido y ha podido aportar con los gastos de su hogar que en un inicio solo eran cubiertos por su esposo. Ella invierte en esta actividad 8 horas al d\u00eda y luego contin\u00faa con las labores de su hogar que no puede dejarlas de lado. Ahora requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 algunos productos que le permitan surtir su negocio, pero adem\u00e1s comprar\u00e1 un horno tostador con el cual podr\u00e1 preparar alimentos extras que son solicitados por sus j\u00f3venes y adolescentes clientes quienes tienen un paladar exigente al momento de su recreo o tiempo libre. Mar\u00eda espera que sus ingresos mejoren y por ende su calidad de vida. Cuando le preguntamos a ella por qu\u00e9 conf\u00eda en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes le otorgan el cr\u00e9dito, ella respondi\u00f3 que es una entidad que tiene el distintivo de apoyar a gente emprendedora del sector rural, brind\u00e1ndoles apoyo y agilidad sin mayores obst\u00e1culos para cumplir sus sue\u00f1os. Mar\u00eda Isabel env\u00eda saludos a todas las personas alrededor del mundo que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva son c\u00f3mplices de su sue\u00f1o de superaci\u00f3n.","en":"Mar\u00eda Isabel is a 51-year-old woman. Throughout her life she has faced tough obstacles, and her financial situation hasn't always been the best. That's why she completed elementary school and soon thereafter started helping with household chores in order to support herself and fulfill the needs of everyone in the household. She currently lives with her partner - a hardworking farmer named Estenio who's 54 years old and works everyday on the farm, regardless of the rain or the burning sun. Mar\u00eda and her partner have a son and they hope to provide him with what he needs in order to successfully complete his studies. They live in their family home in the parish of Puerto Lim\u00f3n of the canton of Santo Domingo. It's a commercial gateway between the coast and the mountains of Ecuador, an area inhabited by a Ts\u00e1chila community with several tourist attractions. Most of the people who live in this parish work in agriculture and cattle raising. Each family in this area labors everyday on the fruits of their land in order to get ahead and not falter.\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel was faced with poor job opportunities in the private sector due to her lack of education. That's why she felt the need to establish a business consisting of selling snacks and fast food in a bar located in a local school. Mar\u00eda took on this challenge two years ago, and she has grown and has been able to afford her household expenses which her husband used to pay for alone. She works on this business 8 hours a day and afterwards she keeps on doing household chores she can't neglect. She currently requests a loan which she'll use to purchase some merchandise that allows her to stock up her business. Aside from that, she'll purchase a rotisserie with which she'll be able to prepare additional foods that her customers request. Her young and teenage customers have a demanding taste during their recess or free time. Mar\u00eda hopes to improve her profits and therefore her quality of life. When asked about why she trusts Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa - which provides the loan - she answers that it's an institution who has the distinctive trait of supporting enterprising people of rural areas by providing them with support and readiness without further obstacles to achieve their dreams. Mar\u00eda Isabel sends her greetings to all the people around the world who by using Kiva become part of her dream to overcome."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975.1,"image":{"id":1283168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Ahora su hijo es un adulto independiente y Luis vive solo  en la  Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, un lugar hist\u00f3rico de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar.

He grew up in the countryside with his mother who, with great effort, was able to provide Luis with a primary school education. Getting back on his feet after the loss of his wife was very tough for him. However, he did not give up and struggled on for his son who had lost his mother. Now his son is an independent adult and Luis lives alone in the parish of R\u00edo Verde, an area full of history. \r\n\r\nThe parish is located in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province in Ecuador, which has sustained high growth over the past number of years. The most attractive and interesting feature of Santo Domingo city is its delicious fruit and the local gastronomy. The level of business carried out here is also considerable as it has become an inland hub for commercial activity between the country\u2019s mountain and coastal regions. Furthermore, its many tourist attractions and warm climate make it a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists. For this reason, most of the city\u2019s inhabitants are involved in some form of commercial activity or service for local residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, with the experience he acquired in other jobs, Luis decided to become an independent micro-entrepreneur. He sells cement blocks which are used for residential construction. He works all day in this business, mixing cement and preparing the materials. Now he needs a loan to buy raw materials in cash and wholesale in order to increase his sales. This will provide him with income to improve his quality of life. \r\n\r\nWhen asked how he found Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in order to request the loan that he needs, Luis replied that it was thanks to the recommendation of a friend who was very satisfied with the service, advise and flexibility and trust that he had received.

Nuriya's children are studying in Bishkek's University.  Nuriya is a very kind and reliable person.  Nuriya works as a teacher in a preschool.  As a source of income for her family, Nuriya raises livestock, having started this business in 2003.  Thanks to Nuriya's hard work, her business started with a sum of 3,000 KGS allows her to have an income of 12,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk.  Today, Nuriya's household has 3 dairy cows.  In order to further grow her business, Nuriya turned to \"Bai-Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase cows to increase the milk amount.  Nuriya plans to invest the profits resulting from the loan into her children's education.  With time they will marry off their son and daughter.

Her business goal is to expand her business within 5 years. She hopes that in the future, she will employ youth in her business. This is her second loan with SMEP DTM. Previously, she took a loan of KES 20,000 which she managed to pay successfully."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":479.21,"image":{"id":1282955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She has become involved in animal husbandry, which is now the main source of income for her family.  \r\n\r\nNasira started in this business in 1998 with an initial capital of 10,000 som (KGS) and she has managed to expand her activity.  She is currently doing well: she owns some dairy cows, bulls and young oxen, some smaller livestock and a horse.

After she was married, her husband, a businessman, helped her establish a business of her own. Working seven days a week and ten hours a day, she earns about 2,100,000 SLL every month. Juma would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Juma requires the loan to buy peanuts for sale. This loan will help her business to grow and generate more profit. In the future, Juma plans to build a shop and provide a quality education for her youngest child. She describes herself as a hard-working woman. Juma hopes you will continue to fund her business, and she thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1283144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more peanuts to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2013-01-25T12:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-24T12:10:01Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":635924.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347011614,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":635924.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355753891,"comment":null},{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":635924.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364457900,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":635924.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372861960,"comment":null},{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":635924.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381630579,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":635924.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390494403,"comment":null},{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":635924.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399742605,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":635924.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410012781,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-26T16:50:28Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T09:48:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":521045,"name":"Robinah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Robinah is married with four children, and all of her children go to school.

She also sells different vegetables. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php10,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nMenchie wants to see her business growing and expanding. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Gulzat is forty-four, unmarried, and has one grown daughter.  As the family's breadwinner, she began earning her living in livestock.  After starting out with 20,000KGS in 2005, the farm now brings in nearly 12,000KGS per month from milk products and resale of livestock.  Thanks to her own tenacity, Gulzat's farm is well-developed.  She has turned to Bai Tushum for a loan of 60,000KGS so she can further develop the business by purchasing feed for her sheep.  She plans to put money into growing the business by getting more head of livestock.  Her future plans include building a

","en":"Chynarkul is 51 years old. She has raised 5 children, all of whom are now grown-up, and only her youngest son continues to live with his parents and help his mother. As the main source of income for her family, Chynarkul has been farming and raising livestock for the past 30 years, having started this business practically from zero. Thanks to her hard work, Chynarkul's herd currently includes 2 dairy cows and 4 sheep and goats, and her business's monthly profits amount to approximately 20,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nChynarkul needs to develop her business and increase her profits. With this in mind, she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 85,000 som (KGS) to buy additional cows in order to increase her income from sales of milk and dairy products. Chynarkul plans to invest her profits from this loan into further development of her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1629,"image":{"id":1282067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Mamajan village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-01-25T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-24T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chynarkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":85000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":6115},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6466},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6436},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6654},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6769},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6985},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7120},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7301},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7513},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":7679},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":7887},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":8075}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.93},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.49,"local_amount":6115,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:02:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6164.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012539,"comment":null},{"amount":136.93,"local_amount":6466,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6517.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754894,"comment":null},{"amount":136.29,"local_amount":6436,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6487.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458912,"comment":null},{"amount":140.91,"local_amount":6654,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6707.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863050,"comment":null},{"amount":143.34,"local_amount":6769,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-24T08:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6823.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631579,"comment":null},{"amount":147.92,"local_amount":6985,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7041.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495468,"comment":null},{"amount":150.78,"local_amount":7120,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7177.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743703,"comment":null},{"amount":154.61,"local_amount":7301,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7359.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013920,"comment":null},{"amount":159.1,"local_amount":7513,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7573.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776996,"comment":null},{"amount":162.61,"local_amount":7679,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7740.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426771,"comment":null},{"amount":167.02,"local_amount":7887,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":7950.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942419,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-26T18:05:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":521151,"name":"Norlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norlita is 51 years old and married with 10 children.

Over the last ten years he started a livestock business with 8,000KGS.

A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1212334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To pay

is Mercedes, 46, and a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Neptalie, and a mother to their children. She and her husband manage their own household. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMercedes oversees their tricycle transportation business. They have one tricycle that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. In her business the regular customers are the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts, accessories and also for the maintenance of their motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMercedes dreams of being able to give her family a good life and hopes to give her children and grandchildren a good and quality education through all her hard work in her business.

He has been doing this for a long time and this is how he earns an honest living. He is a very responsible man, honest and dedicated to his work. He is well known among his neighbours who say good things about both his work and his character.

is Rose, 29, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. Single, she lives with her parents and helps them manage their household. She is also helping in generating income for their family. They have had this business for seven years now, and it is continuously growing.\r\n\r\nRose operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells different vegetables. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nRose hopes to make her variety store a grocery store and dreams to become rich. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1283517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-01-25T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-24T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1353.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484728,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.02,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2709.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037237,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.98,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2708.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781755,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2707.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488645,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":677.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894281,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-25T19:22:54Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":521297,"name":"Mwanajabu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanajabu, 53 years old, is a divorced woman from Likoni.

He has also been able to educate his children and look after his family in a decent manner.\r\n\r\nHe now wants to buy more cows with the loan he is getting to increase milk production and earn more income. Thank you for the great services.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1283487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more cows to increase milk production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-01-25T17:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-24T17:30:12Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Augustine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":125624.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347362513,"comment":null},{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":125624.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589731,"comment":null},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":125624.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993691,"comment":null},{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":125624.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040396,"comment":null},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":125624.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831032,"comment":null},{"amount":515.62,"local_amount":1375000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1381864.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439862985,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-27T11:59:40Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:58:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":521305,"name":"Boniface","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Boniface is asking for a new loan to expand his existing business.

His wish to get ahead in life has always been great; he is responsible, honest, straightforward, hardworking and enterprising.\r\n\r\nDavid earns his living growing basic grains such as maize and beans. As well, when there is not much work on his farm, he takes on jobs as a day laborer. Farming has been his principal source of income for several years, and he has put in a lot of effort and dedication. He now wishes to buy basic agricultural supplies so that his crops aren\u2019t ruined. For this reason he has approached INTEGRAL to ask for a loan to buy manure, fertilizer, pesticides etc. He hopes that he will be granted a loan as he has good references and expects to pay back the
