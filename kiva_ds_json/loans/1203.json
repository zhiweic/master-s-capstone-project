This is her story: My name is Yanery and I am 22 years old. I live in the municipality of Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic, and come from a very low-income family. I am the second of nine siblings and the first one to attend university. I have always dreamed about becoming a doctor and imagined myself wearing a white and long robe. However, as I was growing up and looked around me, this dream seemed harder to achieve. My mother is a very hardworking woman, but did not have the resources to make it possible. She was a single mother and I never met my father, who left us when I was born. My mom had to get ahead by herself and I am grateful to God for her. She taught me to fight for what I want and to never give up. Thanks to these values, I was able to finish my secondary studies. It was not easy for me to go to school as I had to walk long distances with hot weather or sometimes rain. However, I knew what my goal was and I would fight to make my dream come true. I moved from my mother's house and lived with a friend of the family, which made it easier to attend classes. When I finished high-school I was both happy and sad. I was happy because I had moved one step forward and was closer to my dream of going to university, but I was sad because I was not able to be at the graduation party with the rest of my classmates or have photos taken, as my mother could not buy me a dress or pay for my graduation photo. \r\n\r\nI started working when I was very young, cleaning houses and taking care of kids. This is how I could attend university. I am currently studying my second year of Odontology, an area of Medicine that I really like, and my dream is to finish and to help many people. I have been able to cover tuition for these two years, but it is too hard now. I do not have a job right now, but still need to pay tuition for one semester, which is why I am requesting the loan. It would be a blessing to count on your help and to use my talent, knowledge and abilities to help people. I could put a smile on the faces of those that think there is no hope. \r\n\r\nI hope my story has moved you and that you will decide to bless me with your help.

She is one of the founding members of the organization, and is an active member of the loan committee in her community.  She was married at age 24 and has 9 children; four of her children have emigrated to the United States out of the need for a better life.  She works together with her husband in agriculture (growing corn, beans and sorghum).  She completed the fourth grade in her community.  She comes from a family of 4 siblings (three males and one female), whose parents always taught them to work hard in order to get ahead.  She lives in her house wth her husband and 5 of her 9 children. Three of her children are students at the basic education level in their community, one is studying nursing in the city, and the other helps her with the household work and in her tailor shop. In 1996 she went to a clothing factory in the city, where she learned to make pants and shirts for men and women.  This helped her, so that she now makes uniforms for the students in six schools in neighboring communities.  Her daughter and three other people help her with this activity.  For almost two years she has worked growing vegetables (planting cucumbers, tomatoes, chilies, broccoli and other things).  She learned this trade through training and technical assistance that she has received through various organizations that work in agriculture. For this activity she needs to travel to the closest city to buy seeds, which takes about 30 minutes by urban transport.  The loan she is requesting is to buy fertilizer to grow the vegetables, which will cost $250.00, and to pay $150.00 for laborers.  She makes some plant-based fungicides herself in the community. She will also buy manure to grow corn and beans for $400.00, and pay the laborers $200.00. With this investment she will obtain better harvests and ensure that her family is fed.

Gulsara has higher pedagogical education, and works at the village school as a Russian language teacher. Her husband is also a teacher. \r\n\r\nAs an additional income for her family, Gulsara works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulsara's persistent work, her farm currently has one dairy cow, four bulls and also a plot of land of 2.20 hectares. Here she grows peppers, beans and clover every year. The monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulsara turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to increase the number of livestock through purchasing two heads of cattle.

He is 45 years old and married with five children who are 15, 18, 20, 25, and 27 years old. Three of his children are attending grade school, one is in the university, and one is attending vocational school. Among his children, only four live at home and the two oldest ones are working while attending school.\r\n\r\nMarcus has obtained a BSC in Engineering. His wife is not working. Marcus explains how he started this business with money that he got from a contract. Due to his career, he hired someone to work in his shop where he sells lots of goods such as rice by the bag, imported oil by the container, and flour by the bag. Marcus describes his shop, \"as you can see, I am gone out of stock and presently I do not have enough money to buy supplies\". In addition, the Liberian dollars to United States dollars exchange rate is too high and he has to pay for supplies in USD.

Sus mayores sue\u00f1os son los de lograr poder apertura una tienda de subenirs ya que en la zona donde ella habita no la hay de esa forma ella ampliar\u00eda m\u00e1s su variedad.\n","en":"Dixa is a 20 year old young single woman who depends on no one.  She has a secondary education and graduated with a bachelors degree in Letters and Science.  She is a visionary young woman with many plans for the future and she is a bilingual kindergarten teacher.  She is also a merchant who buys and sells garden decorations.  She decided to start this business because when she teaches other languages to the children, she noticed that they would get excited whenever they would go outside and see these colorful figures that make children and adults feel happier.\r\n\r\nMost of her business is out of her home and she doesn't have specific days that she can call good or bad because she sells her merchandise to friends and they in turn bring more friends.  One of the major challenges with her business is transporting her products, since she travels every two weeks to buy arts from a distant location and this increases her costs.  She has no competition.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan through the COMIXMUL co-op so she can buy arts and crafts and in this way reduce her transportation costs because she will be able to buy larger quantities and only have to travel every 30-45 days.\r\n\r\nHer mother is the only other person involved in her business and she is very grateful for her support.  Her greatest dreams are to open a souvenir store in her area because there aren't any and in this way she can expand her variety."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":260.02,"image":{"id":1421062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1419373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more fertilizers for use in the rice production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-09-01T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-01T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francois\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":652760,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":652760}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-28T01:05:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":600905,"name":"Amiran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amiran is 48 years old and from a small village of Ambrolauri district.

He is married and is the father of two children. He is retired, and with some savings he began his business, a store that sells paints, solvents, and accessories for finishing. He has equipment to make mixtures and obtain more tones and new colors. He has the help of two direct employees, and he enjoys recognition in different towns and metal-working shops in the region because of his specialty of paints for vehicles. He began his business a year ago and he works from Monday to Saturday from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. Victor did not have experience in this type of business, but he took advantage of the knowledge of his employees, who have been teaching him the different techniques and concepts needed. Now he is applying for the loan with the goal of investing it in the purchase of stock (paints, solvents) and buying fixed assets (mixing equipment). With this he will be able to offer his customers a greater variety of tones and colors and will provide better quality service, with which he will be able to continue being recognized, and this will be reflected in an increase in his sales and his income, which will allow him to position himself in the market and be more competitive. Victor dreams of setting up other branches in other towns in the region and generating more opportunities for employment. This will help him to improve the living conditions of his family and enjoy a prosperous and stable future."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1421308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock (paint, solvents) and fixed assets (mixing equipment)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Yarumal","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-02T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-02T01:20:04Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"V\u00edctor Jos\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149508},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153646},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157899},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162270},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166761},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171377},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176121},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180996},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186006},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191155},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196446},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201883},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207471},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213214},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219116},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225181},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231414},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237820},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244403},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251168},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258120},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265265},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272607},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280153}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.72},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.94},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":601037,"name":"Ariunbold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Ariunbold, 34 years old, lives with his wife and two children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

He could not continue studying because his family lacked economic resources and he had to work in agriculture in order to help his father bring food to the table. He is in a relationship; his partner takes care of the household chores. He says that he has a two-year-old son. He wants him to have the opportunity to study without all the obstacles that he faced.\r\n\r\nMauricio works growing corn and beans. He also works as an assistant to a mason, whenever there is an opportunity to work. He also raises pigs and sells them when they have reached the right weight in the town\u2019s marketplace. His father helps him sometimes, and he helps him in return. He works every day in his plantation and in the afternoon, he feeds the pigs.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy wood and metal sheets to fix his roof, which is in bad shape. Every time it rains, he has to be alert since the wind can blow it away. With the loan, he will have the resources on time in order to buy the materials he needs to improve his house and avoid its deterioration, since it is made of wattle and daub. His family will have a safer place to live in.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to have a decent house. For the moment, he will have to settle with some improvements. However, with hard work and some savings, he hopes to make his dream come true. Another dream he has is that his son can have the opportunity to study and to have a better future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":268.94,"image":{"id":1420420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy wood and metal sheets to repair his roof, which is in bad shape.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-02T12:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-02T12:30:20Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauricio Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29.09},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":30.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":35.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":36.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.06,"local_amount":61.06,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":61.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856901,"comment":null},{"amount":31.28,"local_amount":31.28,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":31.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505168,"comment":null},{"amount":176.6,"local_amount":176.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:23Z","rounded_local_amount":176.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716249,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-02T09:33:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":601131,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is 40 years old and has six children.

Due to the poverty her parents lived in, she only went to school until the 7th grade. When she married she didn't have formal employment, and so she found the money to feed her family by breeding pigs. Three years ago she began to build pigsties with cement roofs and floors to provide better conditions for the pigs. Every morning she washes the floor of each pigsty and gives the pigs clean water and food. In the afternoon she does the same. Her pigs are purebred and she sells their piglets when they are one month old.\r\n\r\nRubenia buys her pigs from other farms with better breeds.

Her fourth child was born with her new husband, with whom she works in agriculture.  Her oldest son is 14 years old and is studying in the first common cycle.  During the week he lives with his paternal grandparents and on the weekends helps his mother with farming.  Her second and third children are 12 and 10 years old and attend school.

That is why they did not send her to school; they only sent her brothers.\r\n\r\nSantos is in a relationship, and her life partner works in agriculture.  Her three children go to school.  She has been selling shrimp and fish for one year.  She says that one day she had nothing for her children.  She found her cousin and told her the situation.  It was her cousin who motivated her to start with the business in order to generate income for the household.  She buys her product about five kilometers from where she lives.  To get there she takes a pick up that drives her to the place.  She buys and then returns home in order to sell it.  She sells by going door to door in the neighboring settlements.  \r\n\r\nHer life partner and one of her children help her to prepare the shrimp.  Her work day starts at 5:00 a.m preparing breakfast and sending her children off to school.  She then goes out to sell for some six to eight hours.  She also works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy shrimp, fish, two sacks of fertilizer and seeds to plant eight plots of corn.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to buy a piece of land in order to build her own house.

Due to the poverty in which she grew up, she didn't have the opportunity to receive an education. She says that her parents died when she was 8 years old, and she came into the care of an aunt.

Her need for money and the desire to improve her family's situation led to her starting the business. She purchases her products about 4 kilometers from her home.
