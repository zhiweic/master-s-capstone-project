She earns a minimum of Php 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 25,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nPaulina hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Previously, he raised livestock at home and sold it at the animal market. When Yusufjon's animals were sick, it occurred to him to learn the butcher's trade so as to be able to slaughter the animals faster without having to look for someone else. Now, he has been working as a butcher for over 10 years. With his brother's help, Yusufjon runs his shop at the central market.\r\n\r\nYusufjon has been working with MDO Arvand, LLC for several years and has been an active and honest client.

","en":"Mavchuda is a woman who works for a government agency. She is 50 years old and has 3 children - two sons and a daughter who is a student.  She has been taking out loans for 2 years and each time she uses the loans to pay tuition for her daughter. She is a student and is not yet married.  Currently she only thinks about her education. Mavchuda works at the Economic Court and has a steady income, however her salary is small. Her son and her husband, who are also working, help her as well. Our financial support really helped Mavchuda as every time she receives a round sum of money and is able to pay the annual tuition contract for her daughter right away.  She intends to collaborate with us in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1124762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay tuition fee for her daughter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-06-25T04:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-25T04:30:08Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavchuda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":137.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":142.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":147.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":152.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":157.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":162.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":168.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":173.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":179.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":185.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.61,"local_amount":137.75,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":145.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397536,"comment":null},{"amount":31.65,"local_amount":142.42,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":150.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452372,"comment":null},{"amount":32.72,"local_amount":147.25,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":155.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308212618,"comment":null},{"amount":33.83,"local_amount":152.24,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":161.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443347,"comment":null},{"amount":34.98,"local_amount":157.4,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":166.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048306,"comment":null},{"amount":36.17,"local_amount":162.74,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":172.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331184290,"comment":null},{"amount":37.38,"local_amount":168.25,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":178.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568256,"comment":null},{"amount":38.66,"local_amount":173.96,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":184.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347117917,"comment":null},{"amount":39.97,"local_amount":179.85,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":190.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863531,"comment":null},{"amount":41.32,"local_amount":185.95,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":196.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572478,"comment":null},{"amount":42.71,"local_amount":192.19,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":203.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971246,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T08:09:21Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":441829,"name":"Ankhbayar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Ankhbayar is 30 years old and a military man.

But it still has some problems such as heat loss and emissions. He is also planning to repair the windows, floor and walls. Last winter was very cold for him and his family without good insulation.\r\n \r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F), even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country become extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. \r\n\r\nBoth homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to its clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will be dedicated to buying building materials to install wall insulation in his home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":574.42,"image":{"id":1124646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy building materials to install wall insulation in his home.

Each case contains 10 chickens, which means that she can sell nearly 20 chickens.  When sales are low, she sells anywhere between 12 and 15 chickens per day.  Anabel has 10 years of experience in this business and wants to invest her loan in more cases of chickens.  Thanks to her earnings, her children never lack anything.  One of her greatest wishes is to see her children press forward and finish their higher education.  \r\n<p>\r\nAnabel joined the group \u201cLas Bugambilias\u201d, which consists of eight women and two men who are dedicated to their work.  With effort, dedication, and responsibility, they have been able to move forward on behalf of their families.  Listed below are the members and each of their business activities:\r\n\u2022\tEduardo sells food.\r\n\u2022\tMaricruz Ericka sells bread.\r\n\u2022\tGenoveva sells tamales and \u201catole\u201d (a

Even though she is retired, she is still a very hard worker and an aggressive one. Her apartment was built in the communist era and since then it has never been repaired or renovated. Last year, it lost too much heat and emissions through the wall and windows. She uses a furnace that uses smoky and toxic coal to stay warm at home. It costs too much and causes air pollution. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. Credit Mongolia believe that together with the borrower, they can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is taking will be dedicated to buying the building materials needed to insulate the walls and make other repairs.

Undrakh, 29, is a hairdresser who rents a cellar room for 150,000 MNT a month. She has been running her business for three years nonstop. She lives with her parents in an old common apartment, which is in the boundary district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Last May, her family purchased a small plot of land and a house in the ger district. A ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic tent.  The house still needs some extra repairs, especially to the walls, roof, floor, and windows. She hopes that her house will be comfortable and have less heat loss or emissions after the repairs. The loan she is taking will be dedicated to buying the building materials needed to insulate the walls and make other repairs to the house that her family bought.  \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2481.7,"image":{"id":1124652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy materials to insulate and repair her house.

She is a salesperson and sells various merchandize like ladies accessories, items for the home, stationary items and refreshments. She began her business in 2006 selling some products and little by little she increased her wares and bought displays that she filled with merchandize that her customers needed most. Flor\u2019s sales are mainly cash down although she also sells on credit to some customers on short terms depending on what they agree. Sometime ago, Flor decided to take advantage of the market and began to sell refreshments and drinks during the weekends. She has done very well and has been able to see her store grow. Flor\u2019s goal is to separate the two businesses, by adapting two areas where she would sell merchandise in one and drinks and refreshments in the other.

En la medida en que sus hijos crecieron ella necesitaba resolver mas necesidades b\u00e1sicas y con esta sola tarea no alcanzaba a lograrlo. Por eso se fue a las colmenas (peque\u00f1os puntos de venta) del centro de la ciudad y empez\u00f3 a trabajar en una de ellas como vendedora. Con esta experiencia en el mercado, dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s decidi\u00f3 independizarse con un dinero, una parte ahorrada y la otra producto de un pr\u00e9stamo de alto costo, que invirti\u00f3 en la compra de calzado, d\u00e1ndose a conocer  en su clientela y entre sus proveedores,  que empezaron a facilitarle cr\u00e9dito; cuando se estabiliz\u00f3 un poco, logr\u00f3 reunir dinero y alquil\u00f3 una colmena, donde vendi\u00f3 mucha mercanc\u00eda econ\u00f3mica durante un periodo de tiempo,  hasta que se organiz\u00f3 con su c\u00f3nyuge y este compr\u00f3 vitrinas para que trabajara cerca a sus hijos, que ya eran 3 y necesitaban de su atenci\u00f3n cercana y aunque al principio atend\u00eda los dos negocios, al final se decidi\u00f3 por el que estaba ubicado en su casa.

For this reason, she started selling fried snacks which enabled her to make money with which to support her children.  As her children grew, she needed to cover more basic needs and with this one job she couldn't manage it.  For this reason, she went to 'las colmenas' (small sales locations) in the city center and started to work in one of them as a sales assistant.\r\n\r\nWith this market experience under her belt, two years later she decided to start working for herself with some money she had (some was savings and the rest was from a high-cost loan).  She invested in buying footwear and became known among her customers and suppliers who started to provide her with credit.  When she had stabilized a little, she managed to get some money together and rent a 'colmena' (small sales location) where she sold a lot of merchandise over a period of time until she made an arrangement with her husband who bought display cases so that she could work near her children, who were 3 and needed her close attention.\r\n\r\nAlthough at first she served in both businesses, in the end she chose to keep the one that was located at home.  This is how the general store she has today was born.  Her store is located in her home and there she sells a little bit of everything.  She has gained a customer base and a position in the market.  Luz Mery's current goal is to expand her business and to have a stock of merchandise that has a high turnover so that, in the future, she can make the most of her infrastructure and start offering printing services.  Luz Mery is gradually taking important steps and this is why she has approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to take out her first Kiva loan.  She will use the loan to buy men's pants, jeans and shirts, and women's accessories as the month of July is approaching and this is a time of year when her sales increase.

She is a very cheerful, hard-working and enthusiastic woman who puts all her efforts into providing for her little one.  Unfortunately, owing to her need to work and cover her expenses, Natali was not able to study for a degree but she would have liked to have studied Administration.  In her free time, she enjoys going for walks though the welcoming city streets together with her young son and she sometimes delights her family by cooking delicious 'tallarines rojos' (red spaghetti).\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, and thanks to the support of her family, Natali set up a small business selling cosmetics and beauty products.  She works around eight hours a day in her business and can serve an average of 12 customers.  Her small business is located in her home and she also makes sales by offering her products through catalogs to her friends and neighbors.  She believes that her business is doing well as her customers recommend her because of her good prices and kind service.\r\n\r\nNatali is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy a display case and more cosmetics and beauty products.  This will give her a better-stocked business and she will be able to increase her sales and income.  This, in turn, will allow her to provide her little one with a good education and provide both him and her parents, who have always supported her, with a good quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1122805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a display case, cosmetics and beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-25T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-25T11:20:03Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":203.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":207.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":215.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":227.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":232.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":244.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":251.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":261.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":275.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":282.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":293.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":304.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":441862,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isabel, aged 58, is from Panglao, Bohol.

Georgi raises cattle, chickens and bees, and grows fruit and vegetables. He sells his products - milk, cheese, eggs, honey and produce - in the city of Kapan. Georgi's products are always in high demand as he consistently maintains their high quality. His honey, particularly, is very popular, as it is organic and very good for health.\n\nGeorgi needs a loan of 1,000,000 dram to purchase a truck, which he will use to transport his beehives from his farm into the mountains, and also to bring hay from the fields for his cows, bulls and calves.\n\nGeorgi is 31 years old. He graduated from the Yerevan Agricultural University. Georgi is married and has a four-year-old daughter. In addition to being a farmer, he works as a forester, while his wife works in a kindergarten. Georgi's parents live together with their family: his father helps with farming, while his mother works as a

is 48 years old and lives in the town of Bombo, in the Luwero region of Uganda. She is married and has 4 children, 1 of them currently in school. For the past 2 years, Aisha has been working hard to manage her stationery shop, which sells books, pens and does printing. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Aisha has requested a loan of 2000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more printing papers and books for resale, and will help Aisha to generate greater profits. Her business has increased from what it was before. Aisha hopes that, in the future, she will be able to get another loan from BRAC so as to expand her business and buy another printing machine. \r\n\r\nAisha is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like Aisha, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1124807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

is a 51 year old married woman. She has 3 children with ages ranging from 18 years to 25 years. She describes herself to be creative and focused. She operates a dairy farm where she sells milk. She has been involved in this business for 12 years. Her business is located within a productive area and her primary customers are co-operatives. She describes her biggest business challenge to be insufficient funds for improving the  business.

is 30 years old and lives in the town of Maganjo, in the Luwero region of Uganda. He is married and has 2 children. For the past 2 years, Fred has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Fred has requested a loan of 2000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Fred to generate greater profits and pay for his family's medical expenses. Fred hopes that, in the future, he will be able to expand his business into a whole sale shop. \r\n\r\nFred is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like Fred, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

is from the village of Kvitiri, West Georgia. She is 26 years old, married and lives with her big family: her husband Lasha, two daughters (3 and 1 years old), parents-in-law and the grandmother. She has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is small scale family farming. They grow greens on a family-owned plot of land. Lia\u2019s parents-in-law sell harvested greens at the local open market. The total average monthly income of the family is 700 Laris. It is hardly enough to pay for food for a seven member family. According to Credo estimations, Lia\u2019s family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLia has requested a loan from Credo for constructing a greenhouse. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lia will purchase iron materials and glass for the greenhouse. She will grow greens (in winter and spring months) and cucumbers (during summer and fall seasons) in the greenhouse. Lia and Lasha will work hard in the greenhouse during the whole year to get quality harvests. Lia\u2019s parents-in-law will sell the harvested products at the open market in the nearby town. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will increase the average monthly income of the family by 50%. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy family members\u2019 daily needs, in order to improve their living conditions.

She is 67 years old, married and lives with her husband: Valenti. Leila and Valenti have requested loans from local financial institutions several times for their agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Their loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nValenti and Leila are refugees from the Abkhazia Region, as a result of the armed conflict in 90s. The main source of the income for the family is a small vineyard with 200 vine trees. Valenti produces wine and sells it on the local open market. In addition, the family gets monthly social assistance for refugees and a pension. The total average monthly income doesn\u2019t exceed 270 Laris, including pensions and social assistance. According to Credo estimations, Leila's family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLeila has requested a loan from Credo for purchasing a milking cow. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Leila will purchase a milking cow. She will place the cow in the old cattle-shed, located in family yard. Leila will milk the cow twice a day and produce cheese. She will be able to sell, on average, 20 kg of cheese per month on the local open market. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will increase the average monthly income of the family by 40 - 45%. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs, in order to improve their living conditions.

She says that she has always wanted to help her husband with the family's expenses, but she was afraid that doing so would come at the cost of neglecting her work at home.  She decided, 10 years ago, to ask him to help her set up a small refreshment stand at their house.  She only sold soft drinks at first but she eventually added fritters and other snacks because that's what the children of the neighborhood most wanted.  She says, \"I like my business because I can see my neighbors . . . especially the children who come here to buy their snacks.  I want to thank everyone who supports my business and the other members of my community bank.  This investment will allow me to improve my business\".

She operates a corner grocery.  She has a sixth-grade education, is married and has 2 grown children, both living away from their mother.  She started her business when she was 47 years old because she wanted her own income.  Her husband and children helped her start it.  She says that she is pleased with her progress because the business is profitable and she has a regular set of customers.  She can count, too, on her children for extra support.  She is applying for a loan because she wants to expand the range of products she sells.

Ricardo is close to building a bedroom on the back of his house; in that way he will continue expanding his house little by little.\r\n\r\nRicardo is married and works in a local gas station. That's how he covers the daily expenses of his family. Given that many people\u2014not just Ricardo\u2014are only able to cover their daily expenses and many can't even afford that, Ricardo needs a loan to start his project.\r\n\r\nThe only thing Ricardo, like many people, is lacking is capital\u2014the money to make his project happen.

de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la ciudad de Cartagena, donde se dedica a la actividad comercial en un negocio que tiene de variedades,  donde ofrece perfumer\u00eda, cosm\u00e9ticos, accesorios femeninos y tambi\u00e9n servicios de fotocopiaje y comunicaciones. Ella inici\u00f3 su negocio desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, cuando vendiendo unos pocos productos de belleza, organiz\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a clientela, con la  que gradualmente fue creciendo y as\u00ed mismo Dannys fue agregando art\u00edculos variados, hasta llegar a vincularse a una empresa a trav\u00e9s de la cual ofrece productos mediante gu\u00edas especializadas o cat\u00e1logos, con la cual le fue muy bien y as\u00ed mismo fue ganando una mayor clientela que ampli\u00f3 su expectativas, porque su especialidad es comprar los productos que llegan con los mejores descuentos, para impactarlos y fidelizarlos. Dannys al mismo tiempo trabajaba como empleada y esto le ayud\u00f3 a construir su propio capital y una clientela con muchos m\u00e9ritos, que la reconoc\u00eda.  Posteriormente como tenia muchos inventarios de mercanc\u00eda guardada en casi todas las habitaciones de su casa, decidi\u00f3 organizar un espacio solo para el negocio y compr\u00f3 vitrinas con las que organiz\u00f3 un peque\u00f1o punto comercial y como hace tres meses dej\u00f3 de trabajar como empleada de una empresa, invirti\u00f3 el dinero producto de su liquidaci\u00f3n, en la compra de  fotocopiadoras, equipos de c\u00f3mputos y estableci\u00f3 su sala internet en su propia vivienda para ofrecer el servicio de telecomunicaciones, pero necesita hacer adecuaciones en el sal\u00f3n para volverlo mas confortable y atractivo y para ganar aun mas clientela. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer finecimiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante la cual adecuar\u00e1 su local, comprara una puerta de vidrio, una puerta met\u00e1lica corrediza tipo estera, para aumentar la seguridad de sus clientes y la suya propia. Dannys todos sus esfuerzos los tiene dirigidos a su negocio, pues con su crecimiento quiere poder brindarle, cada vez mas bienestar a su familia conformada por su esposo quien la apoya en todo y a su hijo de 1 a\u00f1o de edad, con quien en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su c\u00f3nyuge sue\u00f1a verlo convertido en un profesional exitoso. \n\n","en":"Dannys, 32 years old, lives in the city of Cartagena where she has a commercial business, selling  a variety of merchandise, such as perfume, cosmetics, feminine accessories, and also, services for photocopying and communications.  \n\nDannys launched her business some 5 years ago; while selling a few beauty products, she organized a small client\u00e8le, which gradually grew. Danny added various articles, until building an enterprise that offers products through specialized guides and catalogs. It went well, as she earned an ample customer base; since her specialty is to buy products that come with the best discounts, she had an impact and it made her customers loyal.\n\nAt the same time, Dannys worked as an employee and this enabled her to build her own capital and a meretricious client\u00e8le who recognized her. Subsequently, as she came to have a lot of merchandise inventory stored in almost all the rooms of her house, she decided to organize a space strictly for her business and to buy glass showcases in which she could organize a small commercial area. Then 3 months ago, she ceased to work as an employee at an enterprise, investing her separation money in photocopiers, computer equipment, and establishing an internet station and a telecommunications center in her own home. But, for this, she needs to make improvements to the space, making it more comfortable and attractive if she is to gain more customers. \n\nThis is why she sought a Kiva loan, her 1st approach to the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, to fix up her shop, buying a glass door, and a metal, matting-style, sliding door, to improve security for her customers and herself.\n\nAll of Dannys' efforts are aimed at her business, since with its growth, she hopes to be able to offer greater wellbeing to her family, composed of her husband, who helps her in everything, and her son who is 1 year old. She and her husband hope to see him develop into a successful professional.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1124188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"to make her internet shop adequate, buying a glass door and a sliding matting-style, metal door for security reasons.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-25T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-25T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dannys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":124093},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":129555},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":132578},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":135671},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":138837},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":142076},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":145392},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":151798}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.61},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.61},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.51,"local_amount":124093,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":125080.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338926,"comment":null},{"amount":73.61,"local_amount":129555,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":130585.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395480,"comment":null},{"amount":75.33,"local_amount":132578,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":133632.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775269,"comment":null},{"amount":77.08,"local_amount":135671,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":136750.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387269,"comment":null},{"amount":78.89,"local_amount":138837,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":139941.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994100,"comment":null},{"amount":80.72,"local_amount":142076,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":143206.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130463,"comment":null},{"amount":82.61,"local_amount":145392,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":146548.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519334,"comment":null},{"amount":86.25,"local_amount":151798,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":153005.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071175,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-26T04:24:31Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":442121,"name":"Paz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paz is 22 years old and lives in Tigdok, Tudela.

But she needs to go to her capital to get hair extensions and beauty products in perfumeries each time she has a client, because she buys in small quantities and is therefore constantly out of stock, which penalizes her all the time. There are also periods where the clientele don't come often for hairstyling and other services, which makes her need to buy hair extensions and other beauty products by the box to sell.

In the year 2000 she was in search of income for her family, so she started her agriculture and livestock business with starting capital of 3000KGS.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and for methane, which can be captured in storage tanks.  \r\n\r\nThe purchase of a dairy cow,

In the Kathmandu Valley, a small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping their inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

","en":"Reyna is 43 years old. She is from the city of Managua. She is married and a merchant by profession. She is one of the few women in our country who dedicates herself to selling insecticide and fumigation services, an activity which she began 10 years ago. She is the mother of 2 children -- her son is currently studying for a university degree, and her daughter is in the fourth year of secondary school. Reyna started her business through her father, who also worked in the same field. She helped him sell his products, and over time she gained experience and thorough knowledge of the business. Later, she decided to become independent, and she set up her sales area for insecticide in the house where she lives. However, Reyna was not satisfied with that, because her desire is to get ahead. Today, Reyna not only sells insecticides, but she also provides fumigation services, which she has done for the past three years. She works within her own community and in the departments of the city of Managua, Her aim is to eliminate the various pests which are known in the city of Managua. In her business she receives support from her husband, who helps her administer the business. Her expectation is to expand her product line and buy more fumigation equipment to satisfy the needs of her customers, and it is for this reason that she currently needs a loan to buy insecticide and more fumigation equipment. \r\n\r\nShe believes that the loan will be helpful to her because she will be able to invest in her inventory, buying the products requested most often by her customers, and this will generate more income for her. Her future plans are to grow with her fumigation business with help from Kiva, so that she can have a more profitable business.

She is a single mother and she wants to improve her and her son's quality of life by increasing her income. For that reason, she is requesting a loan from Kiva so she can invest in more merchandise; with a better selection, she can improve her profits. Her experience has shown her that it is easier to sell products when customers can see them, rather than just showing them a catalog. Plus, if she makes an investment, she will be able to have better prices and promotional items. With this, she can give her son a better life and buy her own house in the future, since that is her greatest dream.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1124167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Gustavo ha aprendido constantemente a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os las t\u00e9cnicas necesarias para todo lo relacionado a su trabajo y es por eso que le ha ido bien con su negocio y ya tiene varios clientes fieles. El trabaja un promedio de 6 horas al d\u00eda, pero siente que desea crecer para poder abastecerse de m\u00e1s clientes. Por lo tanto, Gustavo est\u00e1 buscando ayuda para recaudar plata y expandir la infraestructura para su trabajo, en este caso busca construir chancheras para poder adquirir m\u00e1s chanchos y conservar ah\u00ed sus animales en \u00f3ptimas condiciones. Para Gustavo ha resultado realmente dif\u00edcil acceder a cr\u00e9ditos que lo ayuden a crecer esto a pesar de que es una persona que no ha incurrido muchas deudas a lo largo de su vida. \nAs\u00ed Gustavo, considera que si se le facilita el acceso a cr\u00e9dito \u00e9l podr\u00e1 seguir trabajando de la misma manera que lo ha venido haciendo por muchos a\u00f1os pero con mayor capacidad y volumen. Con esto Gustavo dice que no solo mejorar\u00eda su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica si no todos los aspectos de la vida de su familia entera. \n","en":"Gustavo is 39 years old, and lives with Ana, his wife, who is 34 years old, and their two children. They live in the Eloy Alfaro Parish, which is in Latacunga. Latacunga belongs to the province of Cotopaxi in Ecuador, and the city is located about 90 kilometers from the capital city, and has a largely indigenous and mixed population. Latacunga is located at an elevation of 2,760 meters above sea level, and is dangerously close to Cotopaxi, the highest active volcano in the world. Throughout the course of history, the city has been affected time and time again by volcanic explosions. The majority of people in the city are economically dependent on the success of their agricultural and floricultural industries, and also make a living in the tourist and culinary industries present in the province. \r\n\r\nGustavo is from this small city, and a little over two years ago, he started a business next to a church raising and selling pigs. Since he has made an effort to learn constantly through experience and through the tasks of his job, Gustavo is doing well in his business, and he has many faithful clients. He works an average of six hours per day, but he wants to grow and expand so that he can serve and accommodate more clients. He is presently looking for support to expand the infrastructure of his business, and he plans to purchase more pigs and build additional pig pens and corrals to accommodate more pigs in his operation and give his animals better living conditions. It has been very difficult for Gustavo to gain access to loans which would help him to grow his business, since he has had to incur debt over the course of his life. \r\n\r\nIf he does gain access to credit and a loan, he plans to continue working as hard as he always has. Gustavo hopes that the support from this loan will help him improve his financial condition and provide a better quality of life for his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1122774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Saliya does animal husbandry which is the main source of income for her family. She started this business with the purchase of a milk cow. Through her hard work and perseverance Saliya now has four milk cows with calves and 0,43 hectares of land where she cultivates potatoes.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Helen hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is a woman from Panglao, Bohol. She has been engaged in a coconut wine business for 10 years now. Some coconut wines are stored and allowed to ferment to be sold as vinegar.

Paleteria was established in February 2004 by Vicenta.  Bety Paleteria manufactures, distributes and sells their own original ice cream recipes and distributes them throughout the city and surrounding communities.   They specialize on manufacturing \u201cAuthentic Mexican Paletas\u201d.  They use actual fruit pieces in their paletas to give them the authentic Mexican taste.  Bety Paleteria started with 1 ice cream cart in 2004 and now has 60 small ice cream carts they use to distribute their ice cream bars (paletas).  \r\n\r\nAlmost anyone who may be looking for some extra income can become a distributor for Bety Paleteria.   They allow people to come in during the hours of 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM to make use of the ice cream carts.  They take their information along with photo id.  Each cart has approximately 100 pieces of ice cream ranging from authentic Mexican paletas to ice cream cones and Cool-sticks.  No initial deposit is necessary or charged.  They are all charged after making sales.  They have been leasing the same location at 1834 W. James M. Wood, Los Angeles, CA 90006 for the past 8 years.  \r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan funds will allow them to purchase a new popsicle packing machine. The new machine will allow the company to customize their packaging by adding graphics to the packaging.  This will further strengthen their brand recognition.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2526.74,"image":{"id":1118921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He has been working in that company for two years. He lives with his wife, a librarian, and son in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His son is a student and always wants to help his parents to increase their family earnings. Also he intends to cover his school tuition fees himself. Recently he decided to buy a car that uses natural gas for running a taxi. According to his plan, he will run his business on weekends and some nights when he has less homework. He believes that using a car which uses natural gas is a big contribution to decrease environmental and natural pollutions. His father, Bold, wants to help his son to start his business. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons Mongolia has hard air pollution.

Sometimes she runs a taxi business for extra profit. Currently she lives with her family in the common apartment in Kherlen, an eastern boundary city in Mongolia. Her living apartment was built in the socialist era before the 1990\u2019s. Since then it has never had any repairs or renovation done to it. It has too much heat loss and emissions through the walls, ceiling and windows. And it becomes too cold and uncomfortable to live in winter time. So that she decided to take a Green loan to make some repairs such as wall and window insulation. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons Mongolia has hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on the natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health.

Tserenkhand, 51, lives with her husband and her son in the staff residence in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. She has worked as a librarian in the university for 26 years. Her husband works in the mining company. They own an apartment with 3 rooms in one of the districts of the city. One of 3 rooms is rented for running a grocery store and the remaining 2 rooms are rented for the residents. Lately her apartment has been bad and having a lot of breaks in it. Also there has been a too much heat loss and emissions through the walls. She had some complaints from her renters. Therefore she decided to make repair, especially wall insulation to her apartment. She thinks that her business will run normally after the repair and renovation. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons Mongolia has hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on the natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan she is taking will be used to cover the cost of the building and insulation materials for her apartment repair.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1126129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to cover the cost of the building and insulation materials for her apartment repair.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-06-26T06:01:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-26T06:01:07Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tserenkhand","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166933.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":139386.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":147495.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":152068.29},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":155341.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":161598},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":163268.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":172613.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":178551.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":181973.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":187802.69},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":192966.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1525,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2032825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294313365,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-23T01:29:45Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:18:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":442883,"name":"Kareem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kareem began HD-LV Apparel Resources in Los Angeles in 2007.

Sales and Distribution was established in 2010 by owner Yoliani to provide wholesale dairy, produce, and paper goods to large and small businesses in the greater Los Angeles area. Their products are ordered 24 hours in advance and ready for pick up or delivery the next day.  With this simple system, their clients are guaranteed the freshest products every day of the week and avoid inventory waste in their warehouse.  Thanks to Yoliani\u2019s efforts and enthusiasm he has managed to increase his client list from just a few clients to over 60 clients in the short 2 years he has been in business.
