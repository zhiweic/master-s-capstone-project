She's 61 years old and comes from a community that is rich in pine and \"oyamel\" forests, and where the majority of residents work in sheep breeding and avocado cultivation, for which the weather is favorable. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Clemen, which is how she's known, leads a group called Estrellas, made up of very hard-working women. They have gone through a rough time lately because, as Do\u00f1a Clementina tells, \"my niece, who was part of our group, got sick recently and was diagnosed with leukemia. It's really painful to see her suffer, although she's already having chemotherapy, thank goodness. I feel sad to see her this way because she was a very healthy woman with many life projects and suddenly got sick and had to be taken into a hospital in Morelia. We now ask God for her prompt recovery and are helping her to overcome her illness faster.\"\r\n\r\nClementina makes a living cultivating avocado and breeding sheep and chickens in her house. She says they have a large piece of land and she and her husband put a lot of enthusiasm in it to provide for their only child, who is a teenager and attends his last semester of high-school. She says that they are being able to support him with a lot of effort and that, although she doesn't have money to leave in bequest, she's supporting his studies to help him get ahead in life. He's responding with good grades. \r\n\r\nClemen has a crop with over 80 avocado trees and, during harvest season, she sells them at the supplies' market in buckets so that she makes a bit more money. She's now requesting a loan to buy fertilizer, insecticide and \"calidra\" to paint her trees to avoid plagues and get the fruit in good condition. She says her dream is to have a big crop and a big henhouse, as she likes animals and plants.

also known as Bartolo for short, is from the village of Big Falls, on the Southern highway of Belize. As a program manager at a local conservation NGO in the district, he is also involved in promoting cacao production in agroforestry systems. According to Bartholomew, he got involved in cacao because it contributes to environmental health and social well-being of the farmers, and because he wants to be a role model for cacao farmers who are the NGOs' target audience.   \n\nThe cacao farm is doing well for Bartolo because production, only in its second year, is picking up quickly to his great excitement. Aside from cacao, he also plants timber to practice the principles of agroforestry promoted in his work. He also plants plantain and pineapple for home use.\n\nBartolo's favorite part of cacao farming is harvesting because unlike other stages of working with cacao, it\u2019s not particularly hard. Harvesting involves picking the ripe pods on the trees and cracking them to extract the seeds inside. A cacao pod typically houses 35 seeds surrounded by a sweet juicy pulp that can be enjoyed as a fruit, but starts fermenting shortly after it is opened. Farmers have the option of either processing their own cacao or selling it wet for centralized fermentation and drying. The challenging part for Bartolo is field maintenance due to his busy work schedule. Oftentimes Bartolo checks on his farm early in the morning before heading out to work. \n\nBartolo is requesting this loan to hire people from his village to clean his cacao farm so that he can focus fully on his job while also maintaining his agricultural activities.

The kids, ages eight to twelve, are all currently in school, and help out around the farm on free time. Teresa takes care of the family, helps out at the farm and makes local Maya crafts including woven baskets from the jippi jappa palm as well as hand bracelets. \n\nNew to cacao farming, Victor was encouraged to enter in the trade by his father, who is a member in the local cooperative.  \u201cI wanted to see what I can doo with it too,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao. Last year, Victor used savings from five years of gardening and landscaping work in the resort town of Placencia to purchase a cacao farm of three acres and around 850 trees. Seeing the benefit of cacao farming already, he is planning to expand the farm by transplanting 250 seedlings raised in bags in an on-farm nursery. \u201cCacao is money in the bank. When you\u2019re harvesting, you feel happy you\u2019re not wasting time with what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \n\nThe tricky parts of cacao farming for Victor and many of his peers are the woodpeckers and the squirrels. Cacao pods are defenseless against the assailants, who work their way through the thick pod to pick at the seeds one at a time. Farmers can save a \u201cbroken into\u201d pod if they find it within a short period of its opening. However, with frequent rains, if any water reaches the seeds housed inside, they germinate and the crop can be deemed useless. \u201cYou could spend the whole day on the farm, come back another day at daybreak and they\u2019d already gotten to your ripe pods,\u201d says Victor, who is looking into buying a pellet gun, among other investments for his farm.\n\nIf all goes well in the cacao growing business, Victor is hoping to open his home and organic farm for tourists. Besides cacao, he grows corn, beans and ginger, and he plans to start planting coffee. Also, alongside his work on the farm, Victor is the Vice-Alcalde (mayor) for his village and works in the nearby Rio Blanco National Park. This loan will help Victor with his first expansion. Before planting, he will first need to prepare the land by chopping the underbrush and lining. Lining is the process of planning and marking the spots where seedlings will be planted to ensure a linear structure and sufficient spacing. The task at hand will require hiring three men to help Victor on the farm for six days. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":333.4,"image":{"id":1299676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean and expand a cacao farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Santa Elena","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":95.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971172,"comment":null},{"amount":78.16,"local_amount":156.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":157.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751697,"comment":null},{"amount":41,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":82.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993438,"comment":null},{"amount":42.29,"local_amount":84.59,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":85.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255607,"comment":null},{"amount":38.54,"local_amount":77.08,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":77.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136447,"comment":null},{"amount":2.5,"local_amount":4.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900664,"comment":null},{"amount":83.41,"local_amount":166.82,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":168.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088545,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T20:34:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529818,"name":"Arceli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arceli offers homemade breads in her locality.

Farmers typically have to clean their cacao fields three times a year. Planting is the process of transplanting seedlings grown in bags for six months into the ground and requires precision in spacing among other things. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":333.38,"image":{"id":1299681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean a cacao farm and plant new seedlings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Big Falls","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clarence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":95.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971173,"comment":null},{"amount":89.46,"local_amount":178.93,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":180.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751698,"comment":null},{"amount":54.43,"local_amount":108.87,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":109.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993439,"comment":null},{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":83.58,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255608,"comment":null},{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":83.58,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":84.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136448,"comment":null},{"amount":56.69,"local_amount":113.39,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":114.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900665,"comment":null},{"amount":1.72,"local_amount":3.45,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088546,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T21:45:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530701,"name":"Pedro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pedro and his wife Juana live in the village of Silver Creek in Belize\u2019s southernmost district of Toledo. The couple has raised six children, aged eight to 35, two of who are still in school. Pedro says he hopes his children make the right choices without having to steer them. \u201cI told them, 'Put your mind to work because farming is hard,'\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao in his second language after Q'eqchi'. \n\nA cacao farmer for six years, Pedro currently manages three acres with about 1,000 cacao trees. Pedro likes cacao because it is a permanent crop that does not require replanting every year. \u201cI like it and my wife likes it too,\u201d says Pedro, adding that she\u2019s been great help at harvest, especially after their oldest boys left to join the Belize Defense Force. His favorite part of cacao is seeing the trees clean. \u201cI don\u2019t like to have the suckers. I like to dress it up. Once it\u2019s clean it bears plenty better,\u201d says Pedro. Cacao farmers refer to suckers as trees that \u201csuck\u201d the fertile topsoil without bearing fruit. Cacao pods are fruits that grow directly on the trunk and house about 35 seeds, which can then go through various stages of processing to make chocolate. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to hire two men to help clean the three acres, a job that could take two weeks with the three of them working daily. Cleaning means cutting the underbrush that surrounds cacao trees and is especially instrumental in preparing land for planting new cacao seedlings. After a portion of Pedro\u2019s farm burnt down a year ago, he\u2019s decided to give it another try and is ready to transplant seedlings raised in a nursery on his farm. Seedlings are small cacao trees raised in a bag, typically for six months prior to transplanting into the ground. Cacao is ready for the ground when it has four or more leaves. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":166.68,"image":{"id":1299683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To hire help to clean and plant over burnt cacao","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Silver Creek","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":42.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971174,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":84.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751699,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":41.66,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":42.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993440,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":41.66,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":42.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255609,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":41.68,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":42.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136449,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":42.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900666,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088547,"comment":null},{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":0.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T20:24:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529819,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis is a 32-year-old father of one child, aged seven years.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nLetecia hopes to make her variety store a grocery store. She dreams of visiting other places and taking a vacation.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They have two children together, ages 3 and 8, who are their greatest motivation to continue working hard despite their adversities in life. Their home is located in the lovely city of Oco\u00f1a. Agriculture is a particularly important industry in Oco\u00f1a, especially the cultivation of rice, beans, and corn, among others. Fishing is also an important industry.\r\n\r\nWhen she has some free time, Erika likes to take walks along the beach, because she loves to distract herself. She also likes to eat one of her favorite dishes, the delicious \"Seco de Pollo\" (chicken stew). Due to her limited financial resources, she was only able to study until the fifth grade of secondary school, but she would have very much liked to have a university degree.\r\n\r\nDay to day, Erika works with plenty of effort and enthusiasm as a farmer. She has a small plot of land where she has planted rice. She works for about 10 hours per day in her business because her plot is located a bit far away from her home, and above all because she always has to pay close attention to her crops. She believes that her work is going well because she is very responsible and thorough, and above all because she likes her work.\r\n\r\nErika is very grateful and happy for the help which the Kiva lenders are offering her, because thanks to their help she will able to buy manure and fertilizer to avoid infestations in her crops and obtain better growth and a better harvest. This will allow her to continue working and fighting to make her greatest dream come true: \"to improve her home\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1298998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy manure and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oco\u00f1a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T20:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T20:50:01Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3037.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778944,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-22T01:03:57Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530232,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Susana de 61 a\u00f1os es soltera y tiene 2 hijos a quienes logro sacar adelante y hacerlos personas de bien , actualmente Susana vive en su casa propia  en compa\u00f1ia de su nieta Alexandra de 13 a\u00f1os a quien cr\u00eda y desea brindarle una mejor calidad de vida.Susana se dedica a la venta de frutas y productos regionales y trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde muy temprano en el puesto de ventas que tiene en su vivienda por esta razon ofrece a su p\u00fablico las frutas mas frescas y saludables .

She is a single mother who puts in plenty of effort to provide for her two-year-old son, who is her greatest motivation to keep working hard despite the adversities in her life. Her home is located in the lovely city of Aguaytia. Agriculture is a particularly important industry in Aguaytia, especially the cultivation of cocoa, cassava, and bananas, among others. It also has some beautiful tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nWhen she has some free time, Sarita likes to listen to music, especially because her little son dances to the sound of the music and that makes her very happy. She also likes to eat one of her favorite dishes, the delicious \"Tallar\u00edn Saltado\" (fried rice with wonton). Due to her limited financial resources, she was only able to study to the primary school level, but she would have liked very much to have a university degree.\r\n\r\nDay to day, Sarita works with plenty of effort and enthusiasm as a farmer. She has a small plot of land where she has planted coffee. She works for about 10 hours a day in her business, because she has to pay very close attention to the growth of her crops and make sure that no infestation affects the fruits of her plants. She believes that her work is going well because she is very responsible and thorough, and above all because she likes her work.\r\n\r\nSarita is very grateful and happy with the help that the Kiva lenders are giving her, because thanks to their help she will be able to buy manure and fertilizer to avoid infestations in her crops. In this way, she will be able to obtain better crop growth and a better harvest. She will then be able to improve her income and continue working and fighting to make her greatest dream come true: \"To build her house with good-quality materials and to provide her son with a profession.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1299013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy manure and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Aguaytia","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T21:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T21:00:09Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T22:49:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529829,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Alma.

The San Jose area is characterised by the development of agriculture, particularly growing cotton, potato, corn, onion, amongst other things. From a young age Luis learned to repair cars and started to work in a little workshop, as his parents had very little money. Because of this he only studied to 5th grade, but he would have liked to study mechanical engineering.\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of effort and saving, Luis managed to get his own business repairing cars, specialising in tyre repairs. Her works around 9 hours a day and serves up to three customers a day.

is 41 years old and lives with his wife, Ekaterine, and their retired parents in the Kvareli district. <p>\r\n\r\nZaza is a farmer, while Ekaterine is a housewife.  The family owns a plot of land, where they grow watermelon and grapes, and they sell the harvested products at the local market. On several occasions, Zaza has requested a loan from local financial institutions for an agricultural start-up business, but without any success. His loan requests were always rejected because of his low income and his lack of experience in the business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. Zaza\u2019s loan request was, however, approved by the Kiva and Credo loan program. The loan program provides businesses with start-up funding to assist the country's rural poor, who do not have access to most credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan proceeds, Zaza would like to purchase a tractor. The tractor would be used to perform agricultural work on the lands of nearby farmers, mainly during tilling and sowing seasons, which would allow Zaza to earn money from those farmers.

With the loan, Shameem will purchase a variety of embroidery materials including needles, threads in a variety of colours, clothing, etc. This will help her to continue her business as well as to increase her net sales and income.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of providing quality education for her children.\r\n\r\nNote: In the picture, Shameem is the one who is raising her

","en":"This is Hanifa, a loving mother who, in spite of her age, is still working hard and doing everything she can for her children.  Her husband unfortunately died a few years ago, leaving her alone with four children.  Since that day, she has had to assume a huge responsibility as the head of her family and the protector of her children.  Besides raising her children, she has had to provide them with food and keep them away from poverty.  \r\n\r\nHanifa worked very hard and was able to find sources of income which allowed her to stand on her feet.  In order to reach her goals, she turned to the organization MDO Arvand and applied for loans more than once.  She repaid these loans on time, which clearly shows that she is a responsible woman and a caring mother.  Thanks to the loans she took, she was able to create adequate living conditions for her children.  \r\n\r\nHaving worked and saved money for some time, she decided to open a small business.  Last year she rented a store and started to sell small everyday items.  She gradually expanded her business, and also started to sell household goods.  The demand for her goods began to increase, and she received orders from her customers to purchase other necessary items.  Today, Hanifa's store contains everything, from matches to kitchen utensils and blankets.\r\n\r\nIn order to further expand her business and to buy more merchandise, Hanifa is requesting a new loan.  This time again, she truly hopes to receive help and assistance from MDO Arvand, in order to further develop her small business.  She thanks MDO Arvand in advance for their support and their trust.  She strongly believes that a brighter future awaits her children and that they will be worthy of their father's name and of the support their mother has given them in her late years."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1292396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase household goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hanifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":108.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":111.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":113.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":116.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":118.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":121.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":123.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":126.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":129.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":131.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.72,"local_amount":108.72,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":108.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863716,"comment":null},{"amount":111.1,"local_amount":111.1,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":111.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572660,"comment":null},{"amount":113.53,"local_amount":113.53,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":113.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971430,"comment":null},{"amount":116.02,"local_amount":116.02,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":116.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751940,"comment":null},{"amount":118.56,"local_amount":118.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":118.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616013,"comment":null},{"amount":121.16,"local_amount":121.16,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":121.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859883,"comment":null},{"amount":123.81,"local_amount":123.81,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":123.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136631,"comment":null},{"amount":387.1,"local_amount":387.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":387.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900826,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-23T04:52:11Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529939,"name":"Theresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theresa is a small trader in Soba, Hohoe community.

","en":"Fotima is a kind and responsible woman who has turned to Arvand for a loan.  She is 42 years old and is married with three children.  Neither Fotima nor her husband have a higher education, which is why they and their whole family raise livestock.  They have ten head of cattle that comprise their only income, which is acceptable.  Fotima learned about this line of work from her parents.  Every week her husband takes the fattened cows to the market to sell and he immediately purchases young calves.  Fotima is trying to increase their business.  For a long time, she has dreamed of making repairs to their home, as they live in very poor conditions.  She hopes to save up the money and maybe this summer she can improve their living situation for her children.  On receiving her loan, Fotima plans to buy a few head of livestock, as they are available at a lower price right now.  She thanks Arvand in advance for their financial support and understanding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1284982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fotima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":488.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":499.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":512.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":488.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":499.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":488.15,"local_amount":488.15,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":488.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550015,"comment":null},{"amount":1011.85,"local_amount":1011.85,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774245,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-23T12:40:36Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529977,"name":"Ziriya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ziriya is married with four children and all her children go to school.

This borrower has in the household a 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs down."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":251.99,"image":{"id":1298640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a water tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Njeri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.52},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.25,"local_amount":2164.19,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2216.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355846275,"comment":null},{"amount":25.83,"local_amount":2214.21,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2268.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768660,"comment":null},{"amount":26.52,"local_amount":2272.74,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2328.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516747,"comment":null},{"amount":27.22,"local_amount":2332.81,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2389.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960351,"comment":null},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":2394.48,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:19:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2452.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820029,"comment":null},{"amount":28.67,"local_amount":2457.77,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2517.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417147,"comment":null},{"amount":29.35,"local_amount":2522.74,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2584.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980675,"comment":null},{"amount":30.2,"local_amount":2589.42,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2652.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880655,"comment":null},{"amount":31.01,"local_amount":2657.87,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2722.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529293,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-22T16:24:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530039,"name":"Mohamed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohamed is married with four children.

lives in the Muranga area of Kenya, which is a heavy pineapple-producing region. She has three children and has been working as a farmer for 10 years.  Her primary sources of income are tea, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nNancy says the most enjoyable part of farming is 'watering my plants!'. Her biggest challenge is 'getting water from the river to irrigate'. Her animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Jesse.'\r\n\r\nNancy was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, and she replied: 'Their terms and conditions are fair.'  She was also asked what she had learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, and she said that: 'Loan must be paid on the agreed day.'\r\n\r\nNancy's highest monthly expense is school fees for her children. When she is asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Nancy says 'I will be able to educate my children because I will have more income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Juhudi Kilimo also uses this evaluation to measure any change in living standards resulting from the loan. Nancy owns a cow, but does not own 'pig, poultry, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. She has in her household 'mosquito net, TV, DVD' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":201.89,"image":{"id":1298649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

lives in the Kitale area of Kenya, which lies in the northern part of the Rift Valley. He has 3 children and has been farming for 12 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and transportation services.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is feeding the dairy cows to improve their productivity! His biggest challenge is diseases and lack of animal pasture during dry seasons. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Maua and Upendo.\r\n\r\nMoses was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied that he learnt that they give loans to farmers at a lower interest rate as compared to other Micro Financial Institutions. This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. He answered that they are loans given to small scale farmers and businesses.\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked how this loan benefit your family, Moses replied that the income generated from the sale of milk will help me to pay school fees for my children.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Moses owns the following a cow, poultry, bicycle, and motorcycle but does not own a pig, pump, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household, a mosquito net, and TV but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":376.2,"image":{"id":1298673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

","en":"Akram was born in 1969 in a rural area. He is married and has 4 children. He does not have post-secondary education because he was unable to study in his younger years. He earns his livelihood by repairing shoes, and he is proud of his work. He began as an apprentice in this field when he was 25 years old. For 5 years he worked with a master cobbler (mentor), then he rented his own business premises. Now his services are in big demand and he has several apprentices. However, his workshop is in bad condition and he has decided to renovate it. For this reason, Akram has approached Arvand for a loan that will allow him to buy building materials so he can fix his place of business and create a better atmosphere for himself and his clients. He is very grateful to Arvand. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1292433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":" to purchase building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akram","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":148.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":155.58},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":162.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":169.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":177.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":185.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.5,"local_amount":148.88,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":159.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863719,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":155.58,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":166.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572663,"comment":null},{"amount":36.58,"local_amount":162.58,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":173.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971433,"comment":null},{"amount":38.23,"local_amount":169.9,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":181.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751943,"comment":null},{"amount":81.69,"local_amount":363.06,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":388.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616016,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-22T17:21:55Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530024,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"\nCasada e m\u00e3e de 2 filhos que frequentam a Escola, vive na casa pr\u00f3pria e sustenta seus pais enviando dinheiro para auxiliar nas despesas alimentares.\n\u00c9 docente e quadro do Minist\u00e9rio de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o.

","en":"Rahmon lives in the rural area, in a village far away from town. Rahmon works in construction and house renovation; he also has some experience raising livestock. He launched his livestock business by buying a single cow and developing this business further. The cow produced milk, which Rahmon sold to buy feed. At first things were hard for him, especially during wintertime, when the ground would be covered with snow and he would have to spend more on feed. But, as time went by, he gained experience, and started finding solutions and means to manage his business better. At present he has over 30 heads of cattle. His wife and five children also help out in this business. Rahmon needs additional means to buy more cattle. This is why he applied to MDO Arvand for a loan. He plans to use this loan to buy cattle for growing his business

","en":"Cholponai is 54 years old. After the fall of the USSR and the dismantling of the collective farm system, she received a portion of land, which is how she ended up starting her own business in 1992 with a sum of just 5,000 Kyrgyzstan Som. Since that time, she has been working in animal husbandry and growing crops. Thanks to her hard work, her business brings in a monthly profit of 15,000 Som from the sale of milk and dairy products, and the sale of crops generates an annual income between 50,000 and 100,000 Som, depending on what kind of season it has been.

Her husband works in Kazakhstan. As the main breadwinner of the family, from the time she finished high school 20 years ago, she began working in animal husbandry and growing crops. She started her business with a sum of 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som, buying 1 calf. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now includes 2 dairy cows and 8 sheep.

Her previous loans were personal, and she now wants to take out a loan to start a new business. She urgently needs to set up a business because her husband works as a driver and earns a small salary. His earnings are not sufficient to provide for their 3 children. For this reason, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" which was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she received a certificate.

","en":"Halimjon is a kind and responsible young man. He is married and has 1 child. From his early childhood, he helped his father raise cattle, as this was the family business. He now knows all the ins and outs of raising cows. He works as a stockman, and all the residents of his village trust him with their herds because he is conscientious and trustworthy person. He pastures the cattle in the mountains. He also has his own cattle which he fattens and re-sells, as there is a big demand in his village. His wife is a homemaker who raises the children, but when Halimjon goes far away into the mountains, she takes care of the cows. Halimjon now wants to increase his herd, and for this reason he has come to Arvand for a loan which he plans to use to buy cattle so he can develop his business.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

daily by residents of El Sauce. \r\n\r\nIn this marvelous piece of land dwells Ervin de Jesus, a 51-year-old man who has spent almost his whole life working as an inspector of diseases which are carried by mosquitoes, and who struggles day by day to encourage the population to maintain cleanliness in their home to avoid these types of diseases that above all attack children and the elderly.\r\n\r\nErvin is a responsible person and homeowner who has tried to give the best to his wife and his two children within his ability. \r\n\r\nAt this time he has the need for a loan to cover the educational expenses of his children, to pay for school supplies, uniforms, school shoes and tuition, since his salary does not cover these expenses which he will have to incur at the start of the school year. He trusts God that Kiva's lenders, through Ceprodel, will finance this loan so he can carry out this investment in the future of his children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":499.84,"image":{"id":1299028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

She also sells milk, having started out with 2 dairy cows that her parents gave as a wedding present. Today, her farm includes 6 dairy cows and 20 horses, and brings in around 25,000 Kyrgyzstan Som each month from the sale of dairy products and re-sale of cattle. For the purpose of further developing her business, Jannat has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 135,000 Som to buy more livestock.

She is a friendly and hard-working woman. \r\n\r\nWhile searching for new sources of income in 1996, Gulmira started her own animal husbandry and crop farming business with an initial investment of 3,000 som. Thanks to persistence and hard work she was able to develop her business so that it now brings in a monthly income of 13,000 som and 70,000 som during the harvest season. Gulmira currently owns two dairy cows, two bulls, and ten sheep and goats. \r\n\r\nGulmira turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a 100,000 loan to purchase more heads of cattle.

She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy a young milk-giving cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Rita plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. \r\n\r\n In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and from which methane can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

She and her husband are raising four children; their youngest is a two-year-old daughter.  The family mostly works in livestock and agriculture.  Beginning ten years ago with almost nothing, their business now brings in around 20,000 KGS a month from the sale of milk and dairy products.  In the winter time, Gulanda sells fruits and vegetables at a market.  With the goal of increasing the number of animals among her livestock and the work available during spring, Gulanda has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy livestock and fertilizer to cultivate the land for planting.  She plans to use the income from the loan to buy two dairy cows which will allow her to improve her financial position and, in the future, make repairs to her home.

Apong runs her business as a tailor and she also has a business selling vegetables in the morning in front of her house. Her latest business is still running this month. Apong's husband is a hospital labourer, but his income is not enough to fulfill her household needs while all of her children are attending school.\r\nApong, as a member of 2-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner VisionFund Indonesia in order to use it to increase their capital.\r\nFor the past 5 years she has been running her tailoring business. Her income plays a vital role for the family.\r\n\r\nShe wants the financing to purchase tailor utilities; thread, rubber bands, linen-sheet drapery, pillowcase drapery, and some kind of vegetables for her latest business. Presently she is facing a very difficult time because her husband is sick now and she needs more money to buy medicine.

She began with only 6,000 KGS.  Thanks to her enormous efforts to develop the business, she has found success.  Today, she owns 1 horse, 5 sheep and 5 goats.  Each year, the family farms 15 hectares of land where they plant beans and potatoes.  Their business brings in around 6,000 KGS each month from reselling cattle and between 100,000 and 200,000 KGS per harvest.  In order to further develop her business, Kunduzkan has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 KGS to buy fodder and one dairy cow.

The oldest is a 21-year-old daughter.  Since the sudden death of her husband in 2009, Rakhat has worked selling women's clothing.  She started her business with 20,000 KGS.  Now, thanks to her hard work and strong character, she has many clients.  Each month, her income is around 20,000 KGS.  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS to buy women's spring and summer clothing.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about ten liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD 0.50. \r\n\r\nIn addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php11, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEdna hopes to have a restaurant someday and dreams of being successful in life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

This has allowed her to be known among her clients for her quality and innovation with her clothes. \r\nShe considers this work profitable since with her earnings she can help her husband with the household expenses and give more comfort to her children. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that before starting this work she had many economic problems.

","en":"Norma is a 30 year old woman and is married. She is a fighter, a businesswoman and has a lot of desire to get ahead. Together with her husband, she has three children who are studying in school. She and her husband work in agriculture planting corn, beans, vegetables, sweet chiles, cucumbers, etc. She does not have any education because her parents had very few resources and were not able to support her, but she learned to work the earth when she was very young. Her parents taught her this activity. Today she, together with her husband, are adding other products for planting. Their produce is sold and marketed in the areas around their home, in the local market and through brokers who certify their produce as healthy, without contamination and not treated with chemicals or other items that make them grow at an accelerated rate. The land that they work on is not their own property because they rent where they live. At the same time, the owner helps them by giving them permission to work the land to provide for their necessities like food, clothes, medicine and most importantly, the studies of their children. \r\n\r\nNorma needs assistance to purchase an electronic irrigation pump. It will benefit them more than the pump that they have right now because the current one uses combustible fuel and, due to the rise in pricing and instability of this fuel, it increases their costs and prevents them from getting earnings. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to see her children graduate from a university so that they can have better employment opportunities, better earnings and a better lifestyle and also to continue supporting her husband each day according to their ideals and to get head together as a family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":667.64,"image":{"id":1299710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She is married to Alvin and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nNancy maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNancy hopes that her business will grow bigger, and she dreams to have a good life.
