Una vez all\u00ed logr\u00e9 darle sentido a muchos de mis interrogantes y mayor complejidad tambi\u00e9n.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de dos a\u00f1os de experiencia como psic\u00f3loga en una instituci\u00f3n de protecci\u00f3n a ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as cuyos derechos han sido vulnerados, nuevamente he sentido el mismo impacto. Sobre todo por las maneras tan diversas como ellos asumen la vulneraci\u00f3n o amenaza de sus derechos. Precisamente deseo conocer, en el marco de mi tesis de maestr\u00eda, la manera c\u00f3mo los han aprehendido y c\u00f3mo esto incide en la forma de asumir la vulneraci\u00f3n y amenaza. A partir de lo anterior, me propongo el dise\u00f1o de una estrategia de formaci\u00f3n en derechos desde el grado de transici\u00f3n hasta el quinto de primaria.\n\nFinalmente, \u00e9se impacto que naci\u00f3 en m\u00ed durante la ni\u00f1ez y que me acompa\u00f1\u00f3 en la Universidad, se ha convertido en un imperativo social de bienestar y justicia hacia la ni\u00f1ez. Imperativo que requiere la uni\u00f3n de esfuerzos y la puesta en marcha de una red de trabajo a la que me adscribo, e invito a Kiva a que se una a esta causa pues su apoyo representa un motor de arranque para este objetivo.\n\n","en":"Angelica, 32, studied psychology at Valle University in Cali, Colombia and says that she was able to finish her degree thanks to the unconditional support of her mother, brothers and sisters.  She had an excellent academic record at the university and received a stipend that covered the cost of her tuition there.  The stipend was a big help for her family, who operate a clothing sales business, as well as for her.\r\n\r\nAngelica now wants to study for a masters degree at the L'Ecole des Hautes Etudes in France.  She is applying to Kiva lenders for a loan that she will use to cover the costs of translating and processing official documents, related travel expenses, and tuition fees.  \r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nI knew from the time that I was seven years old that I wanted to work with children.  We were living in Venezuela then and my mother was caring for children there.  I wanted to understand how children developed and, above all, the way that family, social and cultural dynamics shape children.  That urge I felt led me to study psychology, but I had to wait five years before I could start at the university because I had to work and pull enough money together to pay the related costs.  Once there, I was able to make sense of the many questions that I had and work through the complexities they entailed.\r\n\r\nAfter two year as a psychologist at an institution for the protection of children whose rights had been violated, I knew that I wanted to learn more.  I was struck by the many, many ways that the rights of children are violated and threatened.  Specifically, I wanted to understand--to put it in the context of my planned masters thesis--the process for arresting children and the ways that the process relates to violations and threats to children's rights.\r\n\r\nThis urge, then, awakened first in my childhood and still strong through my years at the university, has become a social imperative for children's rights and well-being.  An imperative that requires a joint effort and the advancement of the work to which I have dedicated myself.  I hope Kiva lenders will join the cause because your support represents the engine that will drive us to the goal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1213385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to study for a career as an advocate for children's rights.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ang\u00e9lica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1034000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1034000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1034127.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042089,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T16:24:44Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":482368,"name":"Yenny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yenny de 27 a\u00f1os est\u00e1 casada con Juan con quien tiene 2 hijos de 11 y 8 a\u00f1os.

They live in their own home which is located in a small rural village.  Elvia is a woman who carries out her duties well.  She worked hard to build her own home and to acquire her own farmland where she grows '\u00fanica' and 'yungay' varieties of potato.  She also sows vegetables such as peas and beans but she says that her main crops are tubers because they are always good quality when she harvests them.\r\n\r\nElvia and her husband work together in the fields.  However, when the work is more physically demanding, they have to hire more workers and the people in the community all come together to work.  They all support each other.  Elvia plans to sow potatoes this month and so she is requesting your support to acquire some organic fertilizers.

They live together in their own house, which they built, with great effort, in a small rural community.  Marina is a diligent and hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nThanks to her native city\u2019s fertile land, she is able to successfully develop her business activity, farming.  She now grows potatoes, \u2018olluco\u2019 [a type of Peruvian tuber], corn, and peas.  These products have given her the income needed to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe sells everything that she harvests at the wholesale market in Tarma.  That is where she gets the best prices for her products.  She has been working in the fields for 40 years, and she says that it is going well for her.  She says that the most difficult part is transporting the products to the wholesale market because means of transportation are scarce in her area.\r\n\r\nIn time she wishes to buy new land in order to increase her production.  However, for now she will do her best with the pea and potato crops that she wants to plant this month.

Sus actividades son varias, pero lo que le agrada realizar es cuidar sus cultivos. Ella siembra con frecuencia papas, arvejas y flores de gladiolos. Con mucho esfuerzo Irene ha logrado trabajar sus tierras y volverlas muy productivas. Cuando llega la hora de la cosecha, Irene prepara todo un evento.

De esta manera consigue que sus frutos sean solicitados cuando los traslada hasta el mercado mayorista de Tarma. \nLleva 30 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y piensa, m\u00e1s adelante, comprar nuevas tierras, para ampliar su producci\u00f3n.

The couple have a 29-year-old daughter.  Irene and Roque live together in their own home, which is built from rudimentary building materials, in a rural district.  Irene is a very strong and responsible woman.  She carries out a number of different tasks but what she most enjoys doing is caring for her crops.  She sows potatoes, peas and gladioli frequently.  With a lot of effort, she has managed to work her land and make it very productive.  At harvest time, she prepares a whole event.  She hires more workers, cooks their food and gets the animals ready to plow the land and carry materials.  In this way, she ensures that her crops are in demand when she takes them to the wholesale market in Tarma.\r\n\r\nIrene has been in this business for 30 years and she plans, in the future, to buy more land and expand her growing area.

He\u2019s trained more than 30 All-American athletes, and over the past eight years, helped the Rockwall community achieve what it thought were unachievable goals. \r\n\r\nOne of those community members is Jim, who, along with several RRC members, helped Coach Barrett publish a book titled \u201cRRC Baker\u2019s Dozen (plus two) take on the NYC Marathon.\u201d Jim wrote: \u201cI\u2019m a runner and I\u2019m so glad that God used runners like Lee Chatham, Coach Barrett, Sonya Johnson and others to encourage me to join them on these group runs. It\u2019s helped me learn firsthand about runners who go the extra mile to train\u2026. But it has also allowed me the opportunity to see a group united in their care and concern for their fellow runners\u2026\u201d \r\n\r\nCoach Barrett\u2019s training began in the 1980s when he was in college helping high school athletes, and by 1996, his work snowballed into a training club, which eventually expanded into a business. Coach Barrett, originally from North Carolina, participated there in organizing several community group runs. He moved to Rockwall eight years ago for work and started the first of now 10 daily running groups. Coach Barrett said he wanted to bring runners to one place and gain identity with the community--or as he calls it \u201caction with passion.\u201d He began a separate running team to run marathons nationwide, which expanded from three to 300 members.\r\n\r\nCoach Barrett is also the Southwestern region\u2019s association member of the Masters, Men\u2019s, and Women\u2019s Long Distance Running Committees of the USA Track & Field, the national governing body for track and field in the U.S. He said RRC offers training to get people off their couches and running a 5K, or 3.1 miles.\r\n\r\nHis Accion Texas Inc. loan will help his business be competitive, he said, as he\u2019ll use it to purchase nutritional snacks, first aid items and name-brand running shoes to sell at the center\u2019s store. Other major businesses already have a large inventory to offer their clients. As a small entity, Coach Barrett could not compete; the loan gave him an opportunity to build a better inventory for his clients, he said. The loan helped sustain eight RRC jobs, as well.  Without Accion\u2019s help, Coach Barrett said, \u201cWe would have to close shop.\u201d\r\n\r\nContinuing to stay community-focused, Coach Barrett said RRC already has booked 20 events between January and June 2013. He expects that number to increase.

She is married and has one child who is age 18 and at the college level. She has one additional dependent, a friend's daughter who lives with her for a better education.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Mary H. established her beauty salon business. She began her business because she was given away in an early marriage, as her supposed husband was a wealthy businessman. Her parents saw it as a means of survival for her to get married to him. When she got married, her aunt advised her to learn the hairdressing trade, which she did, and now she owns a shop. \r\n\r\nWorking 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 541,000 SLL every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Mary H. requires a loan in order to purchase hair attachments: <ul><li>Charming Hair - 2 dozen @ 360,000 SLL<\/li>\r\n<li>Expression Braiding Hair - 10 dozen @ 150,000 SLL<\/li>\r\n<li>Afro Kinking - 2 dozen @ 260,000 SLL<\/li>\r\n<li>Hair Glue - 4 dozen @ 60,000 SLL<\/li><\/ul> The balance, 20,000 SLL, will be used for her transportation costs.

cattle. On his farm, he has a cow and two bulls. Nosirdjon also works as a foreman at a construction company. His wife works as a cook in a kindergarten. They have three children. \r\n\r\nNext year, he plans to use his assets to start construction on his home and to complete two more rooms.

Hernando in his efforts to expand his Miami-based marketing company, \"Sphere Marketing and Advertising Inc.\" Hernando is originally from Colombia and came to the United States five years ago looking

He is proud to be the owner of the company he started to work with when he arrived in the United States. He was able to consolidate a company that understands clients' needs to know how to sell and market a new or existing product. Hernando's biggest challenge was surviving the financial crisis when most of his clients reduced their budgets for TV and radio commercials. Hernando is fully dedicated to expanding his work and has found a niche in providing specialized services to distributors of natural products, which base most of their sales on advertising. Hernando\u2019s company designs marketing campaigns for this type of client. He offers a full package of radio \/ TV \/ graphic advertising. For infomercials, he buys \"air space\" on Spanish TV channels. He still does not have the working capital and equipment to produce an infomercial, so he hires an independent contractor when needed. Costs for TV space and video productions are very high, so Hernando is looking for a loan that he can use to buy TV air time in advance, which would increase his profitability and strengthen his position to negotiate better prices with local and national channels. This loan will help him expand his service and at the same time generate more jobs.

Glenda\u2019s husband passed away in 1996, she and her son James took over the family landscaping business, JPC Enterprise, in Alabama. At that time, they had some problems managing the company because they had little knowledge of landscaping. Soon James was offered a job in a big company fixing landscaping machines and JPC Enterprises was put on hold. Three years ago, James was laid off from the company he was working at. Glenda felt it was the time to reopen their company and she relaunched the landscaping repair shop where they repair and sell landscaping tools, since James already had learned about managing and repairing these types of machines. \n  \nGlenda\u2019s dream is to help her son build a future, which is why she decided to help him get started with his own business. She runs the business while James helps her with orders and repairs. At the same time, she has gained interest in landscaping and she enjoys meeting new people in her community. But for Glenda, starting a business has not been easy. Cash flow and working capital are a real challenge. Therefore, Glenda is looking for a loan to purchase new equipment that would help her grow the business and hire two full time employees that would help improve the services to her customers.  Support Glenda and James in this new chapter of their family business.

Fabio Antonio first arrived in the United States 11 years ago and started working for a carpentry company in New York. His boss saw in him great potential and always encouraged him to open his own business. This was one of Fabio\u2019s motivations to start FAAF Woodwork Inc in 2004. His company specializes in installations and remodeling of wooden furniture in kitchens, bathrooms, restaurants and clubs. Fabio is the only owner and employee, but he hires subcontractors when needed for the job. He is very passionate about what he does and he is constantly looking to improve and learn new things. To Fabio, success is people recognizing him for his work and having continuous upcoming projects. The biggest challenge he has is getting people to know his work.

Having been involved in this business for nine years, Kanha and her husband are able to earn about 22,000 KHR per day and can save about 10,000 KHR each day after deducting daily expenses.

Kanha, who is the leader, will use her portion to buy fertilizer for her cultivated land and utilize a portion of it to spend on labor costs in transplanting rice seedling and water pumping.

In the future, Idrissa plans to educate his children at whatever level they choose.  The loan is another source of income to help him.

He began his business because his father was a farmer, and going to school was not an option as the farm needed his help.  He worked through his teenage years in the village with his family, and then decided to join a friend in Makeni Town in his second-hand business.  <p>\r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, Ibrahim II earns about Le 875,000 every month, usually selling his goods to peddlers and passersby. Shortage of supplies is his major problem.

She hopes that in the future, she will be able to start another business where she will be selling wholesale. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1211537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"restock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Callao Sur, Lasm, Cagayan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T22:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T22:00:21Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arsenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-19T09:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3109.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316071622,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2591.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322921538,"comment":null},{"amount":53.5,"local_amount":2140,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2218.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331917233,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2591.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339443633,"comment":null},{"amount":46.5,"local_amount":1860,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1927.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346995783,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-16T00:46:34Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:22:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":481347,"name":"Rose Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twenty-three-year-old Rose Ann is a hardworking mother who deals in a sari-sari store business.

is a 27-year-old rice farmer who lives in a rural area of the Kror Kor district of Pursat province, Cambodia. She has one daughter who is still under school age. Besides growing rice on a two-hectare area of farmland, she also supplements her income by working as a paid worker in the local area. Having engaged in this business for several years, she is able to earn about 20,000 KHR per day and save about 10,000 KHR each day after daily expenses.

He has two children, a son who is a paid worker and a daughter who attends school. For his children's sake and especially for their daily food, he manages one hectare of rice-paddy farmland and also does cow trading (buying and resale). Having been engaged in these businesses for 10 years, he is able to earn almost 17,000 KHR. \r\n\r\nRoeurn has been with VisionFund for three loan cycles and has already entirely repaid the previous loans. He has used his loans wisely to sustain his living conditions as well as his businesses. Now, he leads a group of two who are applying for a new loan.

As her main source of income, Almash has been raising livestock and growing crops for the past 5 years, having started her business with a sum of 7,000 som.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nFlora maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer's prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFlora hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEvangeline hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

With this business, she has been able to contribute economically to her household so that her family can have a better quality of life. With a great deal of effort, she has been overcoming her difficulties in acquiring capital, little by little.

She lives with her husband, her 27-year-old son and two grandsons, who are 20 and 11 years old and whom she provides for. Silvia's professional dreams are to keep her business and her customers. Her personal dreams are to stay healthy so as to keep making money and improve her family's quality of life. She is very happy and grateful for the opportunity afforded to her by field partner Fondo Esperanza, since the loan will allow her to invest in her business. She says that the communal bank she belongs to has great communication between the members. Furthermore, the training dispensed there was very useful to her, as she was able to learn new sale strategies as well as accounting techniques.

is Dante, 46, resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. His wife is Dorotea, the mother of his two children. Together with his wife, Dante manages their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDante operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. Dante hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving his family a good life. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1212401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay
