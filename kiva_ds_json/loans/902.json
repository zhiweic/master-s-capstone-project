Luz acaba de cosechar caf\u00e9, por eso sus terrenos necesitan de cuidados y fertilizantes para empezar a producir, por eso no duda en levantarse muy temprano para atender a su familia y luego partir hacia sus cultivos que se encuentran a media hora de su comunidad.

Her partner is Roger and the couple have two children: 4-year-old Diana and 2-year-old Jairo.  They live in a house made from rustic materials that Luz and Roger built three years ago.  The house is located in the indigenous community of San Pablo de Shimashiro (in the central Peruvian jungle).\r\n\r\nIn spite of her age, Luz is a tenacious mother whose business is farming.  Every day she heads to her land to carry out different tasks such as weeding, spreading manure and fertilizers, protecting her crops from insects, pruning, harvesting, etc.  \"Farm work is very tiring and so sometimes we hire workers\", she says.  The community gave her two plots of land.  She grows coffee on one plot and pineapples on the other.  Luz has just harvested her coffee and so her land needs to be cared for and fertilized before it starts producing again.  Luz doesn't hesitate to get up very early to see to her family and then go out to her crops which are half an hour from her community.  Right now, she is hoping that her pineapples will grow a little more so that she can start her first harvests.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Luz has received a loan from MFP and she pledges to be punctual.  She is a member of 'Los Shirokis' community bank and she believes that the group work will be more bearable.\r\n\r\nLuz will invest all the money she is requesting in buying bags of fertilizer at 125 soles a bag."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1135348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers for her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-15T10:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-14T10:00:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576694,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-17T13:59:32Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449353,"name":"Awa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mise en place le 14 D\u00e9cembre 2010, ce banc villageois est compos\u00e9 de femmes d\u2019une motivation exemplaire \u00e0 faire face aux difficult\u00e9s de leur milieu.

His business is buying and selling food products and he does this every day.  Every day he goes out with his small cart and sells in all the streets, providing housewives with fruit, vegetables, tubers and meat, products that every household consumes on a daily basis.  His business idea came about when he left the south of Bol\u00edvar department, looking for better opportunities for work and peace in the city of Barranquilla.  He started selling beef, chicken, fruit, vegetables and tubers.  He is still in the same business now and travels from street to street in the south-west of the city.  He sells retail and by the unit, ounce or pound.  He sells to customers who do casual work and odd jobs or to housewives who need to buy small amounts.  He buys his products for cash and makes his sales in the same way.  His business is growing but he does not have enough working capital to respond to his customers with competitive prices which he could manage if he were to buy in larger quantities.  This is why he is applying for a Kiva loan (his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  He will use it to buy meat, vegetables, cassava, bananas and chicken.  With his Kiva loan, he will be able to take advantage of discounts that his suppliers in the market have promised him if he makes his purchases cash in hand and buys larger quantities than he usually does.  His goal in the future is to buy his own home where he can set up his business, in a very busy commercial area.  This will mean he will no longer have to walk the streets every day selling his products and his work will become much easier."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1136394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy meat, vegetables, cassava, bananas and chicken in larger volumes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-15T12:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-14T12:50:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marceliano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62622},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73417},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75130},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":76883},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78677},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80512},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82391},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":84313},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86281},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99774}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.22,"local_amount":62622,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":62858.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395530,"comment":null},{"amount":41.3,"local_amount":73417,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":73694.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775313,"comment":null},{"amount":42.26,"local_amount":75130,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":75414.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387318,"comment":null},{"amount":43.25,"local_amount":76883,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":77173.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994144,"comment":null},{"amount":44.26,"local_amount":78677,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":78974.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130503,"comment":null},{"amount":45.29,"local_amount":80512,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":80816.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071214,"comment":null},{"amount":45.01,"local_amount":80013,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":80315.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497427,"comment":null},{"amount":48.76,"local_amount":86691,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":87018.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381706041,"comment":null},{"amount":104.65,"local_amount":186055,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":186758.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083151,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-22T22:55:24Z","paid_date":"2013-11-27T09:49:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449364,"name":"Sambacoulibaly Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe est compos\u00e9 de 24 femmes tr\u00e8s actives dans ce banc villageois cr\u00e9\u00e9 en D\u00e9cembre 2010.

She lives in the small village of Zugdidi with her family -- her parents, who are pensioners, two sisters and a brother. The family earns their living through the agricultural business. They have a milking cow, a calf, a horse and three pigs. They sell piglets in nearby villages. The family also owns a plot of land, where they grow maize, nuts, and laurels. They are especially busy on their plot during the spring and summer seasons to get a good harvest. They sell harvested products in the local open market. The total average monthly income of the family is 800 Lari. They still don\u2019t have enough income to make some savings for purchasing additional household goods or renovating their house. Their income is hardly enough for food and everyday expenses for six members of the family. \r\n\r\nTsitsino requested a loan for purchasing nuts.

Her husband is Charlie, a security guard, and she is a mother to her child.  She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nMarilyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and also for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes her business will expand and grow into a mini-grocery through all her hard work. She also hopes to give her child a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1140455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-15T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-14T14:20:06Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":7999.98,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8379.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303457,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.02,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2793.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356194,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5332.96,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5586.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114292,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.04,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4190.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350341,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-16T08:09:33Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449735,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie, who is married and has a ready-to-wear business in the Philippines, works hard to support her family.

He and his mother started a restaurant in Cartagena two years ago and moved it to Barranquilla when they returned there.  They open the restaurant for breakfast and lunch.  Their main customers are people who live in the neighborhood or workers at the factories nearby.  Julio wants to study for a degree in Electronics.  He hopes that his business will grow and prosper because it is the main source of income for him and his family.  He plans to buy bulk supplies of the goods he needs for the restaurant so that he can save on transportation costs, lower his costs for the goods and save the time he has to spend buying what he needs for the restaurant.  He will use this Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo loan, with help from Kiva lenders, to buy what he needs--rice, cooking oil, pasta, salt, sugar, sauce and tableware--to operate his business and provide a better service.  The investment will help him grow the business.  Our analysis shows that he can cover the costs of his monthly payments with only 18 days of revenue and that his profit margin is 18% or more.

","en":"Luz Dary is 47 years old.  She is a married woman who lives in the south of the city together with her husband and her two children who are 18 and 21 years old.  She has been selling bags, belts and footwear for 15 years since she started her business to make a second income for her family and improve the welfare of her household.  Luz Dary sells bags and leather goods every day direct to end consumers.  She mainly sells on credit although she also occasionally sells for cash.  She buys directly from manufacturers for cash.  Her customers are company workers who make a salary and so her business has done very well.  On pay days she goes to visit her customers in order to collect payment.  She is currently applying for a Kiva loan.  It is her seventh from  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and previous loans have enabled her to have capital available.  This has increased her possibilities for buying merchandise and increased her sales volumes.  Luz Dary will use her Kiva loan to respond to orders that her new customers have promised to place with her.  These are customers who have been referred to her and who will help her to strengthen her business even further.  Luz Dary will buy footwear, bags and wallets in larger quantities.  She plans to grow her business as she hopes to support her children in finishing their university studies.  Her biggest challenge is finding new manufacturers so that she can diversify the fashionable designs she sells as this attracts customers.  It also helps her to stay in the market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1136442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

The revenues from her business will allow her to grow her savings and to provide for part of the everyday family expenses and her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1135525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to stock up on staple foods from wholesalers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2012-07-15T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-14T18:00:06Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djilang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Idiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dienabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anne Marie Noelle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocky","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fanseyni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata B Sadio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna Badiare","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadidiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Binta Amadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Telly Bailo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sounkarouo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1755000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1755000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3275,"local_amount":1755000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1755255,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339483483,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T06:05:21Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:25:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449776,"name":"Janeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janeth is 24 years old and married.

To better feed the family, she also plants red corn and works for others for pay. She has been with her businesses for 10 years and can earn about KHR 8,200 per day. For her, insufficiency of working capital is the main challenge.\r\n\r\nChoeurn has been with VisionFund for two cycles and has successfully paid back the loans. The past loans have helped her have enough food and keep her children in school.

age 56, maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Grace's regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 5,000 Philippine Pesos (PhP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nGrace lives in Cavite City with her husband and business partner Dano. The two of them manage their household together while operating the business. They work hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTo help Grace continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PhP 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nGrace hopes to grow her business and increase her client base in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1140629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

is a vendor selling vegetables in a local market to supplement her husband\u2019s income. Through her effort, Puth hopes to provide opportunities of education to her three dependent children. Puth has been in this business for four years and she is able to earn in the vicinity of KHR 14,000 each day. Puth is now 36 years old and is married to Men, her husband, who works as a paid worker in a plantation and also a tractor operator. \r\n\r\nPuth needs a vehicle to support her selling business. Due to not having one, she has had a lot of expenses in transferring her vegetables to the marketplaces.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"My two brothers and I learned to weave on a traditional loom. I was ten when I began to weave with my father, and I became independent when I was 14. We had small looms made to match our stature, and we used them to weave narrow textiles.

Each of the women is the proprietor of a small business, specializing in weaving, animal husbandry, agriculture and selling food, among other trades. \r\n\r\nAs treasurer, 34-year old Gladys has taken an active role in the success of the Trust Bank. A single mother of two girls who are currently going to school (5th grade and 1st grade), Gladys affirms that the continuation of her girls\u2019 education is very important to her, as she was not able to attend school after 4th grade. Gladys has a great personality; she is fun, happy, and likes to help others and, above all else, she is a hard-working woman who not only sustains herself and her two girls but also her father who is sick. Gladys is involved in animal husbandry, and currently she has ten chickens, one pig and one bull. She has also established a small convenience store where she sells rice, eggs, beans, coffee, snacks, oil, candies, bread and other goods. The store is installed in half of her kitchen, and also she sells portions of food and snacks in the front yard of her house to local residents.  \r\n\r\nWith her previous loans Gladys has been able to increase her inventory, as well as buy her children\u2019s school supplies to ensure that they are able to continue to receive the education that is so important to her. This will be Gladys\u2019s third loan cycle, and she is excited to use the funds to expand her business. She will use the new loan to buy more items for her convenience store, and she also plans to buy two more pigs. When they are not in school, Gladys\u2019 daughters help her with the animals and help her manage her store.\r\n\r\nAs one of the founders of the Flor de Esperanza Trust Bank, Gladys is invested in using her loan to make a better life for herself and her family and ensuring that the other eight women are able to do the same. For that reason, she opens her home every month for the group meeting with Friendship Bridge, where the women receive and participate in educational lessons on business, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, health and how to support their children\u2019s education. These lessons not only provide the women with valuable information regarding their businesses and their families\u2019 health, but also foster a community of support among the women. One member of the group, Sandy, smiles as she says, \"We are thankful for the opportunity of microloans as it helps us to promote our small businesses and improve our quality of life.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1138999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

I loved discovering images in the natural shape of the wood. I think what I like best about my work is how you can make any kind of figure from an ordinary piece of wood. Images from Maya art are the most difficult to do but they're among my favorites. It's interesting to work in a craft that helps keep alive our culture, that of our Maya ancestors and all the animals of our land.

The group has 14 members, four of whom are quite young and unmarried. These four young women did not have the opportunity to complete primary school, but their desire to succeed pushed them to to start their own businesses. Like the other ten women in the group, they strive every day in order to achieve their goals and create better lives for themselves. The businesses that the members of the group are engaged in are varied and include: weaving, embroidering, and animal husbandry, among others.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the Trust Bank, Lucia, is 45 years old and has four children with her husband, Mason. Three of Lucia\u2019s children are still in school, and the other just completed high school. Lucia joined the Nuevo Amanecer Xecam Trust Bank through an invitation from a friend who currently is a FB client. Lucia and her family are dedicated to their animal husbandry business, which includes four pigs and 24 chickens (most of which are roosters). She joined Friendship Bridge so she could expand her business.\r\n\r\nLucia is very excited for the opportunity provided by her Trust Bank and by Friendship Bridge to obtain a loan, which will serve to buy hens. She hopes to take advantage of raising more chickens and selling eggs. Lucia's long-term dream is to obtain her own farm, because she is currently renting. Her short-term goal is to see her second child graduate from high school next year. Through the participatory non-formal education lessons provided by Friendship Bridge at the monthly loan repayment meetings, Lucia has learned how to effectively support her children\u2019s education. She and the other women have also benefited from lessons on business practices, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights and health. These lessons not only provide the women with valuable information regarding their businesses and their families\u2019 health, but also foster a community of support among the women.\r\n\r\nLucia and the other 13 women in the Trust Bank are both surprised and grateful that people from elsewhere have focused their attention on their small village and have given them the opportunity to make their dreams a reality.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":1141114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy hens.

farmer, who used to work as a dispatcher at a collective farm.  She and her husband decided to get involved in farming in the 1990s.  They leased 12 hectares of land, which they work on now.  Evgeniya and her husband grow thistle, pumpkins and flax.  What is noticeable about them is that they have a processing facility, where they make oil from these crops.  The farmer found a market to sell these products in the Crimea.  During the last two years, thanks to the information, provided by the Ukrainian horticultural development project and by public organization, called \"The Union of Women-Farmers\" in the Zaporozhskaya area, Evgeniya started to grow grapes and became interested in growing strawberries.  Her husband, who has worked as a chief engineer at a collective farm, helps her to work on the land.  The family has a grown son, who lives in another region.  He works as an agronomist and can provide his parents with a lot of help through consultations.  Evgeniya is a very active and goal-oriented person.  Despite difficulties that arise, she always strives to move forward.  It is difficult for the majority of small and medium farmers to obtain financing in Ukraine, and interest rates for these loans are very high.  Thanks to the expected loan for soil cover, mulching plastic, pump and a drip irrigation system, Evgeniya can now start planting strawberries according to all of the contemporary requirements.  Evgeniya understands that following all of the agricultural norms is a start to success and getting quality produce.  \n\nEvgeniya tries not to be stagnant and visits various educational events to increase the level of her knowledge.  She dreams of a comfortable home.  She understands that a person's social responsibility is one of the important components of life, and this is why helping the regional village house has a place in her life.  She needs your help to finance a soil cover, mulching plastic, pump and a drip irrigation system, and also espaliers for grape

married and blessed with a child below the age of 15 years, Anastia lives with her family in a two bedroom house located at Nkwen quarters of the North West Region of Cameroon.\n\nLots of challenges have been encountered by this lady, such as the lack of adequate finance to start up a business, low incomes within the family, making it difficult to even take care of some basic needs, and not having a proper education as she dropped out of school due to lack of school fees. The death of her elder brother further compounded the situation. However, joining GHAPE in 2010 made her see light on the horizon due to their numerous offers like cheap and affordable business financing, loan payment duration, training in life skills and business\/marketing techniques.\n\nThe loan is going to assist her to expand her business as she will add the quantity of all the food items in her catering business by buying wheat in bags, beans in bags and vegetable oil in tins. She will repair her dilapidated structure and buy new chairs and more plates and cups, as well as generally increasing the food items. Her activity will help the community in which she operates since it is a business district. The business will succeed because of the high demand from the workers around this business zone. The profits will be used to assist her husband in improving their housing situation, provide better health care for her family and also increase the size of her restaurant. She is positive about the whole venture.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1136169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for

Her business is profitable because she constantly has customers and her products are well-known in the region.  She is happy with how things are going as it allows her to be home and care for her young son, whom she loves a lot, and the income she generates helps them pay their household expenses.  The problem is that when there are heavy rains it is difficult to make any sales, but this doesn't discourage her.  She has plans to continue growing her business and to open a store to sell snacks and groceries.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan from MFP.  With this loan she will be able to meet her objectives.
