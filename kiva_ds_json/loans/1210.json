And it is not only in Kyrgyzstan; it is all over the world. Millions of smart brains stay in the shade, and only some of them can reach to the light. Unfortunately, not many of us were lucky to be born into a family which can afford a high level of life style. In fact, statistically teenagers from poor families can reach many more achievements because they were taught to survive hardship since they were kids. If they get an opportunity, they do a lot to make it happen. \n\nI have chosen the American University of Central Asia so I can best apply the knowledge that I have gained so far. I was born to be a leader. The fact that I am the president of our class increases my chance of studying in such a university. I am a debater and experienced that during the last year. I also take part at Tech Age Girls program under IREX. This program gave me a lot of basic knowledge in IT resources. I also became more independent and democratic.  Thus, I would surely say that I could contribute a lot to the social life of the University as well.\n\nThe only problem is that my family is not able to pay the whole amount of the tuition fees, which is the reason that I am applying for a Kiva loan. \nI hope that I will get such an opportunity and I am ready for the challenge of a new environment. I am ready to devote myself to studies and to the social life of the AUCA. It is my firm belief that I can make a huge contribution to the economy of Kyrgyzstan.

This is her story:\n\nMy name is Zhamilia. I have graduated from high school this year and enrolled at the American University of Central Asia. I am applying for a Kiva loan to be able to cover my tuition fees. A Kiva loan gives an opportunity to people like me to pursue education at AUCA or other Universities. Lack of money impedes the process of education since you start thinking only about the money you have to pay; consequently, problems in studies occur. It is hard for my parents to cover tuition fees for three children and I would therefore like to take the opportunity that AUCA gives to its students and apply for a Kiva loan.  \n\nSince I was in ninth grade, I have dreamed about entering the best University not only in Kyrgyzstan, but in all of Central Asia. So, I have chosen AUCA because its unique features will guarantee me an opportunity to reach my learning goals. Also, educational instruction is given in English. From childhood, I have always liked this language and the chance to study in English would be magnificent. I have a keen interest in studying Journalism and Mass Communications because I have a big interest in photography and writing. I realized what field I wanted to study last year and had an immense desire to become part of JMC department at AUCA, and my dream came true.\n\nAUCA gives the best education in Central Asia. I will be able to help not only my family, but also my country while becoming a good specialist of the area that I have chosen. I am very enthusiastic about volunteering, which became an excitement when I first did community service in the USA. Comparing my country to others, I see that our economics are so weak and I would like to bring a change and give better conditions to my descendants. \nI will highly appreciate your assistance and want you to believe in my abilities because I always try my best in everything.

is a student at the American University of Central Asia (AUCA). This is her story:\n\nMy name is Anastasia. It is my dream to study at AUCA, in the Journalism and Mass Communication Department. I enrolled in the AUCA Department of JMC this year and feel very excited about that. Attending the university in this program is the first step towards my future career as a reporter. I have dreamt of being in the field of Journalism since I saw TV news for the first time. AUCA is the best place to get higher education in the area of Mass Media because of the high quality of education and it is a chance to meet and interact with people from all over the world. \n\nI have always maintained excellent records whether it is academic activities in school or some competitions. Sports taught me not to give up, but I am quite confused about my expectations because of financial matters. So I would like to apply for financial support to AUCA.\n\nI am applying for a Kiva loan as my family cannot afford to fully cover the tuition fees. We have thought about AUCA since the first time we heard about it from our acquaintance. My parents saved money for my future education. Time has elapsed but our funds are not very big because of appropriate outcomes. Our family consists of four people: my parents, grandmother, and I. Only my mother has a permanent job but it is not a full time job, and the income varies. My father is a seasonal worker, so his income depends on certain seasons. I am a schoolgirl.  I could earn extra money, but this way I would have less time for studies and would not keep up with my class. All I can do now is to get good knowledge that will help me in my future. \n\nI will take part in all AUCA extracurricular activities with alacrity in which my participation can contribute to something useful for the university.

She previously accessed a 15,000 PHP loan that she used to buy spare parts, accessories and y for the maintenance of their jeepney unit. Her earnings were a big help in their personal, house hold and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan for her to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of their jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nCrisales hopes to have another unit of jeepney and dreams that her children will finish their studies. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work. At the meetings, she can also draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\nFootnote: Interestingly, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

On average they are 40 years old with three children. They all live in the village of N'djebougouni in the Segou region (the fourth administrative region of Mali) and met through neighbourhood activities, family, and their business contacts in the village. They sell rice, Shea butter, groundnuts, and children's clothing. Hoping to increase their trade, the members of the group decided to join Soro Yiriwaso and this is their second solidarity loan.

Posteriormente, su hija se marcha a la  escuela por la tarde y Elsys se prepara para reunirse a las 2 p.m.  en el curso de alfabetizaci\u00f3n que imparte un vecino de ella.     \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar herbicidas, plaguicidas para curar le semilla al momento de la siembra, 3 sacos de fertilizantes y pagar algunos d\u00edas de trabajo a jornales que ocupara para la limpia de terreno y  la siembra que sera en terreno de ladera bajo el sistema de labranza m\u00ednimo, y luego si  la temporada de lluvias es constante y se pueda cosechar se trasladara el grano hasta su casa donde se almacenara. \n\nLa cantidad a cultivar son 7,000 metros cuadrados de ma\u00edz en la propiedad de unos familiares.  La idea de hacer esto es para tener materia prima para la venta de tortillas y no comprar el ma\u00edz que muchas veces es escaso y caro en la comunidad. \n\n\n","en":"Elsys is 32 years old, in a relationship, and has a 14 year old daughter. She lives together with her daughter and life partner in her humble bahareque house. She is dedicated to selling tortillas and her partner works as a laborer in the community and at night spends his free time collecting firewood for the tortilla factory. Elsys makes the tortillas on a wood stove (burner). She did not study in her childhood or adolescence, but she took a literacy course in her community and shares that she is learning to read and write.\n\nThe business consists of preparing and selling tortillas. She sells them to her neighbors and some employees that work at a poultry farm.\n\nShe buys 30 lbs of corn from the earnings of one day to prepare for the next day. She wakes up at 4:30 am lighting the stove and begins to cook the corn, all while preparing the breakfast for her partner so that he can go to work. Later, she collects water from a well to wash the corn, and at 6 am every day, she begins to grind the corn. She prepares the tortillas very early. Her daughter helps her with household chores and is responsible for delivering tortillas to the homes of some clients around noon. Then, her daughter walks to school in the afternoon, and Elsys prepares to go to her literacy class at 2 pm that is taught by a neighbor of hers.\n\nThe loan that she is seeking from Fundacion Campo is to buy herbicides, pesticides to cure the seeds at the moment they are planted, 3 sacks of fertilizer, and to pay laborers for some days of work to prepare the terrain and to plant on a hillside, which does not require much tilling.  If there is a consistent rainy season they will harvest the crop and transport the grain to their house where they store it.  \n\nThey grow 7,000 square meters of corn on the property of one of her relatives. The idea is to grow the raw materials for the tortilla business because it is very expensive to buy them in the community.  \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":133.16,"image":{"id":1416588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"para comprar herbicidas, plaguicidas para curar le semilla al momento de la siembra, 3 sacos de fertilizantes y pagar algunos d\u00edas de trabajo a  jornales que ocupara para la limpia de terreno y  la siembra que sera en terreno de ladera bajo el sistema de labranza m\u00ednimo.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-11T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-11T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsys Nohemy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":33.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":36.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":38.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":39.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.99,"local_amount":31.99,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:51Z","rounded_local_amount":31.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090872,"comment":null},{"amount":33.23,"local_amount":33.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":33.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856867,"comment":null},{"amount":34.6,"local_amount":34.6,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":34.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505138,"comment":null},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":33.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":33.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716216,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T14:59:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599310,"name":"Mar\u00eda Santos Gloria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda cuenta con 38 a\u00f1os de edad, su grado de escolaridad lleg\u00f3 hasta  educaci\u00f3n media,tiene 4 hijos de 27,20,16 y 13 a\u00f1os de edad; pero solo 3 viven con ella.

Rusudan works as a saleswoman in a clothing store and gets a small monthly income. Her husband and son-in-law are construction workers and work on special orders. The existing funds are very small and hardly enough for covering expenses, so Rusudan decided to start a grocery store to increase the family income, but she needs financial support to implement her plan. Unfortunately, Rusudan lacks access to financial institutions to obtain credit to start a business, as they require a stable income and business experience. She received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo--the start-up program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of USD 1,900, Rusudan will purchase basic groceries to set up a grocery store. She will take care of her clients and treat them in a kind and friendly way. Her daughters will assist her running the business. With this credit, she expects to improve her income and increase the turnover gradually. Rusudan will work hard to tackle her financial difficulties and make her repayments on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":236.72,"image":{"id":1426069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Artur has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nThis loan is very important for Artur to be able to improve his car and continue the business.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1424476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to pay for vehicle repair and exterior design of the car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Masis","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-09-11T23:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-11T23:20:10Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Artur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":270000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":9355.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":9627.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":9398.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":10147},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":9944.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9987.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10562.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10509.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10383.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10996.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10981.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10910.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":11378.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":11473.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":11521.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":11869.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":11940},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":12122.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":12421.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":12497.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":12663.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":12921.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":13092.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":13293.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604323,"name":"Enkhbolor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Enkhbolor is 30 years old and lives with his wife and children in Kherlen, the eastern-most town of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nHe has worked as crane operator at a mining company for two years.

began his business, Peralez Trucking and Construction, eight months ago just outside the Brownsville, Texas, area.  \n\nEver since he could work, Patricio always worked for his father, transporting rock, dirt, concrete and other building materials to work sites where his father installs septic tanks. But this familiar business wasn\u2019t just a job to him; it provided a living.\n\nIn early 2013, Patricio\u2019s father helped him purchase a truck to help with the hauling. As his father saw the entrepreneurial spirit in his son, he passed the truck ownership to Patricio to form his own trucking and construction business.\n\nThe money Patricio saved from working with his father wasn\u2019t enough to maintain the truck, keep the tank full, properly operate his business and purchase what he needs before bidding on projects. \n\nSeeing his struggle, his sister, a current Accion Texas Inc. borrower, recommended that Patricio visit the nonprofit microlender to inquire about applying for a loan. After Patricio applied and received approval, he quickly used the money for start-up and fuel costs, and regular maintenance for his truck. The Accion loan allowed Patricio to further his trucking and construction business and be competitive in his field. He is also now able to compete for larger projects in the Rio Grande Valley area.\n\nAs Patricio continues to bid for local work, he\u2019s planning his next goal, which is to hire subcontractors to assist with the workload.\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1407382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to pay start-up and fuel costs, and provide regular maintenance for his truck.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Brownsville, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604776,"name":"Cherilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cherilyn is 41 years old.

She sells pan, tobacco nuts, tobacco leaves, cigarettes, local cigarettes, sachet shampoo, sweets, candies, detergent soap, detergent powder, etc. She says, village farmers usually stop at her shop to buy pan and cigarettes to take them to their field, and  while returning from the fields they stop again for pan and cigarettes. Agui shares that villagers love chewing pan and smoking cigarettes as it is affordable for all. \r\n\r\nShe wants a loan from Kiva to get more stock for her shop. The present income is insufficient to get abundant supplies as she also shares family financial problems. Therefore she is planning to get more supplies like bathing soap and more pan items like tobacco nuts and leaves. She has plans to expand her pan shop into a grocery shop in the future. The lack of a big grocery shop in the village creates lots of hassles for the villagers as they had to travel to the main town market for grocery items. She is happy that her plans will be fulfilled and thanks Kiva and WSDS for the support.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in running tea-stalls, selling chives, weaving and farming."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1422991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase supplies for her shop and expand the shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bishnupur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T13:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T13:10:01Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Achuiliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khangamlu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charinlu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Percy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jangamliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guangthuilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ajailiu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apanliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dihni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aguilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Athai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chamlangliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T08:18:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604786,"name":"Rengsai Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In autumn, these ten hard working tribal women formed a group called Rengsai.

She is a mother to two children. Her husband is a private school teacher in the village. Being in a private school, he does not get a salary regularly and therefore could not meet the family's needs. Hence, in order to eradicate the worries of the family, Gailunei opened a variety shop in the village. \r\n\r\nShe keeps tobaccos, chips, soap, salt, candle sticks, matches and some daily essential products in her shop. Through the loan she avails from Kiva, she plans to expand the shop as well as store enough stock so that the shop will never run out of stock even during general strikes and economic blockades. \r\n\r\nShe also wishes to raise her two children by sending them to good school and providing them quality education. Her children are her source of inspiration. She appreciates WDSD\/Kiva for being gracious to her and the group.   \r\n\r\nThe rest of the women are engaged in weaving, ginger plantation and vegetable cultivation to generate more income.

The irregular power supply in the town also gives an advantage to her shop, as she uses an external power generator to run the shop. She also sells eatables in the shop. The meagre income generated by her husband from farming is insufficient and, therefore, she also bears most of the household expenses for the family. During off-season, her husband usually helps her in the shop by getting all required items, such as petrol and printing papers, from the main market.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, she will purchase good quality ink cartridges and get the Xerox machine serviced for better results.

Her family is made up of her three children and her partner. She finished four years of school. Her partner is a farmer, and she is both a farmer and a homemaker. Her parents taught her how to work the land from a very young age. Antonia has worked growing coffee and malanga [a starchy tuberous plant] for more than twelve years. Her customers are neighbors, family members and different coffee buyers that come to the area. Antonia owns the land that she farms, thanks to a bank that gave her the opportunity to buy it. Her fields are 10 minutes from her home, and they can be reached on foot or by car.\r\n\r\nAntonia is requesting this loan from Kiva and the field partner to buy fertilizers, manure and other supplies to maintain a healthy coffee crop, and to protect it from pests, insects and other threats.\r\n\r\nAntonia says that her goal is to be one of the best coffee producers in the area, and that she wants to attract more customers by adding more varieties and improving quality. She hopes to finish making repairs to her home, which has a partially deteriorated roof and needs plastering. Antonia says her dream is to give her children a better quality of life. She hopes to save enough to send them to university, so that they can study to become professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2.36,"image":{"id":1427240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers, manure and other supplies to maintain a healthy coffee crop, and to protect it from pests, insects and other threats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2.31,"local_amount":46.17,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":47.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833751,"comment":null},{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":0.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042212,"comment":null},{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":0.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710553,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T03:45:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605705,"name":"Maria Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Rosario  vive en la ciudad de Paucartambo, ella es una persona  trabajadora y emprendedora que saca adelante a su familia con el esfuerzo de su trabajo entonces su actividad econ\u00f3mica principal es ense\u00f1ar pues es profesora y trabaja en uno de los colegios de la ciudad donde vive, ella es una persona responsable por ese motivo le invitaron a participar en el banco comunal \u201cCamino al Progreso\u201d y en esta oportunidad  requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para uso personal pues va pagar la luz y la agua de su casa, ella agradece y valora el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas mensuales con mucha responsabilidad.","en":"Mar\u00eda Rosario lives in the city of Paucartambo.

She returned home with her child and took shelter at her parents' home. Neighbouring friends asked her to join the group to give her a purpose and she started selling vegetables with her previous loan. Gradually, she started earning more, and now she runs a variety shop. \r\n\r\nThe shop is located at the centre point of the public transport parking lot in the village. Hard-working Hellut sells bathing soap, detergent soap, detergent powder, tobacco leaves, tobacco nuts, sweets, candies, chips, small-sized packet juice, etc. Her main source of income is the shop, so she gives her heart and soul to make this a successful business for her. She generally gets the supplies from the main market and sells them in the village at a little higher rate. Passengers waiting at the parking lot buy from her shop as it is easily accessible and that is again profitable for her business. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more supplies for the shop and could sell them during strikes and bandhs (protests). She says the place where they live is prone to curfews and economic blockades wherein supplies to sell are short. She is happy that Kiva could be of help in this situation and make her believe in herself once more. She says, \u201cThank you so much, Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in pineapple-farming, poultry and vegetable-selling businesses. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1425854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase supplies for the shop, sell them and earn more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T14:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T14:50:10Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khupoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aning","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Achim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sangponing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Athei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T12:02:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604905,"name":"Melba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melba is 38 years old, married, and has four children, two of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nMelba is in the agricultural business, farming vegetables in the Philippines.

She is engaged in a tailoring business and the town also acknowledges her work. Total dependence on her husband's income would surely bring them a huge debt with children's education fees and other expenses. She shares the family expenses by generating extra income from tailoring mosquito nets. \r\n\r\nManaging family expenses and efficiently running the business is not easy with little profits. Demand is high but sometimes she fails to supply because she can't afford the capital expenditure to purchase a the whole roll of the cloth to make the nets. Customers usually bring the cloth material to stitch when she can't provide it. Then she gets paid only for the labour she spends on tailoring. This is the biggest drawback in her business and she is determined to overcome this issue.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase cloth material in bulk and sew the nets. All the generated income will be accounted as hers. That way, she has more opportunities to expand her business. She will repay the loan on time and will surely expand her business and earn more income. She aspires to own a more advanced sewing machine in the future and also to hire an assistant to efficiently run the business. She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful work and says she will always remain grateful.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in piggery, selling ice cream, and grocery, pharmacy and vegetable businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1425063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase cloth materials for sewing mosquito nets and earning more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T15:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T15:10:22Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Momoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimjoujam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhochong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimsy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoipi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T21:45:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":604897,"name":"Jenelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenelyn is 24 years old with one child who is in school.
