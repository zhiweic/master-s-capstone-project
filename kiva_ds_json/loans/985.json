Her daily activities revolve around preparing food for the family, feeding her piglets and weaving traditional shawls, her main source of income, during the day and at night when all the children are asleep. She devotes her time carefully and works hard, as she tries to earn as much as she can since two of her children are attending school and she needs to be able to pay for her husband\u2019s medical expenses. Her husband who was a carpenter is now disabled (paralysis from hip down) and bedridden. Because of this unforeseen misfortune, she has been carrying the added responsibility both as a wife and the role of the father to meet the household requirements alone. \r\n\r\nFrom the first loan of INR 5000 from WSDS, she bought two piglets for rearing and thread for weaving. She managed to repay her loan by selling the finished traditional shawls and wrap-around skirts that she wove. She was also able to clear all her other family expenses like her children's school fees, medical expenses, etc. by selling the full grown pigs at the end of the year. \r\n\r\nNow, she is requesting a KIVA loan of INR 10,000 so that she can buy two more piglets @ INR 2500 per piglet for breeding purposes, repairing and extending her pigsty, and utilise INR 2000 for purchasing thread for weaving.\r\n\r\nThe other group members have similar activities like Pi Nemneichong and among them two members have grocery shops in the village. Most of them have a ginger cum vegetable farm in the upland 'jhum' fields. They grow vegetables both for household consumption as well as for selling in the market. However, the cultivation of ginger is mainly for selling; it is harvested once a year, depending on market demand.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1221284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy two piglets for breeding, thread for weaving and to repair her pigsty.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-03T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-03T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nemneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhailam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahlam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veijahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengjaphal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhinglam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neilhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimbong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongjahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rohnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-05T04:03:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":488314,"name":"Ny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ny is 51 years old.

Currently the beauty stock of the salon is almost finished therefore Naseem wants to purchase cosmetic products to continue her business. For that as a member of 9-person lending group she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase beauty products like facial creams, lipstick, scrubs, makeup kits, hair colors and some other variety of products. With the profit she will extend her business more by opening one more beauty salon. \r\n\r\nShe dreams to live a happy healthy and peaceful life with her family. Many thanks best wishes to all staff of Kiva and BRAC Pakistan from her.

She\u2019s a widow but lives with her children in her own house she built with much effort and dedication.  She strives daily from there to provide the best for her children so that they will be happy people in the future.  \r\n\r\nDoris\u2019 work consists in manufacturing charcoal.  She leases space in a field that\u2019s in a far distant part of the city that is set aside for this type of function and she works there every day.  Her work consists in buying discarded pieces of wood from nearby sawmills.  She then installs artisanal ovens she puts the acquired wood into and covers it with sawdust.  Then she lights it and waits a few weeks for the wood to reach its optimum baking stage and become charcoal.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this business more than three years and she states that it\u2019s very hard but profitable work.  She has help from three day laborers and occasionally her son-in-law helps her too.  On the other hand, she also sells food from home in the evening.  She likes her work because she\u2019s able to work and feel useful for her family.  It pleases her to feel that she has much more to give for others and if this weren\u2019t enough she insists that dealing with people directly is what she most likes to do.  Fortunately, she does well because she always obtains a good production and this helps her to increase profits so she hopes her business will maintain this same pace of progress.\r\n\r\nThis is her 6th MFP loan and she\u2019s very happy with the financial support she\u2019s getting because she\u2019ll feel confident about making progress with her work.  She\u2019s very happy to belong to her communal bank because they are all very responsible and mutually supportive.

She\u2019s set aside space in a field in a faraway part of the city that has been ceded for this purpose and she works there every day.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for a year.  She does it in the afternoons because she works in a sawmill in the morning and that\u2019s precisely where she gets the discarded wood she needs to make the charcoal.\r\n\r\nShe started this business because she saw that the wood discarded by her sawmill was being wasted and this was how she decided to put it to use and take advantage of every last bit of wood residue.  She works with help from a day laborer and her spouse.  Occasionally she also sells fruit on the weekend or when she has free time.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she can work pressure-free and generate her own income.  It pleases her to feel that she has much more to offer workwise and if that weren\u2019t enough she insists that dealing directly with people is what she likes the most.  Fortunately, she does well because she always obtains good production which helps her increase profits.  She hopes her business will continue with the same rate of progress.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd MFP loan and she\u2019s very happy with the financial support she\u2019s getting because she\u2019ll feel more confident about making progress with her work.  On the other hand, she commits to make her installment payments punctually as scheduled.  She\u2019s very happy to be part of her communal bank because they are all very responsible and mutually supportive.  She will use the requested 1000 soles to buy sawdust, sacks and other supplies she needs for her work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1224824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy sawdust, sacks and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-03T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-03T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tereza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":152.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":158.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":164.22},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":165.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":176.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":182.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.38,"local_amount":310.95,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":321.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053763,"comment":null},{"amount":65.69,"local_amount":164.22,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":169.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188695,"comment":null},{"amount":66.14,"local_amount":165.36,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":170.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572607,"comment":null},{"amount":70.61,"local_amount":176.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":182.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122266,"comment":null},{"amount":73.18,"local_amount":182.95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":189.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868087,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-13T22:10:25Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":488517,"name":"07.04.75 Ph\u00fa S\u01a1n Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. S\u01a1n operates a food stall\/restaurant selling fruit.

She wants to buy another buffalo so she requested a loan of Rs.25,000, which will help her increase the milk supply in her town. She is happy to be able to provide her family a living standard that she thought she had lost forever.

Each day, she is able to earn approximately 10,000 KHR and manages to save around 4,000 KHR after meeting her daily living costs. This will be Ait\u2019s third loan from VisionFund, Kiva\u2019s partner. The previous loans she received helped her improve her daily livelihood, which made her very happy. Now she is leading a women's group formed with a second-time VisionFund borrower to take out loans of 1,200,000 KHR each. Ait will spend most of her requested portion of the loan on fertilizer for her farmland, and she will also use some of the loan to buy household supplies. Her only hope in the future is to be able to produce plentiful yields of good quality crops, so that she can boost her income and use the income to support her beloved family.

They live in different areas of the city of Cuenca. This city has a cold climate, and since December 1999, it has been classified as part of Cultural Heritage of Mankind. The city has four rivers and great places to enjoy nature. All of the members are hard-working, some have their own businesses and others work as private employees. However, all of them have the same  goal, which is to improve the quality of life of their homes and move their families forward. They are proud to maintain the culture and traditions that their parents have instilled in them.\r\n\r\nOne of the group's members is Mar\u00eda Micaela. She has been part of the communal bank for six years and lives in the Parrish of Paccha in Cuenca. She is 42 years old, married, and has three children who are 14, 12, and 5 years old. Her first two daughters go to school and her son goes to the kindergarden  in the area. Her husband works as a private employee. The house they live in is the fruit of their marriage's work.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Micaela works in various economic activities since she is an enterprising woman. She has had a store for five months. On the weekends, she sells \"hornado\" and \"cascaritas,\" which are typical Ecuadorian dishes. At home, she also raises pigs, Guinea pigs, and chickens to sell in the community. She works in agriculture and what she harvests is only used for household consumption.  \r\n\r\nShe is going to invest in buying more supplies to have more stock in her store. Her goal is to expand her store. \r\n\r\nThe two small photos represent the three members who were not present when the group photo was taken.

Together they have five children.  Now they live in an adobe house that is their own property.  For ten years she has made a living by producing cocoa, and thanks to the type of soil her land has, which is very fertile, it has given her good production results.  She feels very pleased with her work and being able to smell the cocoa beans kept in a small store that she set up in her house, so this motivates her to keep working.  On the other hand, during the last cocoa harvesting season there was a small percentage of cocoa that she did not manage to sell because she detected a disease known as \"escoba de bruja\" (Witch's Broom, which is caused by a fungus) that ruined some plants.  Given this, she needs them to be replaced.  Therefore she has planned to plant cacao trees.  \r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan and she is already very happy with this new loan opportunity because, as always, it allows her to make a good investment to the benefit of her and her family.  On the other hand, she says that she feels very committed to her communal bank and the decisions they make.  Thanks to the loan for 2,000 soles she will acquire cocoa seedling plants and sacks of organic fertilizer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1226326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cocoa seedlings and sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-04T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-04T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":198.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":235.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":230.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":251.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":259.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":268.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":272.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":284.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.81,"local_amount":198.21,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":198.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053780,"comment":null},{"amount":91.41,"local_amount":235.91,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:49Z","rounded_local_amount":236.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188712,"comment":null},{"amount":89.35,"local_amount":230.57,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":230.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572622,"comment":null},{"amount":97.36,"local_amount":251.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":251.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122283,"comment":null},{"amount":100.57,"local_amount":259.54,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:07Z","rounded_local_amount":259.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868104,"comment":null},{"amount":103.88,"local_amount":268.08,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":268.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576935,"comment":null},{"amount":105.5,"local_amount":272.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":272.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529269,"comment":null},{"amount":110.12,"local_amount":284.18,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":284.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974405,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T16:20:43Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492122,"name":"Moussiliate","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9e de 30ans, Moussiliate est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de quatre enfants scolaris\u00e9s.

As a group leader, Saran will use her  loan portion as working capital so that she has enough money needed to run her new business, which is a pig-raising business.

Lali works hard to do her best for her family.\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan for harvesting cabbages (paying the workforce and transportation). The harvested cabbages will be sold, and this will significantly increase the family income. With the increased income, Lali will improve the living conditions for the family. She awaits your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1226040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to cover the costs of harvesting the cabbage crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ruisi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-11-04T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-04T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.58},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":167.58,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:00:16Z","rounded_local_amount":277.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565825,"comment":null},{"amount":807.42,"local_amount":1325,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1339.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115400,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T18:10:22Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:22:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":490280,"name":"Guillermina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Guillermina de 58 a\u00f1os, es viuda.
