Nos comenta que le gustan muchos los ni\u00f1os, sobre todo en tan corta edad ya que es en la etapa primaria donde se crean las bases de su formaci\u00f3n como adulto. Da clases en una escuela particular por su domicilio a ni\u00f1os de primero de b\u00e1sica. Tambi\u00e9n da clases de nivelaci\u00f3n en su domicilio por las tardes cobrando $ 3.00 la hora, le va bien porque hay ni\u00f1os que sus padres trabajan y no los pueden ayudar con las tareas. En la actualidad lo que le hace falta es una computadora porque hay ni\u00f1os que necesitan aprender a usarla por eso solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de una. Erika es una profesora muy entregada a su profesi\u00f3n y nos menciona que su mayor sue\u00f1o es poder tener una escuela propia.","en":"Erika lives in her own home in Duran.  It\u2019s a two story cement house that includes basic services.   It does not include sewage nor paved roads, but she likes the neighborhood because it\u2019s quiet and includes excellent neighbors.  At age 30, Erika is single and has no children.  She is a teacher and tells us that she likes children very much, especially during the early stages of their lives where they form the basis of their adulthood.  She teaches basic and elementary education at a private school near her home.  She also does tutoring in her home, charging $3.00 per hour.  Things are going well for her because there are parents who work and are unable to help their children with their homework.  She needs a computer because the children need to learn how to use one.  Erika is a teacher who is very dedicated to her profession and tells us that her greatest dream is having her own school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1112060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"to buy a computer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Duran (Primavera)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T14:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T14:00:08Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1049.27,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75.77},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":102.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.82,"local_amount":75.77,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":75.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287211485,"comment":null},{"amount":79.05,"local_amount":78.99,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":79.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294286801,"comment":null},{"amount":80.13,"local_amount":80.08,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":80.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340358,"comment":null},{"amount":81.97,"local_amount":81.91,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":81.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096731,"comment":null},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":84.31,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":84.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331086,"comment":null},{"amount":85.76,"local_amount":85.7,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":85.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939729,"comment":null},{"amount":88.13,"local_amount":88.07,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:37Z","rounded_local_amount":88.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072150,"comment":null},{"amount":89.72,"local_amount":89.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":89.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318509,"comment":null},{"amount":91.78,"local_amount":91.71,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":91.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013255,"comment":null},{"amount":293.27,"local_amount":293.07,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":293.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453620,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-08T18:14:32Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":434773,"name":"Narcisa Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Narcisa tiene 40 a\u00f1os viviendo en Playas y se dedica a su tienda de abarrotes ubicada en su domicilio.

She and her husband, Fernando, a painter, have 4 children, all in local public schools.  The oldest are 15- and 11-years old, respectively.  The two youngest, twins, are 7-years old.  Narcisa tells us that she started her business selling copy services.  She had bought a computer and printer and her customers--mostly local students--bought scanned copies of their documents from her.  She then realized that she could expand the business by stocking school supplies.  She didn't have a lot of money to invest in inventory, though, so she approached us for her first loan.  In addition to selling school supplies, she now has a general store and tells us that she is happy with her progress.  She works every day, from 7:00 in the morning to 11:00 at night, and still finds time to take care of her family.  She sells school supplies and groceries--rice, sugar, cooking oil, cleaning products, toiletries and other household supplies--that she buys with the money she borrows.  Her plan is to set up a shop large enough for both businesses because they are separate now and the general store is not easy to reach from the street.  She wants to grow the business so that she can help her children in every way that she can.

The reason why he decided to join Ruma\u2019s Loket Ruma bill-payment business is because he sees the demand especially to pay electricity bills and landline phone bills. \r\n\r\nRuslan is married and has three children who are 27, 20, and 7 years old. With this loan he wants to expand his business. By becoming a Loket Ruma agent, people will come to his counter and pay their bills or buy prepaid electricity vouchers.\r\n\r\nThis loan is going to be used to pay the deposit for an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) machine. All the payment transactions will use the EDC machine to process everything. Above all, Ruslan\u2019s goal is to generate more profit from his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1111558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for a deposit on an electronic data capture (EDC) machine for his bill payment business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cibubur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruslan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":3000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3072680,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172427,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-08T22:38:07Z","paid_date":"2013-03-18T09:09:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":434789,"name":"Orlandine","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Orlandine tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al lado de su esposa y su peque\u00f1a hija de tan solo 5 a\u00f1os de edad y por la cual trabaja muy duro cada d\u00eda para darle una vida digna y sobre todo que sea feliz.

At 46 years old, she is a breadmaker; she learned the business from her husband, who taught her. Seven years ago they saved enough money and opened the bakery, which is located in their home. When they started out, they bought a secondhand oven, but currently have a new one. She starts making bread with her husband\u2019s help at 3am and finishes at 2pm, but then the selling begins. Rosario tells us that they give work to a few young people who go around their area to sell.That way, they improve their sales without having to wait for customers; this has proven very useful and generates more earnings. With the loan she is requesting, she\u2019ll buy a glass showcase, flour, yeast and eggs to make bread. In the future, she\u2019d like to renovate the bakery by adding cement walls to improve how it looks and buy a kneading machine to help in the elaboration of the

Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, she was not able to study to become a secretary, which she would have liked to have done.  But her dream is to be able to do this someday.  In her spare time, she enjoys playing volleyball with her friends and neighbors, and at times she enjoys cooking the delicious \"arroz con pato\" (rice with duck) to pamper her partner.\r\n\r\nThanks to her enterprising spirit and the support of her husband, Maria started up a small ceviche restaurant more than 3 years ago, where she sells ceviche and chilcano (a cocktail made with the Peruvian brandy called Pisco).  She and her husband get up very early to make all of the preparations and get ready to serve their customers.  She works in the business for about 7 hours a day, during which time she is able to serve about 50 customers.  Maria believes that her business is doing well because her business is well-known and is recommended by her customers because of the tasty food and friendly service.\r\n\r\nMaria is grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help that they are providing she will be able to purchase tables, chairs and a canopy, in this way better equipping her business so that she will be able to tend to a greater number of customers and increase her income.

She and her husband have three sales points: one in Znamenka and two and Kamenka. Olga has been in this business for 11 years already.

Then over time she was getting customers who were satisfied with the dishes she prepared.  She took the profits and invested in her general store to make it more sustainable.  Her children help her in the business and she sells her products from her home.\r\n\r\nShe rises very early to get her business going.  Her husband helps her with the household expenses working as a tailor and tending a farm located near their community.

He is a farmer who has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last 18 years. Over the years, Qara gained enough skills and experience to run a business. He chose this crop business because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. \r\n\r\nPeople use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made with vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits serve every family's table in Azerbaijan and are also used to make fresh punch. Qara usually sells his crops in the central bazaar.

Su meta es organizarlo mejor, para brindar un ambiente confortable a su clientela; as\u00ed mismo quiere aumentar sus inventarios para estabilizar un poco el incremento de los precios de los insumos, comprando por volumen y de contado, pero su capital de trabajo no es suficiente para lograrlo. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante la cual comprar\u00e1 v\u00edveres, como aceite, arroz, carnes, huevos y legumbres, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n utensilios de cocina, sillas y mesas,  con el fin de aumentar sus posibilidades de acceso a nuevos clientes. Su inversi\u00f3n de credikiva ser\u00e1 exitosa, porque ganar\u00e1 el descuento de los art\u00edculos en doble v\u00eda, por su compra en vol\u00famenes y porque no se somete en el periodo, al constante aumento de precios; adem\u00e1s porque brindarle un ambiente confortable y bien presentado a sus clientes  potencializa el aumento del n\u00famero de ellos, lo que en resumes es el objetivo  de Hersilia. ","en":"Hersilia is a 64-year-old woman who has been employed in a restaurant for 25 years. However, being an independent and free spirit, she decided to start her own activity, and she therefore put all of her experience in opening her own restaurant in order to independently make a living. For this activity she had to face many challenges, notably her old age and the loss of her eldest son who died in an accident, but she succeeded in saving some money she used to buy and sell various products, even thought she lost these products because she was robbed. Knowing this, a good neighbor of hers helped her by lending her a small amount of money and by initially managing the set up of her activity in a park by selling soups, while Hersilia was contracting the necessary licenses to work there. Thanks to this activity, that has grown little by little until becoming a restaurant, she succeeded in paying for the education of her 5 children, aged between 31 and 38. Her goal is to better organize her restaurant, in order to offer a comfortable environment to her customers; she also wants to increase her inventory to stabilize a little the rise in the price of the ingredients, by buying in larger volumes and paying cash, but she does not have enough working capital. This is the reason why she is asking for a loan; this is the first loan she requests to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and she will use it to buy provisions such as oil, rice, meat, eggs and pulses, as well as cooking tools, chairs and tables in order to give access to more customers. Her investment in this loan will be successful because she will gain a discount in two ways: by buying in larger volumes on one side and by not giving way to the constant rise in prices on the other; on top of this, by offering a comfortable and pleasant environment to her customers she will capitalize on the increase in the number of customers, which in the end is Hersilia\u2019s objective."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1109067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy provisions such as oil, rice, meat, and eggs, as well as cooking tools, chairs and tables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T17:00:06Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hersilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71617},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74844},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76590},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78377},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80206},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82077},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83993},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85952},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87958},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90010},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":92111},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96265}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.39,"local_amount":71617,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":72082.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338881,"comment":null},{"amount":41.16,"local_amount":74844,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":75330.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395433,"comment":null},{"amount":42.13,"local_amount":76590,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":77087.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775222,"comment":null},{"amount":43.11,"local_amount":78377,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":78886.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387217,"comment":null},{"amount":44.11,"local_amount":80206,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":80727.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994058,"comment":null},{"amount":45.14,"local_amount":82077,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":82610.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130421,"comment":null},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":83993,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84538.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519298,"comment":null},{"amount":92.93,"local_amount":168958,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":170056.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527195,"comment":null},{"amount":92.89,"local_amount":168897,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":169994.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927977,"comment":null},{"amount":62.94,"local_amount":114441,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":115184.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817588,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-15T21:05:13Z","paid_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435030,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Among the possible explanations for this are some that say it derives from a comment made by an Englishman: \"Talca parece Londres\" (which, in Spanish, sounds like \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\", meaning \"Talca resembles London\"). Indeed, in the winter, an abundant fog often blankets the city, as happens in the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1112771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy charcoal, and also fabric, thread, zippers and buttons for making clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":743230,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30525},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30816},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":31111},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":31407},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":31707},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":32010},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":32315},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":32624},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":32935},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33249},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33567},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33887},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":34210},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":34537},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":34866},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34508},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":36125},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35873},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":36216},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36561},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36910},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37271}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.98},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":245.81,"local_amount":123859,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":125313.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430202,"comment":null},{"amount":320.69,"local_amount":161591,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":163487.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332976,"comment":null},{"amount":267.74,"local_amount":134913,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":136496.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301878997,"comment":null},{"amount":277.92,"local_amount":140036,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":141679.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147751,"comment":null},{"amount":362.84,"local_amount":182831,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":184977.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315380926,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-17T13:30:17Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435212,"name":"Celso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Celso tiene 36 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado con Herlinda, de 33 a\u00f1os, y fruto de ese amor tienen tres hijos.

This city has a lot of stunning flora and fauna.  The people here work in farming, livestock raising and textiles.  It is a very beautiful place where we are able to separate ourselves from everyday life and enjoy the landscape and amazing nature.  Leonardo lives together with his wife.  The couple have four children who are 7, 11, 13 and 15 years old.  Leonardo loves them very much indeed and works hard in order to provide for them and ensure they become upstanding citizens.  Whenever he has any free time, Leonardo goes out for walks with his family.  He also occasionally likes to eat one of his favorite meals: delicious fried fish.  Leonardo managed to complete a degree and become an elementary school teacher.  He really enjoys this career because he has a lot of patience for teaching.  \r\n\r\nLeonardo also works every day in his business making and selling paintings.  In addition to this, he provides an accommodation service to tourists who come to his city, and has a small, traditional, music orchestra.  Leonardo is, as we say in our country, a 'mil oficios' (Jack of all trades) because he does all kinds of jobs, as long as they are honest.  He is very active and charming and believes that he is doing well in his business as a result of this kindness and charisma, and because he puts a lot of effort into his work so that he can get ahead in life.  He needs to work in all his different business activities in order to provide for his household.\r\n\r\nLeonardo is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to buy beds, mattresses, sheets and mosquito nets.  He will also be able to make repairs to some of the rooms that he provides to tourists.  The tourist season is approaching and he would like to be able to provide a better service and greater comfort to the tourists who stay with him.  This will enable him to improve his income and his customers will recommend his business.  As a result, he will be able to continue working hard so that he can make his biggest dreams come true: to provide his children with a good education and to own a great

He lives in the Belisario Quevedo parish in Latacunga, a small city in Ecuador that during the last era experienced significant growth in its two most important industries: agriculture and floriculture. However, this has resulted in an important growth of all the city\u2019s industries and the majority of its population are indigenous and mestizo people who are beginning to find alternatives for economic and personal growth in this new context.  In addition, Latacunga has the peculiar distinction of being located dangerously near the Cotopaxi volcano, the largest active stratovolcano in the world.\r\n\r\nJuan Carlos emerges within this context, a difficult situation in itself, compounded by the fact that finding a source of credit has been practically impossible.  Juan Carlos only completed an elementary school education.  He already has a small business that he established more than six years ago.  Juan Carlos decided to carry on the family business and employ all of the skills taught to him by his uncles, who raised him to dedicate himself to the business of raw milk production and pig sales.   Although the beginning was a bit slow and difficult, now Juan Carlos is a bit better established and his business has achieved some stability.  However, Juan Carlos feels that he has reached a point where he would be able to grow and is looking to supply more people with his products and thus improve his income and acquire a better quality of life for him and his uncles who have always supported him.   For this reason, Juan Carlos needs your help.  He is looking for a loan to purchase another cow, which will help him raise milk production and increase his income, and allow him to improve his quality of life.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1112831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a cow.

It was a great idea because he does not have any competition in the area and it is going well for him.  He is open from eight in the morning until ten at night.  He also helps himself out financially by working as an informal taxi.  He does this in the afternoons by paying for a car and giving rides to people he knows.  Carlos says that he only gives rides to people who call him on the phone, which he tells us is safer for both him and the person he is driving.  His greatest problem, since he is the one who provides for his household, is that, at his age, he gets sick and has to stop working.  He will buy dried fruit to sell with this loan.

She resides in the district of Oyot\u00fan, an agricultural area located two hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of Lambayeque Department. Rosadina and her family are highly esteemed by their neighbors who have given them good personal references.\r\n\r\nRosadina has been selling tamales (a typical dish in some regions of South America, made of corn pasta stuffed with meat, vegetables and spices) for four years. This dish is widely consumed by the inhabitants of the area and is also greatly esteemed at the national level. Because of her pleasant demeanor and good customer service, Rosadina is very well regarded and sought after by customers wanting to buy her products. She uses her earnings to help her husband defray household expenses.\r\n\r\nRosadina wants to acquire supplies to expand her production and meet the demand that she currently has. Consequently she has decided to apply to Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of S\/. 1,000, which will help her meet her objectives.\r\n\r\nShe has already had a loan through Kiva and had very good results from that investment and is very grateful to the people who collaborated with her in that opportunity. Similarly, Rosadina thanks in advance those lenders who will collaborate with her on this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":927953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients and materials to expand her business selling tamales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oyot\u00fan - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-06-09T00:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-09T00:30:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosadina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":69},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":69.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":74.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":77.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":82.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":86.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":90.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":94.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":96.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":99.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.88,"local_amount":69,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":69.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423848,"comment":null},{"amount":25.96,"local_amount":69.25,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":69.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317274,"comment":null},{"amount":28.05,"local_amount":74.8,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-22T08:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":75.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374091,"comment":null},{"amount":28.3,"local_amount":75.45,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":76.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385329,"comment":null},{"amount":29,"local_amount":77.35,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-18T09:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":78.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368926,"comment":null},{"amount":30.9,"local_amount":82.4,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977963,"comment":null},{"amount":206.91,"local_amount":551.75,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":557.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115140,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T03:08:50Z","paid_date":"2013-02-01T10:10:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435246,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel is aged 26.

The town is located on the road that links two Kenyan towns. He is a married father of four children and runs a chair rental business which has been in operation for the last two years.

The charges are made per seat and this has proved a good source of income to Ibrahim and to others in the same business. \r\n\r\nIbrahim is applying for a loan of Ksh 21,100 to purchase a tent. This will enable him to provide services to people who would like to hold a function outside a room since they can sit under a tent.

Constituye el centro administrativo, econ\u00f3mico y cultural de la regi\u00f3n, siendo la ciudad m\u00e1s importante del Valle Central chileno. Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n","en":"Patricia Mar\u00eda belongs to the \u201cUnidos lo Lograremos\u201d communal bank, whose members live in the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nShe works as a seamstress, specifically she sews curtains and sportswear, and does general mending. She has been running her business for two years, and works from home. Patricia performs her sewing work from Monday to Saturday, and manages her work hours according to her availabilty.\r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago at distributors, as they are places where she finds her merchandise at low cost, so it is advantageous from a financial point of view. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy fabric for making sportswear, and thread, zippers and buttons for the mending her customers need.\r\n\r\nOne of Patricia's goals is to grow as an entrepeneur and to continue with her business in order to generate greater income, and this way go for a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nPatricia lives with her two children and her 13-year-old granddaughter who is in school. Her dream is to manage to have a workshop in her home, in order to serve her customers better, and at the same time add people to help her with her sewing. \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has offered her, as the loan will allow her to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nAs well, she is comfortable with the communal bank group that she belongs to, which motivates her to continue participating in the institution.\r\n\r\nShe also comments that the training provided at the meetings has helped her invest more effectively in her business. \r\n\r\nTalca is part of the Maule region, located in the central area of the country. It constitutes the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region, as it is the most important city in the Chilean central valley.\r\n\r\nTalca is the subject of a curious phrase in Chile: \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\" (\"Talca, Paris, and London\"). Among the possible explanations for this are some that say it derives from a comment made by an Englishman: \"Talca parece Londres\" (which, in Spanish, sounds like \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\", meaning \"Talca resembles London\"). Indeed, in the winter, an abundant fog often blankets the city, as happens in the capital of the United Kingdom."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1112762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy fabric for making sportswear, as well as thread, zippers and buttons for the mending work her customers need.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-06-09T02:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-09T02:00:10Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":702106,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":52625},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":53630},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":54653},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55696},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56759},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57843},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58441},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":60488},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":61217},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":62385},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":63576},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64793}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.61},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.39},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":320.85,"local_amount":160908,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":163569.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430201,"comment":null},{"amount":224.24,"local_amount":112455,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":114315.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332975,"comment":null},{"amount":352.48,"local_amount":176772,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":179696.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301878996,"comment":null},{"amount":246.46,"local_amount":123602,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":125646.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147750,"comment":null},{"amount":255.97,"local_amount":128369,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":130492.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315380925,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-16T21:25:43Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435270,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Irene tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado, tiene un hijo de 2 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la ciudad de San Pedro Sula, Cortes.\nDon Irene hace 10 meses  establecio su propio negocio. estubo viviendo por una temporada en el extranjero y con los ahorros que logro hacer, regreso e inicio su negocio. el vende productos como: cosmeticos, cremas para el cuerpo, productos dentales, gel para el cabello, ganchos,talcos shampoo, espejos etc.el vende en un peque\u00f1o local ubicado en el mercado del centro. el cuenta con su propia clientela y hasta el momento sus ventas han sido favorables, de alli ha podido solventar las necesidades de su familia.

One of the members of this group is Hortensia, who is 59 years old and is better known as Dona Tencha, and who has worked selling plants and flower pots for eight years. Dona Tencha says that what she likes best about her business is watering her plants and maintaining them well so that they can develop and above all fertilizing them so that they will not have pests.  She says that she started her business by buying rosebushes first, and then with her earnings she bought more plants including anthuriums, gardenias, bromeliads and others.  One of the things that is difficult in her business is fumigation, because it is a chemical product and fumigation must be done carefully so as not to damage the plant or breathe in the product which is unhealthy.  She says that the most beautiful experience that she has in her work is when she goes to buy new plants, because she gets to know new places and more varieties of plants.  She normally travels to the cities of Michoacan, Cuernavaca and Cuatla in other states within the country, but the plants that she likes best are those that she buys in Cuernavaca, Morelos, as they are the most cheerful and brilliant.  Dona Tencha is requesting a loan to buy plants and flower pots to sell.  The other members of the group are:  Denia - who sells food.  Julia - sells pharmaceutical medicines.  Ana Maria - sells food.  Paulina - sells food.  Paulina - sells shoes from a catalogue.  Delfina - sells shoes from a catalogue.  Francisca Graciela - sells shoes from a catalogue.

This loan will help her have better production and to harvest her crop and sell it in time so she can try to plant more next season.

This loan will help him to obtain more raw materials and be able to complete the orders placed with him on time, while the place where he exhibits his products belongs to his father-in-law, he treats it as if he were the owner."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1111163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy raw materials to make bricks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:07Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramon Emilse \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":427.33,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":47.48,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428737,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":47.48,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-20T08:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613458,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":47.48,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-17T08:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452929,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":47.48,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308448978,"comment":null},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":47.48,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":49.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443840,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":47.48,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048790,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":47.48,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005948,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":47.48,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568739,"comment":null},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":47.49,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":50.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118385,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-10T02:09:36Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:28:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435393,"name":"Chanthon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chanthon (in the photo), age 33, is a primary school teacher.

Hace aproximadamente 10 a\u00f1os, trabaj\u00f3 como cocinero en un restaurante del municipio, donde perfeccion\u00f3 sus conocimientos y sus habilidades que lo llevaron a considerar abrir su propio negocio e independizarse. Fue as\u00ed como cre\u00f3 el Restaurante \u201cDonde Edwin\u201d, utilizando inicialmente los utensilios de cocina de su madre ya que contaba con pocos recursos pero poco a poco fue comprando sus ollas, calderos y dem\u00e1s enseres para la producci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de ir adquiriendo una clientela que ha ido creciendo a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os. A algunos de sus clientes les ofrece cr\u00e9ditos quincenales para el pago de la comida, es por esto que necesita tener un capital de trabajo disponible que le permita comprar los insumos al por mayor para obtener descuentos y as\u00ed poder seguir atendiendo su demanda.  A pesar de que Edwin tiene competencia muy cerca, esto no representa amenaza para el ya que su \u00e9xito lo atribuye a su saz\u00f3n casera en los platos, donde utiliza principalmente muchas verduras frescas.  La especialidad de la casa es el pescado frito acompa\u00f1ado de arroz con coco, patacones, ensalada de aguacate y agua de panela, plato t\u00edpico de la regi\u00f3n costera donde se encuentra ubicado, muy cerca del mar.  Est\u00e1 aspirando a su segundo cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, siente que ha sido de gran utilidad para su negocio por ser una buena fuente de recursos.  Su mayor sue\u00f1o es trasladar alg\u00fan d\u00eda el restaurante a un local para independizarlo de la vivienda y as\u00ed brindarle mayor comodidad a su clientela y a su familia.","en":"From a tender age, Edwin learned the art of cooking having been brought up by his grandmother who had a restaurant for a long time, and who he always helped with it. Roughly 10 years ago, he worked as a chef at a restaurant in the municipality where he honed his knowledge and abilities which led him to consider opening his own business and to become independent.\r\n\r\nThat was how he came about setting up the restaurant \u201cDonde Edwin\u201d, initially he used his mother's cooking utensils as he had little resources but little by little he bought his pots, cookers and other equipment for production, moreover, he acquires a customer base which has been growing over the years. He gives some of his customers a layaway plan (payments every two weeks) to pay for the meals that is why he needs an available working capital which enables him to buy the suppliers in bulk to obtain discounts and in that way continue to meet the demand. Despite the fact that Edwin has competition nearby, this does not represent a threat for him as he attributes his success to the homely taste in his dishes, where he uses mainly a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables. The house specialty is fried fish accompanied by coconut rice, avocado salad and agua de panela [sugarcane water], typical dish in the coastal region in which it is located, very close to the sea. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking his second loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He feels that it has been extremely useful for his business as an excellent source of income. His great dream is to one day move the restaurant to premises to separate it from the home and make his customers and his family more comfortable.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1113758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy the supplies and food in bulk to produce the dishes that he sells.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-09T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-09T08:00:14Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91663}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":91667,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":92187.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338888,"comment":null},{"amount":23.94,"local_amount":42142,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":42381.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387223,"comment":null},{"amount":548.98,"local_amount":966191,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":971680.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071137,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-09T05:46:17Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435752,"name":"Walter Oswaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Walter, es un agricultor, tiene 20 a\u00f1os, vive con sus padres, est\u00e1 soltero, \u00e9l aprendi\u00f3 a los 15 a\u00f1os el trabajo agr\u00edcola junto con su padre desde hace cinco a\u00f1os est\u00e1 dedicado por completo, con el objetivo de obtener ingresos para apoyar a su familia y para cubrirse su propia necesidad.\n\u00c9l solicita un pr\u00e9stamo porque est\u00e1 iniciando la siembra de Chile para esto deber\u00e1 comprarse 1000 plantas, abonos, foliares, que son necesarios para aplicarlos al cultivo ayud\u00e1ndole mejorar y a fortalecer la plantaci\u00f3n.\nEl objetivo de Walter es aumentar su nivel econ\u00f3mico a trav\u00e9s de una buena cosecha, para tener una mejor condici\u00f3n y apoyar a sus padres en las necesidades b\u00e1sicas.\n","en":"Walter is a farmer, he is 20 years old, single and lives with his parents.

He has worked with repairing and selling computers and household appliances for seven years. Andrei chose this specific type of goods as he knows household appliances well and understands computer technology well. By profession he is a nuclear scientist, and he has worked at the nuclear power plant in Energodar. He went over to this type of work for health reasons and started to do business. He currently has goods worth around 210,000 hryvnia. \r\n\r\nAndrei plans to use the loan from Kiva, of the amount of 20,000 hryvnia, to purchase household appliances for selling in the future.
