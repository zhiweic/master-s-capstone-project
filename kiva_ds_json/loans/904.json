from Sierra Leone! This is 47-year-old Margrette from Moribatown southern area in Bo. She is widowed with 4 children between the ages of 10 years and 25 years. Three of her children attend school. She began her business because after her husband died, she need a permanent source of income to support the family. \r\n\r\nMargrette runs a food stand business where she sells gari (ground and roasted cassava root) and sugar. She has been running this business for 5 years. She works at the business every day, 7 days per week. Her other source of income comes from small-scale farming. Margrette describes her major problem as lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan in order to buy more local goods such cassava grain and bag sugar. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her standard of living. In the future, she plans to expand her business and try to see her children educated. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1142970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

My products are associated with the history of Guatemala; for example, our ancestors used to place tortillas in a square holder woven by women on a backstrap loom. Now, that same tortilla holder is used as a placemat or napkin. I have taught the art of weaving to more than 80 people, and now I dedicate most of my time to designing new colors with natural dyes, innovating weaving techniques, and supervising apprentices.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful to have this opportunity, as the loan will let me buy the materials I need to keep bringing my work to the weavers in my community.

She is a hard-working and very enterprising woman, in addition to being cheerful and sociable. She is separated from the father of her two children. She currently lives with just one of them, Cristian, age 23. The house where they live is rented.\r\n\r\nShe works providing tailoring services and making clothing. She has a small workshop which she set up in her home, where she installed her sewing machines. She learned this profession at a vocational education center, and she later started her business, buying a small machine and making garments for her friends and neighbors. She was able to make herself known and gain more customers, expanding her business and buying more machines to facilitate her work, thus improving her results. She has done this work for more than 16 years, with the help of a niece whom she pays by the week for her work. What she likes about her work is that it lets her use her talents in a profession she enjoys, since she likes coming up with new designs, and she also likes serving her customers. She has plans to expand the space dedicated to her business, and in the future to open a boutique in this same place. \r\n\r\nThis is loan number 5 for her with the MFP institution, and she feels grateful because in this way she will be able to move ahead with her business. She also feels comfortable with the members of her communal bank, since she considers them responsible people with a sense of solidarity. \r\n\r\nWith the amount she is requesting, 1500 Peruvian new soles, she will invest in buying supplies to make clothing, such as fabrics, thread, buttons and other items. She will also acquire a new sewing machine, valued at 600 new soles.

She is also happy and extroverted. She is separated from the father of her children. She now lives alone with them, Kensi is 25 years old and Tedsu is 18 years old. She has her own house, which she built on the land that she inherited from her father. \r\n\r\nShe makes a living preparing and selling food on the go like noodles, rice \"chaufa\", fried chicken, etc. She prepares everything during the day and then is posted in the front of her house. During the evenings her customers begin to arrive that are for the most part her neighbors and people passing by. She has been doing this work for more than 20 years and she currently counts on her sister for help in preparing food and attending to the customers. She gives her a daily pay. In this way she supports her with an income. She likes her work because she relies on the income to be able to cover the household expenses. In addition, she likes to cool, a skill that she learned thanks to her mother, who taught her when she way very young. The problem is the physical exhaustion that comes to her on long days since she remains open until very late in the night to sell everything she that prepared. She is conscious that it is her source of income and wishes to continue.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan she has with the MFP institution and she feels thankful for the financial support. She hopes to continue counting on more loans. Because of this she says that she will be punctual with the payment of her dues, as in the previous loans. In addiition, she likes the group that makes up her communal bank because she considers the members to be responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested of 1000 nuevos soles, she will invest in the purchase of wood to fix up her locale. She also needs tables and chairs. She will also replace her cooking utensils (plates, spoons, forks, glasses, and others).

Luis works in small-scale fishing. He learned the work from his in-laws when he married. He began as an assistant to the fishermen in the family business. With the passing of the years he acquired skill. At this time he does not have his own fiber boat, so he uses his in-laws' boat, in this way doing his daily work. The working schedule that he keeps is from the afternoons, when they go out on the open sea, until dawn, when they return with the product of their fishing to sell. For the most part, the products are shrimp, lobster, and fish, which he sells by the crate to the restaurants and by the pound to the retail trade. His greatest difficulty is the pirates who steal motors as well as fishing equipment and the product. Luis comments that one of his greatest worries is being stranded on the open sea. With the loan, he will buy nets and casting nets and make some improvements on the boat, since the salt has deteriorated it.

She lives in her own house with her husband and son.  The house is located in Totoral Bajo, a rural community located thirty minutes from the agricultural district of Tambogrande.  Her community is populated by humble people who want to improve.  At the moment it already has electricity.\r\n\r\nThe activity she carries out is raising sheep, pigs and barnyard fowl to sell.  She raises her animals in her back yard.  When they develop sufficiently she sells them to area merchants and sometimes in the district market.  She\u2019s been in this business for about 7 years.  In addition, together with her husband she owns a parcel of land where they have planted mangoes and corn.  With income they both earn from these activities they support their family.\r\n\r\nRosa Aurelia wants to buy nutritionally balanced feed and grains at wholesale to improve her animals\u2019 nutrition; she also wants to make improvements to her corrals.  With this investment her animals will develop better and will be sold at a better price.\r\n\r\nShe has already had a loan financed through Kiva and with that support was able to increase her income since the animals she bought developed properly and were sold at a better price.  Because of this she\u2019s quite grateful to the people who collaborated with her on that occasion and also avails herself of this opportunity to thank those who will support her now in advance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1138982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy animal feed and repair her corrals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-07-18T17:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-17T17:20:05Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":179.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":177.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":194.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":198.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":201.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":214.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":218.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":226.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":237.6},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":242.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":258.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.06,"local_amount":179.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":181.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317391,"comment":null},{"amount":68.19,"local_amount":177.3,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-22T08:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":179.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374214,"comment":null},{"amount":74.81,"local_amount":194.5,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":196.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385440,"comment":null},{"amount":76.4,"local_amount":198.65,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-21T09:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":201.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315369045,"comment":null},{"amount":77.41,"local_amount":201.25,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":203.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322978074,"comment":null},{"amount":82.48,"local_amount":214.45,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:11:12Z","rounded_local_amount":217.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115242,"comment":null},{"amount":83.94,"local_amount":218.25,"processed_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":220.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506923,"comment":null},{"amount":467.71,"local_amount":1216.05,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1230.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058859,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-30T14:14:12Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:30:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":450725,"name":"Mirasol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mirasol is 30 years old, and lives in the Philippines.

She owns her own home, which has electricity, running water and is on a paved road. Ten years ago, a park was built in her neighborhood and so a lot of people go there. This led to her opening a store and over the years and thanks to the government, which regenerated the area to attract tourists, the place is now known as El Varadero. Right now, her business is in the best location and she has a lot of customers. She works from Monday through Sunday from 8 of the morning until 7 at night. Her best days are on weekends with the increase in travelers. Letty works in her business alone and this allows her to help her children with their homework. Her husband is a fisherman and her children go to public schools. When she gets this loan she is going to buy pastries, groceries, soft drinks and thus improve her business with better sales and earnings.

He works about 10 hours daily and feels good doing his work as a watchman and he believes that he does well because he\u2019s esteemed for the good work he does and the kind way he treats others.\r\n\r\nDiego is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they\u2019ve given him he will be able to add a room to his house since currently Diego and his family live in a little house made out of matting and sticks and during the winter when temperatures drop they are cold and suffer a lot because of the rain.  In this way, Diego will be able to offer more safety and wellbeing to his family and in the not too distant future he\u2019ll be able to have his house built completely.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300.39,"image":{"id":1138981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He\u2019s been doing this since he was 16-years-old since he learned it from his parents.  \r\n\r\nAt first, he only worked as an assistant but when his wife abandoned him he decided to buy a machine and open his own business.  The decision was a good one because since then his profits improved and he\u2019s been able to provide security for his children.  \r\n\r\nHe set aside a room in his house where he installed his sewing machine and the cutting machine.  He also has some shelves to display the merchandise once it\u2019s finished.  He works every day and his two children help him in the morning because they attend school in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nHe will use the requested loan to buy leather and soles to make sandals.  Jorge has four children attending private school and his dream is to be able to help them with their university education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1139006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy leather and soles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Suburbio)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-18T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-17T19:20:04Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Libardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1053.21,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":78.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":80.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":84.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":86.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":88.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":94.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":96.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159.88,"local_amount":156.64,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":159.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340426,"comment":null},{"amount":82.29,"local_amount":80.62,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096796,"comment":null},{"amount":84.78,"local_amount":83.06,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":84.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331153,"comment":null},{"amount":86.1,"local_amount":84.36,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":86.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939796,"comment":null},{"amount":88.56,"local_amount":86.76,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":88.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072216,"comment":null},{"amount":90.08,"local_amount":88.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":90.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318574,"comment":null},{"amount":38.07,"local_amount":37.3,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":38.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453681,"comment":null},{"amount":149.02,"local_amount":146,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":149.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459529,"comment":null},{"amount":195.34,"local_amount":191.37,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":195.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087859,"comment":null},{"amount":100.88,"local_amount":98.84,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381632045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T08:00:42Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":450742,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is married and has 3 children.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese government. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives together with her family in the Bakiyan village in the north of Kyrgyzstan.  Just like many others in rural areas, to provide the primary source of income, Shaarbubu fattens up livestock, having started this business in 2002.

46 years old, married and raising a daughter.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry for 20 years, having started this business with a sum of 6,000 som (KGS), spent on a purchase of a cow.  Thanks for Suksur's hard work, today her business contains four dairy cows with offspring, and the monthly profit from sales of milk amounts to about 14,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Suksur requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued expansion of her

To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry for 12 years, having started this business with a sum of 3,000 som (KGS), spent on a purchase of a cow.  Thanks to Gamira's hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows with offspring and ten sheep, and the monthly profit from sales of milk amounts to about 15,000 som.  Unfortunately, her youngest daughter, Nurgul, is ill, and a large part of the business income goes toward her treatment.  In order to further develop her business, Gamira requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued expansion of her business and dreams of getting her daughter back on her

Agradece el apoyo financiero durante todo estos a\u00f1os, pues pudo administrar su dinero y volverlo productivo. Adem\u00e1s, le gusta mucho el trabajo con su banco comunal, por lo que promete ser puntual con el pago de sus cuotas.  \nNilda invertir\u00e1 este dinero en la compra de sacos de arroz y az\u00facar, como tambi\u00e9n en la compra de bebidas y dulces al por mayor. ","en":"Nilda is 35. She lives with 3 of her 4 children in the house she bought two years ago in Yanamarca. For some years, she has been farming and raising livestock; however, a year ago she started to sell basic commodities in her grocery store. Every morning she opens the doors to her store to serve local residents. After a few hours, she closes the store and heads to her fields. While she and her neighbors tend the land, she also sells soft drinks, water, and juices. \"It's my stable income, since I've found a way to continue to sell. After 8 a.m., the residents of my town head out to care for their plantings, so they are not at home, and I use this opportunity to continue selling,\" she says. She wants to increase her capital to offer a variety of foods.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the communal bank \u201cLa rosa de Guadalupe,\u201d and this is her sixth credit cycle with MFP. She is grateful for the financial support all these years because she was able to manage her money and make it productive. She also likes working with her communal bank and promises to make her payments on time.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 6000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth fervently hopes that her child will be able to graduate one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

A native of Riohaca, a city located in the department of Guajira, Belinda came to Barranquilla five years ago on the advice of her father to make a living in commerce and generate income to provide for her family. He gave her an iron, a hairdryer and a coffee maker, valued around $200 COP, so that she could find buyers and learn the market. With these items, she received orders and reinvested the capital. This first venture in business was very difficult, but little by little with a lot of hard work she was able to increase her sales and build a fixed clientele, which today carries a lot of weight on her loan portfolio. She hopes to sustain it in order to have the working capital needed to make purchases and keep her customers happy. It's for this reason she is requesting a loan, her first from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she plans to use to purchase sound equipment, irons and digital cameras, which are in demand, so she knows she will have success because her sales are assured. Her goal in the future is to improve the living conditions of her home, so as time passes her children will become more comfortable and secure in their own home. As this occurs she will continue working in her business to be able to achieve her dream of prosperity, with current indicators projecting a 19-percent gain on her investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1139789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase sound equipment, irons and digital cameras.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-19T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-18T04:30:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belinda Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77412},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84492},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86463},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88481},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90545},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92658},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94820},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97032},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99296},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101613},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103984},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":113204}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.12},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.53,"local_amount":77412,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":79729.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395538,"comment":null},{"amount":48.6,"local_amount":84492,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":87021.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775324,"comment":null},{"amount":49.74,"local_amount":86463,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":89051.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387326,"comment":null},{"amount":50.89,"local_amount":88481,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:51Z","rounded_local_amount":91129.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994151,"comment":null},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":90545,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":93255.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130510,"comment":null},{"amount":43.82,"local_amount":76174,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":78454.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071223,"comment":null},{"amount":64.02,"local_amount":111304,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":114635.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928038,"comment":null},{"amount":296.31,"local_amount":515129,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":530548.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083153,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-17T03:18:59Z","paid_date":"2013-11-27T09:49:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449521,"name":"Carminia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia  es la se\u00f1ora Carminia, ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cCusco Sur\u201d de la ciudad del Cusco - Per\u00fa, nuestra socia suge con su negocio de tienda de abarrotes.

She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCriselda hopes her business will expand and that her children will have a good and quality education through all her hard work on her business.

Rice farming is the main source of income for the family, and she and her husband have been involved in this for five years. Her husband supplements their income by catching fish for sale. Drought is the main challenge for her business.\r\n\r\nThis is the second microloan for Samey\u2019s group with Kiva\u2019s partner and they completely paid back the first loan. Samey successfully used the loan to buy a buffalo to help with her farming.

Out of her six children, she has three sons whose ages are over eighteen years, two of them are still in school, and the other helps support the family\u2019s business. To make a living, she and her husband have been farming rice on 1.5 hectares of farmland for almost thirty-five years, and her husband supplements the family\u2019s income by making palm juice. The current business earns her about 27,400 KHR per day. The main challenge for her is the small income earned to support her children\u2019s education until graduation. \r\n\r\nThis is the first microloan for Moeun\u2019s group of two with Kiva\u2019s partner VisionFund. Now leading her group to apply for a loan of 1,000,000 KHR each, Moeun, who is the leader, will use her portion to buy fertilizers for her farmland and use a portion of it to buy a piglet as additional income. She hopes this loan will enable her to earn more income so as to make a better living and keep her children until graduation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1143664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Kror Kor district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-19T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-18T12:20:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moeun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1539375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265661,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":513125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837568,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-20T09:33:23Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":449535,"name":"Yovana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yovana tiene 26 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy carism\u00e1tica y trabajadora.

He lives with his wife, 41, and his daughter in his old house which is located in the slum district in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. <p>\r\n\r\nSince his house was built, it has not been renovated.  Every winter his family faces one big problem, that is of heat loss trough the wall and floor since the house is so old and not updated.   It  is detrimental to his family,  harmful to their health and costly due to the fuel expenses.  Therefore he has decided to insulate his house wall.   Insulating the house needs foam, cement and other building materials. <p>\r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit a lot of pollution every night, from families just trying to stay warm.  In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on the natural gas.  The loan he is taking will be used to buy insulation materials to insulate his house walls to prevent heat loss.

She is 67 years old and a resident of Manila, Philippines. Her husband passed away, leaving her with three children, who are working already. She manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nFlorenia operates a junk shop.  Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines.  While waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Florenia's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will add the money to her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from trash scavengers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nFlorenia hopes her business grows more in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of their work.  There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Elba de 56 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer casada que vive en el municipio de Soledad con su c\u00f3nyuge y tiene 3 hijos en las edades de 27 a 34 a\u00f1os. All\u00ed practica una actividad comercial que le ha permitido generar ingresos que aumentan el bienestar de su hogar, porque vende calzado que trae desde Bucaramanga, una ciudad de Colombia reconocida por  la excelencia en su trabajo en cuero, materia prima del cual elaboran hermosos calzados, bolsos y art\u00edculos \u00fatiles para  damas caballeros e infantil, que generan una imagen de buen gusto y  distinci\u00f3n. Elba adem\u00e1s vende multiusos en tela, cuero, madera entre otros, productos que usualmente son comprados principalmente por las amas de casa de las familias, quienes son los principales clientes de ella.  Elba realiza sus ventas a cr\u00e9ditos pactados con sus clientes, de acuerdo a su capacidad de pago y esto es lo que hace que la inversi\u00f3n rote r\u00e1pidamente,  as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n que su creciente clientela aumente .

Mientras Elba trabaja por lograr sus metas, maneja una rentabilidad sobre las ventas no menor del 10%, una liquidez del 31,8 y una rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por cobrar de 45 d\u00edas, indicadores desde los cuales proyectamos el crecimiento de su negocio y auguramos \u00e9xitos en la inversi\u00f3n de su credikiva.   ","en":"Elba is 56 years old. She is married and lives in the town of Soledad with her husband. They have three children between the ages of 27 and 34. The income from her business has allowed her to improve her family's living conditions. She sells shoes that she transports from Bucaramanga, a city in Colombia known for its high-quality leather goods. The leather is used to make beautiful shoes, bags, and accessories for women, men, and children. They are distinguished in appearance and in excellent taste. Elba also sells a variety of goods in cloth, leather, wood, and other materials; these are mainly purchased by the housewives who make up the majority of her customers. Elba sells her merchandise on credit, drawing up agreements with her customers according to their ability to pay. Her willingness to give credit means that her stock rotates rapidly and her customer base continues to grow. She is currently requesting a loan from Kiva, financed through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy men's shoes, since she has a large order that she'd like to meet but lacks the working capital to fill it.

","en":"Deivis, 30, owns a furniture-making business.  He lives in the south of the city with his partner and their young children.  He hopes his children will study for professional careers.  Deivis learned the business from his father who, in turn, learned it from his and now he, Deivis, is heir to the family's 50-year tradition of making furniture.  He started in 2000, making and selling wooden furniture, kitchens, doors, etc.  Most of his customers are local people who have been referred to him by other businesses or people who were customers of his father before.  He is responsible for every aspect of the business, from buying materials to design and manufacture.   He collects 50% of the cost of an order when he receives the order and the other 50% when he delivers a final product.  He wants to improve his workshop so that it's both more productive and comfortable for him and his employees.  His immediate challenge is a lack of working capital.  He doesn't have enough cash to make a large fixed investment in the business and buy wholesale supplies of the materials he needs to operate.  He is applying for a Kiva loan that he will use partly to equip his shop and pay for routine maintenance and partly to buy bulk supplies of the materials he needs.  The investment will allow him to buy meet orders for the furniture that he has jointly designed with his buyers, orders that pay more than he can usually expect to make from regular orders.

He has a shoemaking workshop in the living room of his house with a sewing machine and a table for cutting leather.  He started his business as a game, learning how to make shoes.  However, over time he realized that he would like to start working privately.  He does not work alone but has two assistants who each have different duties.  He invests $2.30 into making his shoes and sells each pair for $5.50, making a profit of $3.20 which allows him to cover his costs and expenses.  The biggest competition he has is the Chinese market because, owing to their high production volume, their products are cheaper.  He adds that customers see the cost but not the quality.

Marcos has lived his whole live here and his business is transporting goods.  He is 38 years old, single, and doesn't have any children though he hopes to change this status in the future and find a nice woman who is interested in a hard-working man like himself.  Some years ago, Marcos used to own a fishing boat but some of his friends were robbed and they lost their boat and produce.  This kind of episode is what most worries those who work in this business.  Thanks to God, there was not a sad ending and Marcos was able to return home.  At that point he decided to buy a truck which he could use to transport the fishermen to the docks, towing their boats so that they can go fishing.  His work starts at 7 o'clock in the morning and he works until 6 o'clock in the evening, from Monday to Saturday.  Marcos will use his loan to buy four new tires for his truck as his current ones are worn and he doesn't want to have any accidents.  Over time, he hopes to improve the service that he provides by replacing his truck or making some repairs to it."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1140024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy tires","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Playas (Villamil)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-19T18:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-18T18:40:11Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcos Arturo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750.96,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":57.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":59.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":61.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":62.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":66.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":68.99},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.58,"local_amount":163.35,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":168.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340430,"comment":null},{"amount":54.53,"local_amount":52.84,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":54.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096800,"comment":null},{"amount":56.18,"local_amount":54.44,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":56.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331157,"comment":null},{"amount":57.06,"local_amount":55.29,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":57.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939800,"comment":null},{"amount":118.38,"local_amount":114.71,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":118.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072220,"comment":null},{"amount":61.06,"local_amount":59.17,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":61.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013322,"comment":null},{"amount":63.16,"local_amount":61.2,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":63.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453685,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":62,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":63.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459532,"comment":null},{"amount":65.22,"local_amount":63.2,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":65.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087863,"comment":null},{"amount":66.85,"local_amount":64.76,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":66.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381632049,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T20:59:04Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":451037,"name":"Shehe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shehe started operating his kiosk business five years ago.
