Her plans include making her shop bigger, adding sewing machines, and hiring an employee that will support its growth. Currently her work capital is not enough to have this goal succeed and for this reason she turned to a Kiva loan. Also, this is the first financing she has done with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this she will buy a sewing machine and an overlock sewing machine.

These were delivered to her with special discounts and she then distributed them to different populations in the department of Magdalena. Currently she travels three times a week and specialized her offer by selling products made from plastic on credit for which she's paid weekly. Her goal is to be able to help her son so that he can have his own home. For this reason she works day after day. Her biggest challenge is having enough work capital to respond to the demand and this is just what she's looking for with a Kiva loan: to succeed in obtaining a greater buying capacity in accordance with the orders that her customers have made and to always keep their business. With her Kiva loan she will buy plastic chairs, water storage containers, punch bowls, buckets, and cauldrons, among other items. Her investment is predicted to be successful because she would add new work capital to her business with which she will buy items that go quickly.

She loves them a lot and she does everything she can to see them happy and ensure they don't suffer hardships.  Yomara and her children live in the city of Camana.  This city is noted for its hot climate, its beautiful beaches, its fishing and its cuisine including 'chupe de camarones' (shrimp chowder).  Like all good Peruvians, Yomara loves traditional food and one of her favorite dishes is 'tallarines verdes' (green noodles).  In her free time she enjoys spending time with her little ones which they all enjoy.\r\n\r\nYomara managed to set up her room rental business with a lot of hard work and savings.  She serves eight clients a month, most of them being people who come from other cities for work.  Yomara decided to start this business as her mother is abroad.  She believes that her business is doing well because she is very respectful and understanding with her clients.  Above all, the rooms that she rents out are always clean.\r\n\r\nYomara is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to plaster her walls.  This will allow her to provide her clients with a better environment and greater comfort.

In the mornings she tends to the household chores and also watches over her small store. She has had the store for a year and a half; it is a source of income which allows her to contribute to her family's expenses. With the joint effort of her and her husband, they have been able to move forward and provide an education to their children who are currently both studying. They were also able to buy land in which they hope to build a house on in the future. With this loan she plans to invest in improvements to the property where her store is located.

is a 52-year-old single man who has been working as a butcher for 22 years. He has wide experience in his field and his customers are very loyal to him since he was the first in his region to open a big butchery. Most of his customers prefer to deal with him because he raises his own cattle and sells the meat. In this way, Joseph gives confidence to his customers that the meat they are eating is coming from well-raised cattle.\r\n\r\nJoseph is working on expanding his business. That's why he applied for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy and raise a head of cattle to trade for additional income. This is his second time as an Al Majmoua borrower. He describes his first experience as impressive and he was a borrower in good standing.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to expand his businesses as much as he can to please his customers in many different ways.

Tiene la duda de c\u00f3mo hacer para seguir invirtiendo en este negocio en el futuro puesto que no cuenta con los recursos necesarios para invertir en los insumos y en el alquiler de la tierra para seguir operando.

Wendy is a charismatic, hard-working and, above all, entrepreneurial young woman. She works in agriculture, growing mainly dry grains such as corn and beans, which are in high demand in her area. This is one of her main sources of income as her partner's wage does not cover the continually increasing expenses of running their home. Wendy has been doing this type of work for a long time, and she has achieved good results from it. Many people come to buy their corn or beans from Wendy because she sells them at a good, affordable price. She is concerned about how to continue investing in her business in the future as she does not have the necessary resources to invest in raw materials and the rent payable on the land she uses for planting. This led her to the decision to apply to INTEGRAL for this loan to invest in buying: manure, corn and rice seeds, poisons for dealing with plagues and to rent a larger portion of land for cultivation. This is so that she can continue to earn the same level of income from her work, which has worked well by allowing her to provide her family with their daily bread. She hopes to improve her income level which will allow her access to better living conditions for herself and for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1027590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy: manure, corn and rice seeds, and poisons for dealing with plagues, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-03-16T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-15T10:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wendy Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347003826,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-16T12:56:15Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:29:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":401584,"name":"Ignacio De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nIgnacio de Jes\u00fas habita en casa propia junto con sus hijos los cuales le ayudan a trabajar para llevar el pan de cada d\u00eda  a su hogar. \u00c9l se dedica al cultivo de granos b\u00e1sicos como: ma\u00edz y frijoles que son los  que m\u00e1s se producen en la zona donde habita.
