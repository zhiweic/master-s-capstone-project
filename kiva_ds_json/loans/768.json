The association engages in a variety of activities, such as selling clean cookstoves, teaching women to read and write and educating women about family planning.  \n\nIn July, nine women from the association starting selling solar lamps (seven of them are featured in the photo).  As of the end of September they sold 1,200 lamps and they have ambitious plans to grow the sales. \n\nKorotoumou (fourth from the left) is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains.  In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light.  With a solar lamp, her customers can save money.  Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years.  These solar lamps provide 8 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\n\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\n\nSelling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association. The women earn $2 for every lamp they sell and the association earns $3.  The money the association earns is invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\n\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory. They educate their communities about the benefits of solar lights and generate lamp sales through group meetings and demonstrations at night.\n\nSince customers cannot afford to pay for the lamps up front, the women need working capital. A Kiva loan will allow the solar saleswomen to obtain solar lamp inventory from NOTS Lampe Solaire on credit.

This group consists of eight members and is led by a Board of Directors in which Sra. Susana is the president.  The members of this Communal Bank engage in various businesses such as weaving blankets, working as a cleaning assistant, selling soft drinks, selling chicken giblets, selling plastic goods, and providing chauffeur services.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Sra. Susana.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer one loan cycle ago after receiving an invitation from a friend who is also a member of the organization.  Susana currently has a butcher shop.  She is knowledgeable about this line of work because she learned the trade from her previous job where she was a butcher\u2019s assistant.  Later on, she decided to establish a space for her own business.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying meat in bulk.  She acquires her inventory from the wholesale distributors in the city of El Alto and then sells her goods to the public upon request.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income to support her family.  Susana is single and has four children.  \r\n \r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Susana said that she enjoys the support of her credit advisor.  \r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1466588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy meat in bulk.

This area is defined by its inhabitants who make a living raising and selling small animals and cattle for milk and meat. Jos\u00e9 is 48 years old and currently married. At the moment, he has one dependent child. They have been living in their own house for 49 years.\r\n\r\nIt has been very fulfilling for him to help his children get ahead with the little that they have at this time. His wife is and has been a strong pillar in his life and home because of his need to leave to work. In addition it was she who started raising and selling small animals.\r\n\r\nDue to his parent\u2019s labor, he was able to finish primary school. However, because of his family\u2019s difficult economic situation he had to start working when he was very young. Thus he was able to be a great source of support for himself and his family.\r\n\r\nHe learned this business because it is very common in the area, since it is a rural sector. He works from 6 to 8 hours a day caring for his animals. It has been a little difficult to transport his cattle to the different markets because he does not have his own transportation.

Working with One Acre Fund has improved Manasse's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \n\nIn the future, Manasse hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, buy a goat, and invest in a business.  \n\nManasse's Group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. \n\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\n\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manasse ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tabitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kundu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":411873,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411873}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642531,"name":"Viviana Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Viviana es una mujer de 39 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Pucallpa con sus cuatro hijos, ella es madre soltera, trabajadora, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por sacar adelante a su familia; lamentablemente por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos y por la necesidad de trabajar, Viviana no pudo estudiar una carrera profesional.\nPor iniciativa propia, Viviana trabaja como vendedora en una empresa comercial de su ciudad, ella trabaja todos los d\u00edas por un aproximado de 10 horas y cree que le va bien por su dedicaci\u00f3n y buen desempe\u00f1o.\nViviana se encuentra muy agradecida con los prestamistas Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada realizara el mejoramiento de su vivienda, ya que desea reforzar el techado y ponerle piso de concreto a su hogar, de esta manera ella y su familia tendr\u00e1n mayor seguridad y bienestar, as\u00ed pues Viviana seguir\u00e1 trabajando y esforz\u00e1ndose para lograr su gran sue\u00f1o de tener una vivienda adecuada y segura para sus hijos.

Each of these group leader farmers represent a group of several farmers in their area.

Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 52 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\n\nWycliffe is 60 years old and has been a farmer for 30 years.  Wycliffe works as a farmer to provide for his 12 children.  The community and other farmers know Wycliffe as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in community activities such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Wycliffe described his harvest last year as excellent, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWycliffe joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Wycliffe joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, purchase fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  Because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund.  Wycliffe has become more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Wycliffe's life because he has earned profits from harvest, has received more farm training, has more farm group support, been able to save money and feed the family.  In the future, Wycliffe hopes that his profits from 2014 harvests can be used to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business. \n\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

He is 46 years old, married and has three children. His background is agricultural engineering.\n\nMaxime distributes solar lamps in five regions in Mali, including Kayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso, Segou and Mopti. He sells the majority of his solar lamps to poor rural populations such as miners, rice and grain farmers, women who produce cashews, shea butter and pepper, and students. Maxime partners with local cooperatives, teachers, and a network of nuns who live in rural communities to help organize events and raise awareness about the benefits of solar lamps. He also sells through two community associations: Eau Vive Mali and GASE Yeelen, where he serves as president.\n\nMaxime\u2019s customers currently rely on kerosene lamps and flashlights for light. Those that have mobile phones have to walk long distances and pay to charge their phone. They spend about $110 per year on kerosene and mobile phone charging. \n\nHowever, a solar lamp that provides 8 hours of high quality light a night and can charge a mobile phone costs just $25 and has a lifetime of about five years. There are no recurring costs as sunlight powers the lamp for free! \n\nPaying $25 up front for a solar lamp is difficult for Maxime\u2019s customers, though. It is challenging to save that amount of money or to obtain a small, affordable loan.  Most of Maxime's customers earn about $2 a day, which barely covers basic needs like food. Banks only lend to people with a bank account and formal employment contracts, and microfinance institutions only make loans for business activities.\n\nA Kiva loan will allow Maxime to purchase 2,000 solar lamps from NOTS Lampe Solaire on credit and then offer credit to his customers. Ultimately, this loan will enable Maxime to improve the livelihoods of about 10,000 people and reduce the negative impact of kerosene on the environment. Families save money on light and mobile phone charging, feel safer at night, are healthier (no toxic smoke from kerosene) and can increase their income because they are able to work at night. Children are also able to study longer. A win-win-win for everyone.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1506291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for solar lamps that he will sell on credit in rural communities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":49900,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maxime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":23950000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":49900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":23950000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643491,"name":"Tamara Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo lo conforman cuatro mujeres emprendedoras y luchadoras una de ellas es Josefa tiene la edad de 32 a\u00f1os, casada, con un hijo de 9 a\u00f1os de edad, su negocio es la venta de ropa usada y de cosm\u00e9ticos de Avon, tiene de ser cliente de la instituci\u00f3n 4 a\u00f1os.

Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, close both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts, and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.
