She is married to Gabriel, who works in civilian construction and is the father of her children. They are currently living with their daughter and their two grandsons. They own the house they live in. Zoila's business consists in selling soft drinks and sweets of various flavours and brands. She has a refrigerator in order to keep her wares cool, since the weather is very hot where she lives. Providers deliver to her home, and she buys the merchandise from them at wholesale prices before retailing it. She has been in this business for 36 years and is very well-known in the area. For now, her husband helps from time to time with manning the counter. Zoila considers her business to be profitable, since it generates a good income that enables her to pay for household expenses as well as help with her grandsons' education. Quite the opposite to their situation before starting her business, since the husband's income alone was not enought to pay for all the household's expenses.

She started working independently, with the help of her uncle, over two years ago. Additionally, she has also performed manicures and pedicures in the afternoon, for over 10 years. She likes her businesses because they provide her with a job and they generate an income so that she can support her partner with the household expenses and the education of her child.

She produces dairy food -- cheese, curds and yogurt -- and sells it in Tbilisi (capital of Georgia). Total average monthly income of the family is 900 Lari.\r\n\r\nNani requested a loan to purchase hay to feed the cows during the fall and winter seasons. Hay is cheap now, but the price increases by 30% to 40% in the fall months. Nani can significantly save on the costs of feeding the cows. Since the cows will be fed properly in winter, they will give a planned amount of milk to the family. The income of the family will increase accordingly. Thus, Nani will be able to increase her agricultural business and improve living conditions of the family.

name is Mercy and I am 25 years old. I recently relocated to Lusaka from my hometown of Kitwe, in the Copper belt province of Zambia. I am asking for a Kiva loan so that I can start my own mobile money transfers business.\r\n\r\nI am the last born in a family of six.  Before I underwent my training to start running my own shop, I worked for a telecommunications store as a cashier. This taught me how to be responsible with money because I handled a lot of cash.  I believe that I will be able to bring the skills I learnt from my previous job to my own business.\r\n\r\nGetting the Kiva loan means that I will be able to set up my mobile money transfers shop. I will use the loan to buy the phones that I can use for transactions, some chairs so that my customers can have a place to sit. I will also use the money to brand my shop so that I can attract customers.\r\n\r\nI am very excited about starting my own business because I see it as a way to improve my economic status and that of my family. \r\n\r\nThank you Kiva lenders for having the heart to help other people by lending us money.

She has eight children, five of whom still need her support, as they cannot earn much money. Two of her dependent children are working for others for pay and some of the other children are still at school. Yum has been farming for 30 years on two and half hectares of farmland as her main source of income. She also plants watermelons, raises chickens, and works for others for a fee to earn additional income to support this big household. Her main challenge is the drought in the first quarter of this year that made her crop yield fruitless. To overcome this challenge, she formed a group of seven members who applied for a new loan. This is the fifth loan for Yum, the second loan for three of the members, the third loan for two of the members and the first loan for the last member. With success, Yum has managed to pay back all the past four loans and it has improved her living conditions so they are better than before. Now, she is applying for 1,300,000 KHR. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland and pay for harvesting fee. In addition, she is going to use some portion of the loan to buy 20 more chickens to raise. She hopes to earn more income from her current businesses so she can save some money to buy a new motorbike for her family to use."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1147292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer, pay the harvesting fee and buy more chickens to raise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Sampov Meas district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-23T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-22T00:10:04Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yum ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phuong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ton","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soeurn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":6000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2350000},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":577.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":897.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":208.96,"local_amount":850000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":853176.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118633,"comment":null},{"amount":49.17,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":200747.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265692,"comment":null},{"amount":98.33,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":401495,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339640944,"comment":null},{"amount":430.21,"local_amount":1750000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1756540.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355940944,"comment":null},{"amount":565.42,"local_amount":2300000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2308596.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046375,"comment":null},{"amount":122.91,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":501868.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837601,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-24T14:53:57Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":450676,"name":"Paula","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Paula es una madre de familia de 23 a\u00f1os de edad que reside junto a su esposo y a sus dos hijos de 5 y 2 a\u00f1os de edad en una de las comunidades rurales que conforman el distrito agr\u00edcola de M\u00f3rrope, su comunidad es una zona bastante peque\u00f1a y humide de ambiente emprendedor en cuanto a sus actividades laborales y cooperacion con sus vecinos. \n\nSe dedica a la crianza y venta de animales, en la parte posterior de su vivienda tiene corrales en los cuales cria animales menores como pavos, patos, pollos, etc. Y frente de su domicilio en un predio de propiedad de sus padres cria y comercia ganado porcino, caprino y ovino.

Unfortunately, he believes that the loan requested is not sufficient to complete this goal in the short term.

He learned this trade from his father, who was the one who taught him from the time he was very young. As time passed, he met the woman who is now his wife. He married and they went to live in Basti\u00f3n with her family. Their house at the beginning was of thatch, but with effort, little by little, he constructed it of cement. In his shop he offers all types of services, but what his customers ask for most is body work, a service that he offers with the help of a neighbor whose work complements his. He also sells spare parts in general. Oscar's greatest problem is crime. Since his shop is small. when he has a lot of work he has to leave the cars outside, which thieves take advantage of to steal parts. The loan that he is applying for is to purchase a hydraulic crane, which he needs to lower the motors of the cars. He hopes to improve his services considerably with this machine and thus begin constructing the second floor of his house, so that the lower part can be used entirely for his

tiene 55 a\u00f1os, es un hombre bueno, amable y muy trabajador.

Junto a ellas vive en la casa de su hermana, en compa\u00f1\u00eda tambi\u00e9n de sus sobrinos.\n\nSu trabajo es la fabricaci\u00f3n de muebles para el hogar y la construcci\u00f3n de casas. Trabaja en un taller de carpinter\u00eda de un amigo, al que acude todos los d\u00edas, desde muy temprano, para empezar con su faena. Mientras que el trabajo de construcci\u00f3n de viviendas lo realiza solo de manera eventual, cuando sus familiares, vecinos o cualquier cliente ocasional solicite su mano de obra; para ello trabaja con dos personas cuando necesita ayuda. Lleva en esta actividad (la carpinter\u00eda) 20 a\u00f1os y la seguridad econ\u00f3mica que este trabajo le ha brindado ha hecho que su familia pueda contar con los servicios b\u00e1sicos en su hogar. Le gusta mucho plasmar su creatividad en los muebles y accesorios que crea con sumo cuidado, teniendo siempre en cuenta que la calidad de los mismos es el principal requisito que demandan sus clientes; sin embargo, este trabajo le exige ocupar gran parte de su tiempo durante el d\u00eda, lo que le impide disfrutar de su familia como realmente lo desear\u00eda. A pesar de esta dificultad, nunca ha pensado en dar marcha atr\u00e1s y lo que ahora quiere es tener su propia carpinter\u00eda, ya que ha venido postergando este sue\u00f1o y ahora espera concretarlo.\n\nEste es su cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 5 con MFP y est\u00e1 muy contento de saber que tiene un apoyo financiero, pues as\u00ed se siente m\u00e1s seguro de progresar con su trabajo.

Del mismo modo, se siente aliviado de pertenecer a su banco comunal, ya que todos sus integrantes son muy responsables y solidarios.\n\nCon el monto solicitado, de 1000 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 algunas herramientas que necesita para iniciar su taller de carpinter\u00eda como cepillo de madera, galopa, serrucho y martillo.","en":"Justiniano is 55 years old. He is a good, friendly, and very hardworking person. He is not married, but he has two daughters who are 15 and 14 years old. He lives together with them in his sister\u2019s house, where his nieces and nephews also live. \r\n\r\nHis work is making furniture for the home and building houses. He works in the carpentry shop of a friend, where he goes to work every day. He begins his workday very early in the morning. He builds houses on his own, from time to time, when a family member, neighbors, or any occasional client requests services. He works with two additional people when he needs help. He has been doing this work (carpentry) for 20 years and the economic stability that this job has provided has allowed his family to have basic utilities in their house. He likes to express his creativity in the furniture and accessories he makes with the utmost care. He always has in mind that fact that quality is the highest demand of his customers. However, this work requires most of his time during the day, which prevents him from enjoying time with his family as much as he would like. Despite this difficulty, he has never regretted it, and now what he wants is to have his own carpentry workshop. He has been putting off this dream for a long time and now he is hoping to make it into reality.\r\n\r\nThis is his 5th loan with Microfinanzas Prisma and he is very happy to know that he has financial support because this makes him feel more confident in making progress with his work. He pledges, once again, to make his repayments, as he did with the previous loans he\u2019s had. He also feels glad to belong to a communal bank because all of the members are very responsible and mutually supportive. \r\n\r\nWith the requested amount, PEN 1,000.00 (nuevos soles) he will buy some tools that he needs to start this carpentry workshop, such as planes, hand saws, and hammers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1143615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy some tools to start his own carpentry workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-23T06:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-22T06:00:08Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justiniano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":151.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":159.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":158.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":171.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":174.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":184.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.5,"local_amount":151.24,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":159.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402112,"comment":null},{"amount":63.83,"local_amount":159.59,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":168.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456427,"comment":null},{"amount":63.6,"local_amount":158.99,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":167.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452088,"comment":null},{"amount":68.58,"local_amount":171.46,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":180.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447261,"comment":null},{"amount":69.78,"local_amount":174.45,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":183.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053162,"comment":null},{"amount":73.71,"local_amount":184.27,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":194.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188096,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Weekends are the busiest times, and many customers can't get service after early morning. \r\n\r\nJes\u00fas, with his nose for  business and taking advantage of the potential to serve the customers who came every day, added a new business offering telephone and internet service that has flourished, increased his earnings, and with which he hopes to achieve his dream to prosper and to keep growing his business. He is applying for his first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domino, with which he will buy a new washing machine to gradually meet the market demand for this service.

The monthly income of the family is 240 Laris. It is hardly enough to feed a three-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category; they get the above-mentioned monthly social assistance from the government, as they are estimated to live below the poverty line.\r\n\r\nNunu requested a loan from Credo to start up a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Nunu will purchase a milk cow. She will place it in an old empty farm building located in their yard. Nunu will work hard in the farm. She will produce cheese and sell it in the village. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly increase the income of the family.

With this loan she will purchase snacks such as cookies, french fries, and sweets in general.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to continue with her business and expand part of her home for the store so that she can generate higher revenues.  This way she can have a higher quality of life.  Nidia lives with her parents, a brother, a niece, and her eight year old son.  She wishes to purchase her own home and give her son the best.  \r\n\r\nShe very much appreciates and is happy for the opportunity brought to her by Fondo Esperanza (Hope Fund) that will permit her to invest in her business.  Now that she has learned to better organize her business and manage her capital she realized the training provided has been fundamental for her business and her personal development.  In addition, she feels very comfortable with the other entrepreneurs of the communal bank because of the respect, unity, and confidence that exists among the members.  \r\n\r\nPe\u00f1alol\u00e9n is located east of the metropolitan region.

All the members live in Colina, a community in Santiago.\r\n\r\n\u00c9rica is the member of the communal bank who is seated in the first row in the fourth seat from right to left of the photo, wearing blue jeans and a red shirt with black and grey lettering, holding a folder and purse in her hands, and  whose hair is black and cut short. For 6 months, she has been selling at her shop. She says she works alone; her shop is located in her house, and she works Monday to Friday depending on her availability. She must purchase her merchandise from discount distributors so that her business is economically viable. She will use the loan to buy thread, needles, school supplies, and packing materials.\r\n\r\nHer business goals are to build a space on her patio and obtain a city permit so that her merchandise can be displayed well and her customers are satisfied shopping there. \u00c9rica lives with her two daughters and a nephew. She dreams of having a stable business that will meet her financial needs and provide for her family's well-being. She is happy and grateful for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza that will allow her to invest in her business. She says the training has been critical to her business and personal development, as she had learned to better organize, invest, and spend her income. \r\n\r\nColina is located in the north of a metroplitan area (Santiago, the capital of Chile is located here). Today it is an important business center, primarily in agribusiness as large companies have set up offices here and brought many employees to the community. Country homes are common in the area, which has increased the number of residents considerably. There are also tourist attractions such as hot springs, water sports at Laguna Piedra Roja, and mountain climbing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":1144191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy thread, needles, school supplies, and packing materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Colina","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-07-23T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-22T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaudy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":2139279,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125275},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":132472},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":139045},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":137810},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":139127},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140448},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":141793},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":143147},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":144516},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145890},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":144216},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":151135},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150103},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":151535},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":152767}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.98},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":292.74},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.93},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1093.3,"local_amount":534602,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":535172.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294333026,"comment":null},{"amount":1154.48,"local_amount":564515,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":565117.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301879047,"comment":null},{"amount":1197.92,"local_amount":585757,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":586382.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147801,"comment":null},{"amount":929.3,"local_amount":454405,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":454890.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315380958,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-24T21:05:31Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":452437,"name":"Irma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irma is 44 years old.

is 49 years old. She lives in the village of Mukhiani, West Georgia with her husband Elguja and her 31-year-old daughter. The family earns a living through a small-scale agricultural business. They grow melons and greens on a family owned plot of land. Margarita and Elguja sell the harvested products on local open market. Margalita requested loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of their low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe monthly income of the family doesn\u2019t exceed 200 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMargalita requested loan from Credo to construct a greenhouse. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nTamila requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provisions for business startups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tamila will purchase a small truck. She will start trading in seasonal fruits and vegetables. Alexander will help her. They will purchase fruits and vegetables from local farmers at wholesale prices and sell them in nearby towns with a price markup.

is 26 years old. She is married and lives in a small village of Kareli District with her family: her husband \u2013 Sergo, their 1-year-old daughter, her parents-in-law, her  brother-in-law, and the grandmother of her husband, who is a pensioner.  Her husband and brother-in-law serve in the army and get a monthly salary. Natia and her parents-in-law run the family agricultural business with two milk cows, three calves and two pigs.  They produce cheese and sell it on the local open market. The family owns a plot of land as well, where maize, haricot beans, apples, cherries and pears are grown. They work hard on their plot during the spring and summer seasons to get a good harvest.  They sell harvested product on the local open market. \r\n\r\nNatia requested a loan for purchasing calves.

Her small store is in a well located area. \r\n\r\nFatuma has gained a great deal of sales experience and she is proud of her results. She has a large number of customers because they know that everything she sells is top quality at reasonable prices, and she provides excellent service. Fatuma is very dedicated to her work. She always tries to do better and doesn't consider giving up on her way to success. \r\n\r\nOne of her biggest dreams is to grow her business so that she can increase her earnings. She would like to invest in additional inventory but she does not have capital to do this. She is therefore requesting a loan from Yehu microfinance that will enable her to buy more stock of spare parts and gallons of petrol. Fatuma is responsible and very capable of making payments. She is sure she can repay the debt and at the same time provide her family with a better quality of

In her free time, Placida likes to watch the news and educational programs on TV.  On a few occasions, she prepares the delicious \u201clocro\u201d (Peruvian squash stew) to share with her family.\r\n<p>\r\nThrough her own initiative, Placida works with great effort and dedication each day at her small business of selling cheese.  She also earns some income by selling beer.  Placida works at her business approximately 10 hours each day.  She enjoys her job and believes she is doing well since her customers recommend her because of her good prices and friendly service.    \r\n<p>\r\nPlacida is extremely grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the assistance they will provide, she will be able to make improvements to her home.  She wants to add finishing touches such as plaster, paint, floor tiles, and windows to her home.  This will provide her family with greater security and well-being.  These improvements will also result in a more comfortable and pleasant environment in which her children can develop.  In the not-so-distant future, Placida wants to completely finish the construction of her home so that she can start a small grocery business in order to secure an education and a future for her children.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1139803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to pay for home improvements.

She currently has a small business in tire sales; she tell us that it's been about five years since she learned to run this business together with her spouse as a family business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she will receive will improve her business through buying a tires, which she will buy from a distribution center and then sell at her own sales points in her stores. This line of work generates income to support her family as much as possible, as she is married and has four children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she replies that she likes the health center."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1144331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy tires.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-07-23T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-22T21:00:04Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eleuteria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susnaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24242.4,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4040.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4040.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4040.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4040.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4040.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4040.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":583.34,"local_amount":4040.44,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495294,"comment":null},{"amount":583.34,"local_amount":4040.44,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260839,"comment":null},{"amount":583.34,"local_amount":4040.44,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490549,"comment":null},{"amount":1166.68,"local_amount":8080.88,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:20:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8120.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095408,"comment":null},{"amount":583.3,"local_amount":4040.2,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4059.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235485,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T18:21:51Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:43:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":451870,"name":"Ivan","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u0432 \u0433. \u041c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c. \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d -

When she started, six years ago, it was difficult for her to be successful, since she didn't know very much about how to attract customers.  However, in time she learned sales techniques and was thus able to make progress and become a successful vendor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, five years ago she had radio equipment installed in her house so that she can provide a service whereby people can communicate with their relatives or friends who are in remote areas.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is that she can have time to do all the things that she wishes, and the fact that she is able to provide her daughter with enough attention.  Things are going well, since the income has allowed her to plan for the future.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she will be able to obtain support in order to grow her business.

tiene 20 a\u00f1os, es una mujer buena, amable y muy trabajadora.

Vive en casa de sus padres donde todos los d\u00edas comparte con ellos la alegr\u00eda de estar juntos y trabajar para poder brindarles una mejor calidad de vida.\n\nSu trabajo es la venta de comida. Todos los d\u00edas sale a la vereda de su casa, por las tardes, para ofrecer deliciosos platillos t\u00edpicos de la regi\u00f3n, a los que acompa\u00f1a con refrescantes bebidas preparadas con frutas naturales.

Lleva realizando este trabajo por 3 a\u00f1os y empez\u00f3 siendo ayudante de su madre quien ahora le dio el control total del negocio, es por eso que trabaja mucho, ya que adem\u00e1s de trabajar tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 estudiando y tiene que darse tiempo para dedicarse a sus labores acad\u00e9micas. Anteriormente vend\u00eda jugos y panes durante las ma\u00f1anas, pero tuvo que cambiar de actividad debido a la importancia que representa para ella forjarse una carrera. Le gusta mucho lo que hace, ya que aparte de tener un tiempo disponible para otras funciones, tambi\u00e9n le genera muy buenas ganancias. Antes de poder realizar este trabajo ten\u00eda problemas con el pago de sus mensualidades en el instituto en donde estudia, pero ahora est\u00e1 m\u00e1s tranquila, ya que tiene un respaldo econ\u00f3mico.

She is single and doesn't have any children, since she would like to get an education before taking the plunge into motherhood. She lives in her parents' home, and shares with them the joy of being together and working to offer them a beter quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe works selling food. Every afternoon she goes out to the sidewalk in front of her home, and offers delicious regional dishes, which she serves with refreshing drinks made with natural fruit. She always treats her customers well, and offers them well-seasoned food, made with the highest quality ingredients. She has been in this business for three years. She started out as a helper for her mother, who has since put her fully in charge of the business. She works hard because, besides working, she also goes to school and has to allow herself time for schoolwork. She used to sell juices and bread in the mornings, but she had to make changes to the business because it is important to her to pursue a career. She enjoys her work very much, because besides having time available for other things, it also generates a very good profit. Before being able to work in this business, she had trouble making her monthly payments at the school she attends, but now she has more peace of mind, because she has financial backing. She would very much like to be able to expand her business, set up more tables and chairs, and stock up on some utensils she does not yet have. \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP and she is very happy knowing they offer her financial support, because this gives her confidence in moving forward with her business. On her part, she is committed, once again, to making her payments in a timely fashion, as she did with previous loans. And she is very happy to belong to her communal bank, because all of its members are very kind and supportive. \r\n\r\nThe entire amount requested, 800 nuevos soles, will be invested in purchasing ingredients and supplies for her food, such as rice, chicken, oil, olives, and fruit, as well as two tables, eight chairs, a dozen plates, and other utensils she needs in order to offer a better service.

In the afternoons she returns to her house and awaits the arrival of customers so she can attend to them with cordiality and they leave having bought some perfume, cream or other item of their preference. Her grandchildren help her in the sale of soft drinks when she is not in the house. At night is when there are the greatest number of sales because her daughter in law works selling food. This is the perfect opportunity for customers to satisfy their appetite and have refreshing drinks. \r\n\r\nShe likes her work a lot because it allows her to be active throughout the whole day. She feels very useful and energetic to continue working for the good of her family. Now she has many plans to improve the display of her products.
