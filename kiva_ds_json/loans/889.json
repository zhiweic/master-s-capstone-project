He is a cobbler, he does electrical work, and he sells cell-phone minutes at the same time.\r\n\r\nInitially, 20 years ago, Reynaldo worked in a business as a messenger, and 15 years ago he worked in electricity.  Finally he went out on his own and set up his own business venture in these two services.  To make the most of his customer contacts he added communication services, managing four cell-phone plans to generate additional income.  He is very well known in his business area because he offers home service, which helps to strengthen his market.  His clientele has grown gradually and he needs to have inventory of raw materials and supplies to be able to respond quickly when a customer needs a shoe repaired, because they need him to respond opportunely.\r\n\r\nFor this reason he is requesting a Kiva loan to buy soles, lace, glue, and synthetic materials to change the style of shoes that are brought to him to be updated.\r\n\r\nThis is what will make his Kiva loan effective, and he can better promote himself.\r\n

He lives in a rural zone in northern Peru.  This is his second loan with Kiva\u2019s support and the first one was a total success because it helped him consolidate his fruit and vegetable business.\r\n\r\nHis community\u2019s quality of life is at the subsistence level.  Most are independent workers in commerce and raise animals.  Some also work in agriculture.  Within his family environment there are humble conditions but quite a strong will for his work activities and neighborly cooperation.  His main commercial activity is selling vegetables.  He has ten years\u2019 experience in this line of work.  He buys corn and lentils from nearby fields to then sell in the cities of Chiclayo and Lambayeque.

 de 45 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a la confecci\u00f3n de ropa y tambi\u00e9n elabora con sus propias manos artesan\u00edas, como individuales, llaveros,  accesorios pintados con diversa t\u00e9cnicas y resinados. Ella dese muy joven se capacit\u00f3 en confecciones, cuando estudiaba en un colegio administrado por  monjas y all\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 este arte, que le ha servido para potencializar su talento y desarrollar su propia fuente de ingreso y empleo. Cuando inici\u00f3 lo hizo con varias mujeres de su barrio, organiz\u00e1ndose en una cooperativa  y cada una aport\u00f3 su propia m\u00e1quina, las cuales ubicaron en un local, e iniciaron la producci\u00f3n de prendas de vestir;  aunque este proyecto dur\u00f3 muy poco, le dio las bases para tomar de \u00e9l su experiencia e independizarse;  en un principio se sinti\u00f3 desanimada, pero no tard\u00f3 en tomar sus propias riendas y confeccionarle a vecinos, familiares, amigos, que gradualmente le fueron refiriendo a otras personas con necesidades de su servicio, hasta que estructur\u00f3 su hoy clientela fija. Como Zoraida tiene un gran potencial creativo que muestra en sus dise\u00f1os, ha logrado agregar valor a su trabajo, pues ha realizado cursos de artesan\u00edas que le han facilitado trabajar acabados con excelencia y tambi\u00e9n como fue patrocinada por una multinacional en su formaci\u00f3n en las artes y t\u00e9cnicas para ser aplicadas a manualidades, ella se organiz\u00f3 con otras mujeres para producir,  aprovechando los empleados de la empresa patrocinadora, los cuales han convertido en su  clientela actual, que han ido conquistando poco a poco con las bellas artesan\u00edas y manualidades a las cuales les aplican las t\u00e9cnicas aprendidas y producen sus propios ingresos.  En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante la cual comprar\u00e1 hilos, adornos, telas, pinturas, madera, e iraca; su cr\u00e9dito es potencialmente exitoso porque est\u00e1 fundamentado en pedidos que le han hecho los empleados de la multinacional que la patrocin\u00f3, que tienen gran estabilidad laboral,  a quienes les responder\u00e1 con un surtido de sabanas elaboradas por sus propias manos y con ello crecer\u00e1 cada vez mas.    ","en":"Zoraida, 45, works making clothing and handicrafts by hand such as place mats, key chains, and accessories painted with different techniques and resinated products.  She became accomplished in sewing from a very young age, when she studied in a school run by nuns and learned this art, which has served her to make the most of her talent and develop her own source of income and work.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning she did it with several women in her neighborhood.  They organized themselves as a cooperative and each one brought her own machine, which they got a place for and started producing clothing.  Although this project didn't last very long, it gave her a foundation for her experience and she went out on her own.  At first she felt discouraged, but she didn't waste any time taking control of things and making clothes for neighbors, relatives, and friends, who gradually started referring her to other people who needed her services, until she formed her current steady clientele. \r\n\r\nZoraida has managed to add value to her work because her great creative potential shows in her designs.  She has taken arts and crafts courses that have enabled her to do excellent finishing touches.  Also, she was sponsored by a multinational company in her art and technical courses to be applied to handicrafts.  She organized herself with other women to produce, making the most of the sponsoring company's employees, who have become her current customers.  They have won them over little by little with the beautiful handicrafts to which they apply the techniques learned, and they produce their own income.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it she will buy thread, decorations, fabric, paint, wood, and \"iraca\" straw.  Her loan is potentially successful because it is based on requests from the employees of the multinational company that sponsored her.  They have stable work, and she will respond to them with a supply of her handmade sheets, with which she will keep growing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1128945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy thread, decorations, fabric, paint, wood, and \"iraca\" straw.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-29T04:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-29T04:10:09Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54072},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58834},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":60207},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61612},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":63049},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64520},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":66026},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":71680}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.44,"local_amount":54072,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":58559.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395496,"comment":null},{"amount":35.3,"local_amount":58834,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63717.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775284,"comment":null},{"amount":36.13,"local_amount":60207,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":65204.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387285,"comment":null},{"amount":36.97,"local_amount":61612,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":66725.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994115,"comment":null},{"amount":37.82,"local_amount":63049,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":68282.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130476,"comment":null},{"amount":38.72,"local_amount":64520,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":69875.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519349,"comment":null},{"amount":82.62,"local_amount":137706,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":149135.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071190,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Since 1992 she has been working continuously for this company and she is one of the skilful masters. Her husband works as a plumber.  She lives with her husband and her two children in her common apartment which was built in the communist era in Mongolia. It has two rooms and has never been completely repaired or renovated. Also, much heat is lost through the windows and walls in winter time which is very harmful to their health and money. In winter, Altantsetseg usually uses the furnace that uses smoky coal and other kinds of fuel just to stay warm. Therefore, she has decided to repair her apartment by insulating the walls and windows. The wall insulation will be made from cement, rock wool and other insulation materials. At her calculation, it will cost about 4,000,000 MNT for all the costs.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries. This is due to the long cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40 degrees Celsius (-40 degrees Fahrenheit) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families who are simply trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian air pollution. \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems and also so they can buy cars that run on natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and the health of Mongolians. The loan that Altantsetseg is taking out will be used to buy the building and insulation materials to repair her apartment.

He is 63 years old and lives with his 16-year-old son and two grandchildren of 11 and eight years. Anzor\u2019s grandchildren go to school. Anzor has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to fund the start-up of his agricultural business without any success. His loan requests were rejected each time due to his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family's only source of income of the family is Anzor's monthly salary. He is an agricultural worker in the village. The family's monthly income doesn\u2019t exceed 200 GEL, or approximately 120 USD. It is hardly enough to feed a four-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \r\n\r\nAnzor is requesting this loan through Credo to start a pig farm. His loan request was approved in the frames of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Anzor will purchase piglets and feed.

She is a very entrepreneurial woman who likes progress. She needs the loan to buy raw materials to make belts and boots, and to buy bulk grains to stock her grocery store. She wants to make her business selling leather belts and boots profitable, and her grocery store as well, in order to offer products for household consumption for the people of her town.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community and she earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nMerlinda is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan to buy more quantities of fruit to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Merlinda faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners that gather weekly to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1128423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to

She earns a minimum of Php500 (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php26,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nTomasa hopes to expand her business soon.

Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Nazira was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of 20,000 som (KGS).  She buys merchandise valued at an average sum of 30,000 som (KGS) at a market in the capital twice per month.  Today, her merchandise selection is limited and this is why Nazira requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further development of her

As his business grows, his working capital becomes insufficient to meet daily demand and this has become one of his challenges which is the reason why he\u2019s calling on his Kiva loan, his first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that he\u2019ll use to buy a large amount of cold cuts to respond to pending orders in his market and surrounding areas and that in the future with new working capital will allow him to gradually access markets in other towns which is the goal he\u2019s focused on for later on.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1130537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a larger amount of cold cuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Galapa-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-29T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-29T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elver ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66950},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74735},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":76479},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":78263},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80089},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81958},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83870},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":85827},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87830},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89879},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91977},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":102143}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.5,"local_amount":66950,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":69485.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395490,"comment":null},{"amount":42.97,"local_amount":74735,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":77565.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775279,"comment":null},{"amount":48.93,"local_amount":85098,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":88321.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519343,"comment":null},{"amount":444.6,"local_amount":773217,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":802502.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928008,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T16:46:50Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":444112,"name":"Weichafe Ruka Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Banco Comunal se llama \u201cWeichafe Ruka\u201d (casa de guerrero), est\u00e1 conformado por 17 emprendedores quienes se dedican a diferentes rubros, entre los cuales se encuentran; venta de le\u00f1a, reposter\u00eda, venta de perfumes, venta de pan amasado, venta de carb\u00f3n, venta de ropa, servicios entre otros.

Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Bukaticha was able to develop her business to contain three cows and four bulls, and have a monthly income of about 20,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Bukaticha requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional heads of livestock.

Part of their produce is used by the family and the rest is sold locally. The family owns a plot of land as well, where they grow potato, wheat, haricot beans and barley. Stepan and Knarik work hard during the spring and summer seasons to produce a good harvest. The total average monthly income of the family is 700 Georgian lari.\r\n\r\nStepan has requested a loan for purchasing calves. He will raise the calves and sell them after several months for a profit. As a result of the above-mentioned activities, the income of the family will increase. With the increased profit, Stepan will be able to reinvest in the family business to expand it and make it more profitable, improving the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1128647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Orali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-06-29T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-29T17:10:05Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stepan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":136.59,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":223.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440541,"comment":null},{"amount":136.59,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":223.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045594,"comment":null},{"amount":136.58,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":223.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331181593,"comment":null},{"amount":136.59,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:58:07Z","rounded_local_amount":223.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565471,"comment":null},{"amount":136.59,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":223.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115055,"comment":null},{"amount":136.59,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":223.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860553,"comment":null},{"amount":136.58,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":223.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569384,"comment":null},{"amount":136.59,"local_amount":223,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":223.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968041,"comment":null},{"amount":132.3,"local_amount":216,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":216.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748500,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-29T17:04:38Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:47:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":444750,"name":"Maria Natividad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, casada, tiene 6 hijos, vive en una aldea del Municipio de Intibuc\u00e1, La Esperanza.\nMaria tiene una actividad que le genera los ingresos necesarios para los gastos del hogar.

","en":"Begaiym is a participant of the \"Astra\" group.  She is 51 years old and has three children.  In search of a source of income for her family, Begaiym started her own business in animal husbandry and farming in 1993 with an initial sum of 2,000 som (KGS).

business, Jamboree Party Rentals, provides inflatables and games for parties, special events, festivals and carnivals.

Since then, Jamboree has grown to include ten bouncers, carnival games, and other party favorites. \r\n\r\nAs the owner and administrator, Helena handles the day-to-day paperwork and scheduling while her husband, James, handles the delivery and customer service aspects of the business. Helena has three children ages 23, 15 and 10 and says that her family and even her extended family are involved in the business.\r\n\r\nWith the continuing success of Jamboree Party Rentals, she hopes to expand the rental business to an indoor facility. Currently Jamboree Party Rentals is a seasonal business and weather is a big factor in its success and an indoor facility will allow Helena to host parties throughout the year. She hopes Jamboree becomes a party destination for the entire Detroit metro area.
