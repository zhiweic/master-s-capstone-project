He is pictured here with a group of 8 One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 89 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Moses has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nMoses is married and has 9 children. He is 49 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Moses has been a farmer for 16 years. Moses described his harvest as poor last year, but believes he can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nMoses first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Moses joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund. Moses plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Moses\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from the harvests, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nMoses and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelight","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mildred","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":476061,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":476061}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645200,"name":"Asiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asiya is a 46-year-old married woman, living with her six children and spouse in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.\r\nHer husband is a driver by profession and provides transportation services by using a three wheeled auto rickshaw.

Other than farming, she is also involved in her community groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Elizabeth described her harvest last year as excellent, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\t\r\nElizabeth first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Elizabeth joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and as an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Elizabeth\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from the harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nElizabeth and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T19:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T19:30:05Z","loan_amount":4075,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matayo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geofrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":353034,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353034}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645214,"name":"Martha's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group consists of 9 group-leader farmers in Webuye District, with Martha selected as the Kiva representative.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.<br \/>Moses is 55 years old and has been a farmer for 36 years.  Moses works as a farmer to provide for his 8 children.  The community and other farmers know Moses as friendly,  hardworking,  reliable,  trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community though groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee.<br \/><br \/>Moses described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.<br \/><br \/>Moses joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Moses joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods,  get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed family.  Because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Moses has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Moses's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed his family.  In the future, Moses hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, buy a goat and invest in a business.<br \/><br \/>Moses and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.

One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo.\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Athanas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caleb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilfrida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacinta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":326289,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326289}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656148,"name":"Gabriella","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u044d\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u2014 \u0438\u0437 \u0412\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434-\u0445\u044d\u043d\u0434. \u0420\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430, \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u0422\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0443\u0436\u0435 6 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0441 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0438 \u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e. \u0413\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u044d\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u2014 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u044d\u043b\u043b\u044b \u2014 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b. \n\u0413\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u044d\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0432 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435, \u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u043a\u0443\u0445\u043d\u0435. \u0421\u0443\u043c\u043c\u044b \u0432 24 000 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0435\u0439 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0432\u043e\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c.

Michael has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving seed for one quarter acre of maize and seed for one quarter acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of KES 5,349 for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMichael is married and has two children.  He is 39 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Michael has been a farmer for 15 years.  Michael described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMichael first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Michael joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds,  earn enough to feed family and  send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  As an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Michael plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Michael\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMichael and his group need a loan to cover for the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T22:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T22:10:18Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janerose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":476061,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":476061}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645278,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is a farmer, and she lives in Nanyuki area in Kenya.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFrancis is married, and has 16 children.  He is 53 years old, and is known as friendly and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and burial committee.  Francis has been a farmer for 32 years.  Francis described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFrancis first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season.  Francis joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\n Francis plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Francis\u2019s own life was improved because he had more profits from his harvest, and was able to save money.\t\r\n\r\nFrancis and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low, and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo, and is standing at the left of the photo.\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T22:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T22:50:14Z","loan_amount":4325,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jentrix ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":374430,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374430}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646079,"name":"Matilde","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Matilde, es madre soltera de dos hijos, tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, para sacar adelante a su familia se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de petates, es una actividad que realiza de desde 20 a\u00f1os, es un oficio que aprendi\u00f3 de familia, trabaja todos los d\u00edas, y vende su producto en la zona donde reside.\nInvertir\u00e1 en la compra de tule, ya que es su materia prima, espera tener una buena producci\u00f3n, aumentar sus ventas, cumplir con los pedidos de sus clientes, atraer m\u00e1s clientes y mejorar sus ingresos con los que tiene pensado seguir apoyando con los gastos familiares y cancelar las cuotas de una manera puntual.\nAspira con hacer crecer su negocio para tener los recursos para mejorar su vivienda y darles un estilo de vida a su familia.\n","en":"Matilde is the single mother of two children.

In the region where she comes from, many people live in rural areas where they don't have access to electricity.  This is a common situation in Tanzania, where the national grid reaches only 14% of the population: that means 38 million people are without electricity.  Jane knows that solar power can be an affordable and efficient solution to get access to energy.  \n\nThe impact that solar power can have is huge and varied: with solar products the people of Mbeya will be able to light their homes at night; to charge their mobile phones for free in their own home; to keep businesses running after sunset; and their children will be able to study in the evening without having to use harmful kerosene lamps.  As of today all of this is impossible, as people have to walk, sometimes for hours, just to charge their phone, and pay for it as well.  After sunset there is no light if not that provided by kerosene, which is dangerous for people's health, especially children, and for the environment. \n\nJane's objective is to use a Kiva loan to start her own business and provide solar power products to the people in her community.  Part of the loan will go towards the purchase of products.  The rest will be used to cover the costs of running the business, such as transportation and marketing.  Eventually, Jane wants to set up a solar shop in her hometown.  \n\nAs a university graduate who has already gained retail experience in the renewable energy sector, Jane understands very well how to run a business, to keep track of her revenues and expenses, and to reach out to customers.  She has been working with African Solar Rise for over 3 months now, and has demonstrated her reliability and motivation.  She has already brought power to many families, teaching them how to use the products and installing them herself on the roofs of the houses.  Jane has received training within the Solar Village project of African Solar Rise, and she therefore has the technical knowledge of solar power products needed to install them and to provide after-sales services to a high standard.  With all of these assets, she is confident she can run her activity successfully, and maintain a high level of sales.\n\nA Kiva loan will give Jane the opportunity to start a new stage in her life, and to have a truly significant impact on her community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1507888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy solar products and establish her own solar business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":309,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":8000,"lender_count":245,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":8000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-14T16:42:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656835,"name":"Rosa Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Rosa forma parte del grupo de cr\u00e9dito El Cisne desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, en todo este tiempo ha llegado a tener una muy buena amistad con todas las socias, vive por la parroquia del Valle en Cuenca, lugar que goza de una belleza natural y de verdes campos, su arquitectura es una mezcla de lo antiguo y lo moderno.

The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGerald is 50 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years. Gerald works as a farmer to provide for his six children. The community and other farmers know Gerald as friendly and hardworking. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community, such as in the men's group and the savings group.  Gerald described his harvest last year as good, but he hopes that he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGerald first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Gerald joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and earn enough to feed his family  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member and wants to help more farmers. Gerald plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Gerald\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest and was able to save money. \r\n\r\nGerald and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase better harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":3575,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gerald","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":310242,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":310242}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656856,"name":"Martha Genoveva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Genoveva tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a sus hijos en el distrito de Nueva Arica, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda, es una comunidad que se caracteriza por tener suelos f\u00e9rtiles, tambi\u00e9n se puede encontrar grandes dep\u00f3sitos de ripio, arena y piedra, ubicado en la Provincia de Chiclayo, que pertenece a la Regi\u00f3n del mismo nombre, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nElla tiene una bodega donde vende abarrotes, como leche, aceite, arroz, az\u00facar, gaseosa y art\u00edculos de aseo, dedic\u00e1ndose a esta labor desde hace m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 1 500 nuevos soles para la compra de mercaderia para abastecer su negocio y atender las diversas necesidades de sus clientes y de esta manera generar mayores ingresos para su familia.\n\n","en":"Genoveva, 39, lives with her children in the Nueva Arica district.

Margaret has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMargaret is married and has two children.  She is 45 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable and trustworthy.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and savings group.  Margaret has been a farmer for 22 years.  Margaret described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMargaret first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Margaret joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and send children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers.  Margaret plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school and save for the future.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Margaret\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training, able to save money and feed the family. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMargaret and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T02:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T02:30:11Z","loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":299544,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645322,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John was born in Kisii, Kenya, and moved to Nairobi, the capitol city, in 2007 in search of a job.

Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 96 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJanepher is married and has five children. She is 39 years old and is known as hardworking. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, and she is also a community health worker. Janepher has been a farmer for 10 years.  Janepher described her harvest as poor last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre fund.

Janepher joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and new farming methods.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and  spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Janepher plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Janepher\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, and was able to save money.  \t\t\t\r\n\r\nJanepher and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to have access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T02:50:03Z","loan_amount":5925,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janepher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elphas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":513504,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":513504}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656883,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma operates a retail business selling homemade products in her village to make a living.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDickson is 59 years old and has been a farmer for 30 years. Dickson works as a farmer to provide for his 10 children.  The community and other farmers know Dickson as hardworking, reliable and an experienced farmer.  In addition to farming, he is involved in his community's men's group and the burial committee.  Dickson described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nDickson joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Dickson joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices and send his children to school.  Because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Dickson has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Dickson's life because he has more profits from harvest and has more farm training. He was able to save money and feed the family.  In the future, Dickson hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and invest in a business.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Dickson and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

They have seven children. The four oldest daughters are married. The rest are in school. Jamila has a very big family; the kids are growing up hardworking, intelligent and obedient. Jamila is proud of her children; her husband and children all help with the housework.\r\n\r\nJamila has a high school education. Her main income for the family comes from managing livestock and agriculture. She started 12 years ago by buying cattle for 10,000 KGS. With hard work Jamila now has three dairy cows, three calves, 12 sheep, 13 goats and a small plot of land to grow corn and clover for their livestock.

He is pictured here in a group of eight One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 97 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Lucas has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. <br \/><br \/>Lucas is married and has eight children. He is 50 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking and experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group and prayer group. Lucas has been a farmer for 29 years. He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.   <br \/><br \/>Lucas first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Lucas joined One Acre Fund in order to earn enough to feed family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers. Lucas plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and repair the home. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Lucas\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and was able to feed the family.<br \/>   <br \/>Lucas and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Electine\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest and was able to save money. Electine\u2019s life has also improved because she was able to pay school fees.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nElectine and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.

Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":25,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T08:10:02Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Electine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lusaka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":379779,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656942,"name":"Elmar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elmar is 32 years old and married with two children.

He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.

As the Kiva group representative, Jesca is pictured on the right of the group with her hand raised.\t\r\n\r\nJesca is married and has 5 children. She is 40 years old and is known as friendly and an experienced farmer. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and prayer group. Jesca has been a farmer for 12 years. Jesca described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2013 long rains season won\u2019t be Jesca\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. She first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. As an active member in her community, Jesca also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative. Jesca plans on using future profits from the harvest to buy a cow and invest in a business. Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has been able to save money and feed the family. Jesca also joined One Acre Fund because of early planting.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJesca and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T09:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T09:50:03Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gideon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milcah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":379779,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T20:01:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645365,"name":"Ekua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Due to difficult circumstances, Ekua did not have access to a formal education, yet this has not stopped her from achieving her dream of becoming an entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nCurrently she sells \u2018banku\u2019 (a traditional Ghanaian dish made from fermented corn dough and cassava dough) served with okro stew.

Each farmer will receive an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings.\r\n\r\nWilson, 50, has been a farmer for 22 years. He is married and has five children. He is known as hardworking and as an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in such organizations as the savings group and prayer group.

He joined One Acre Fund to learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed the family.

Working with One Acre Fund has improved his life because he has more farm training and is able to feed his family. He hopes his profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Wilson and the Bidii group will use their Kiva loan to cover the initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

Her husband is a cultivator and during off seasons he takes up all possible work to make an earning. \r\n\r\nReinai is the profile member for Ava Group. She is pictured with her hand raised. Ava's literal meaning is yellow colour. The group called themselves Ava because yellow colour is the primary colour in their traditional attire. The group is formed by 15 hardworking women who live in the same village, which is about 30 kms from Imphal town in Manipur, which is one of the northeastern states in India.\r\n\r\nReinai runs a cosmetic shop on the main national highway connecting the state and the neighbouring state. The shop is located close to the village where Reinai lives. She opens the shop early in the morning and closes down in the afternoon. She sells talcum powder, sunscreen lotion, shampoo, night creams, small sachet shampoo and other cosmetic products. The shop is close to a college where young girls come for classes and usually purchase cosmetics from the shop. Most of her customers are college girls and young lasses from neighbouring villages. She usually gets the supplies from the capital market and sells them at a little higher price for profit. The generated income is insufficient to support the family because she needs to pay the tax for renting the shop and also purchase supplies for the shop.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will purchase more cosmetic products like good quality foundation cream and other winter creams and moisturisers. She usually purchases cosmetic products with the seasonal change. Reinai says that she will repay the loan on time and will try to manage savings by opening a savings account once she purchases stocks for the shop and sells them out successfully.\r\n\r\nShe says, \u201cThank-you so much, Kiva.\u201d She will always remain grateful for the wonderful help that Kiva has shown towards her and the group.\r\nThe rest of the members are engaged in weaving, piggery, poultry and other businesses\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1510705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more stocks of cosmetics for the shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T15:30:39Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T15:30:39Z","loan_amount":3675,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chasii","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ashi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rune","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seirou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irish","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lounirou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reinai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seiru","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":225000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":225000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657002,"name":"Weedor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Weedor is 43 years old and lives in Gardnersville.

He is pictured here in a group of seven One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 66 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  \r\n\r\nNahshon has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\r\n\r\nNahshon is 60 years old and has been a farmer for 35 years.  Nahshon works as a farmer to provide for his seven children.  The community and other farmers know Nahshon as trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group and prayer group.  Nahshon described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\r\n\r\nNahshon joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and he is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Nahshon joined One Acre Fund so that he could get new farming methods.  Nahshon wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers because he is an active community member.  Nahshon has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Nahshon's life because he was able to save money.  In the future, Nahshon hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to save for the future.\r\n  \r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Nahshon and the Jamii Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":4075,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nahshon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jotham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alphonce","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arnold","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":353034,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353034}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645407,"name":"Ngoc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngoc is 42 years old, is married, and has two sons.

However, thanks to hard work during recent times, he was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So Edgar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

Josephine is standing on the right with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to Josephine and the 69 other individual One Acre Fund farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here, but they will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings (KES) for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nJosphine is a reliable member of the community. She is married with six children. Josphine is 47 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 26 years to support her family. In addition to this, Josphine is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group and burial committees. She described her harvest last year as good. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund to enjoy the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\r\nJosphine joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and is now enrolling in the 2014 Long Rains season as a group leader. Josphine joined One Acre Fund so that she could learn new farming methods. Because she is an active community member, Josphine has become more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.\r\n\r\nWorking with One Acre Fund has improved Josphine's life because she has more farm training, and has been able to save money to feed her family. In the future, Josphine hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. \r\n\r\nJosphine and the Imani Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues to provide training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer and hybrid seeds of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathews","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elimina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clermentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":369081,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645421,"name":"Aitha Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Aitha group consists of four females from Hodeidah, Yemen.
