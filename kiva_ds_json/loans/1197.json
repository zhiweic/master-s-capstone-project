She was also chosen by Al Majmoua to attend the \"1st Euromed Forum of Women Micro-entrepreneurship\" which took place in Strasbourg in November 2008 to link women from Arabic Mediterranean countries, build a network and test the European market responsiveness to handicraft products from the Arab countries.\r\n\r\nThe forum helped Hanaa to increase her self confidence as she met people from different cultures, and exchanged experiences and new skills with other micro-entrepreneurs. Hanaa also received a great testimony of appreciation of her mosaic work from customers: they were impressed with the high quality of professionalism in her work. \r\n\r\nHanaa took two loans from Al Majmoua to purchase a ceramic stone-cutting machine and some other work materials. This machine allowed Hana to save 50% on the cost of raw materials and 30% on her time. She previously had to rent one for USD 100 per day.\r\n\r\nShe has also benefited from many training opportunities from Al Majmoua and was able to become a vocational trainer for her peers in the community. She trains other women to acquire new skills and start a new business. \r\n\r\nHanaa is very satisfied with what she has learned and accomplished. She feels more confident as she proves herself by participating more and more in the budget and decision-making of her family. \r\n\r\nUnlike her previous loans, Hanna is acquiring a third loan cycle from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua to pay for her daughter's increasing university tuition fees."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":415,"image":{"id":1413684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for her daughter's university fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Nabatieh","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hanaa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728845,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997780,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419762395,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429412466,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439630448,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-25T21:04:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597387,"name":"Jalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jalia is married with four children, two of whom go to school.

He sells regional products, and has farmland where he raises different crops such as coconuts, oranges, lemons, and different tropical fruits that he harvests every two days and then sells in the main city market.\r\n\r\nIn times of low production, he harvests once a week and does other things to ensure financial solvency.  He has been doing this for more than two years and things are going well for him.  His wife helps with sales and serving customers.  In the evenings he works as a security guard for a day care center, which generates additional income.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy because both activities are providing him with good results.  Previously his greatest problem was transporting his products to town because of the bad road conditions.  The lack of available labor in his area also did not allow him to harvest as expected.  However all everything has improved and now he works with better results.\r\n\r\nThis will be his sixth Kiva loan and he is grateful for the financing he receives so he can move forward and promises to make his payments on time.  He is asking for a loan of 800 Soles to buy various regional products such as yucca, plantain, and bush meat, since he has high demand and doesn't have these things on his land."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":192.99,"image":{"id":1417160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gunter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":127.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":126.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":136.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":139.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":146.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.41,"local_amount":123.75,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":130.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865295,"comment":null},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":127.29,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":134.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353671,"comment":null},{"amount":47.56,"local_amount":126.82,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":133.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905433,"comment":null},{"amount":51.29,"local_amount":136.77,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":144.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091421,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-27T13:40:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599720,"name":"Oasis Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento OASIS,  Est\u00e1  compuesto por ocho integrantes todas mujeres,   la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

Her daughters and sons are married. Khaliskhan's eldest son has a disability. \r\n\r\nKhaliskhan has higher pedagogical education. For a period of 30 years she worked as a teacher at the local school, relentlessly bringing up the younger generation. Khaliskhan is known as a principal, honest and good-hearted person. Her long experience and dedication to her work earned Khaliskhan great respect among the villagers. \r\n\r\nWhen retiring, Khaliskhan decided to not sit back, and since 2003, searching for a source of income for her family, she started her business of livestock breeding on her farm, and also doing field crop cultivation. After having started with 6,000 som (KGS), her business currently brings in a monthly income in the amount of 8,000 som (KGS). Khaliskhan has two dairy cows with offspring on her farm. She also has a plot of land of 0.51 hectares, where she mainly grows potato, onion, peppers and sweet corn. Khaliskhan invested the income from the business in increasing the number of cattle on her farm. \r\n\r\nTo further develop her business, Khaliskhan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cows. Khaliskhan plans to spend the income from the loan on increasing the number of cattle, and in the future she also intends to purchase an apartment for her son.

Her husband and her youngest son help her with her business. As the main income for her family, Orozbubu works with fattening calves for further reselling, after having started 20 years ago with purchasing cattle for 6,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Orozbubu's persistent work, her farm currently has three cows, two calves, 40 sheep and also a plot of land of 2.0 hectares. There she plants barley and hay every year. The monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Orozbubu turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partner\" for a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) for purchasing calves for fattening and reselling.

She completed 6th grade and is married to a teacher. Together they have a seven-year-old child who is attending school and lives at home. Matu sells cassava, coal by the bag, and corn. She learned this business by working for her friend nine years ago. Matu is requesting a loan of 12,000 Liberian dollars to buy more cassava, coal by the bag, and corn to increase her sales. She reports that the rainy season is the biggest challenge she faces since she does not have an indoor shop. She values her business because it makes her independent and through it she earns her own money. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to live a better life, and she hopes that one day her child can become president.

This is Patrick's very first loan cycle with HOPE Congo and he is looking forward to expanding his shop and business, which he has been running since 2003. Patrick says his biggest challenge so far is the increasing prices that he must pay for the inventory for his store and states that this loan will help to reinforce the total capital of his business. Patrick also loves to talk about Jesus with other people in his community and his loan group.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Patrick hopes to continue to grow his activities so that he can increase his current shop and ultimately to become a successful businessman in Brazzaville.

He is the leader of the group, which consists of eight micro-entrepreneurs from Brazzaville, Congo. Cesar is married with three children, ranging in age from 3 to 16 years old. This is Cesar's very first loan cycle with HOPE Congo and he is going to use his loan to purchase a used vehicle that he will disassemble for used parts to resell to his customers. One of the challenges that Cesar faces since he started his business in 2004 is that often his customers are looking for unique items to purchase from his store and it is difficult to find the necessary stock when customers ask for parts. The purchase of the vehicle will allow him to offer more parts, especially unique parts, to his clients. In the future, Cesar hopes to continue to grow his activities and diversify into activities other than spare vehicle parts. Additionally, the increased income that he hopes to earn from his business will be put towards constructing a new home for him and his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4800,"image":{"id":1413948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase a previously used car to use as additional spare parts for his store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T21:10:06Z","loan_amount":4800,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"St\u00e8ve Pichastre","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seraphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miakakela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stetieiene Avertie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henriette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":2350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":134600},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":135900},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":139100},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140600},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":142800},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":144200},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":145800},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":147500},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":149000},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150800},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":152400},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":154400},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":156100},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":157900},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":161400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":301.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":311.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1990.88,"local_amount":974700,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":979403.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410109336,"comment":null},{"amount":1211.43,"local_amount":593100,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":595961.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874209,"comment":null},{"amount":1268.02,"local_amount":620800,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":623795.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429522863,"comment":null},{"amount":329.67,"local_amount":161400,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":162178.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439746784,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-04T23:13:59Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:34:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597456,"name":"Batu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Batu from Liberia.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.

the meaning of her name implies, is always smiling, kind and friendly.  She works as a seamstress.  She sews beautiful traditional Tajik dresses for women.  She is also a skilled embroiderer and she creates various patterns with beads, making decorative flower patterns to embellish her dresses.  She has a certain number of customers, whom she is always happy to serve.  She mainly sews at home, having transformed a small room into a studio which has become her world of art and where she creates beautiful dresses, giving life to her fabrics.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her talent as a seamstress, Hursand is a loving mother.  Her children are already grown-ups.  Her oldest son left for Russia to make a living and sends money home every month.  Hursand is now responsible not only for her own family, but also for her son's family.  As a caring mother and grandmother, her strongest desire is to see her children happy and she does everything to make this happen.\r\n\r\nHursand wants to repair the house where her large family lives.  However, the money that she makes thanks to her sewing business is not sufficient to perform home repairs.  This is the reason why she has turned to MDO Arvand, requesting a loan to buy building materials for the renovation of her house.  She hopes to receive some support from MDO Arvand and Kiva, and she thanks her lenders in advance for their help."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":240.85,"image":{"id":1414442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to buy building materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hursand","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":58},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":60.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":64.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":67.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":72.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.43},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58,"local_amount":58,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136795,"comment":null},{"amount":59.45,"local_amount":59.45,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":59.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900993,"comment":null},{"amount":60.94,"local_amount":60.94,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":60.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550175,"comment":null},{"amount":62.46,"local_amount":62.46,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774397,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-24T19:49:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599674,"name":"Julio Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio, se le presenta la necesidad de optar por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo porque requiere agregar el rubro de venta de mariscos, ya que se lo administrara su cu\u00f1ado, adem\u00e1s adquirir algunas herramientas para la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda; esta inversi\u00f3n le ayudara a comprar pescado, camar\u00f3n, conchas; tambi\u00e9n una cuchara para trabajar en construcci\u00f3n.\nEl cr\u00e9dito anterior fue positivo, ya que logro completar la comprar de  un veh\u00edculo  y algunos repuestos.

He is married and has three children. \r\n\r\nAs his neighbors say, Tursun is successful, conscientious, honest, and dedicated. Tursun works a lot to provide consistent income for his family. For that reason, he runs his own business. Actually, he runs two businesses simultaneously. At first, he started with a small business fattening and reselling cattle. Now, he has grown his business so much that he raises his own cattle. Income from his business has been good, but he got the idea to grow his own crops to reduce spending by feeding this cattle home-grown feed.\r\n\r\nBy now, Tursun has a large harvest and a large amount of feed for cattle. Because of this, it is now necessary to increase the number of cattle. For this, Tursun applied for a loan from Arvand to buy a few additional cattle. The loan will help him grow his business and increase his family's income.

is 40 years old. She is married and has two children aged 20 and 18. In 2002, she started a business in cow's milk sales. Working seven days a week and four hours a day, she supports her family.\r\n\r\nMuya has already received and successfully repaid six loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy a young dairy cow. Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.\r\nOn average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 litres of milk each day. In the local market, a litre of milk sells for about USD $0.40. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.

She has five years of experience in her line of work, which is making and selling tortillas.  She has partially completed her education.  She lives in a common-law relationship, and her partner works in an automotive repair shop.  They have 2 dependant children who are aged 5 and one, and who are not yet in school.  She owns a business that sells tortillas, which is an activity that she learned from her mother.  She decided to start her business out of a need to support and educate her children.  She works out of her home so that she does not pay taxes, and together with her life partner she is thinking about increasing her income.  The loan that she is requesting is to buy corn and have a reserve supply, because it is bought by the pound, and by buying wholesale she can improve her earnings.  In addition to this she will buy firewood and other supplies that she needs to expand her business.  She hopes that this will result in better earnings and an improvement in her quality of life, as she can acquire better housing.   She has decided to grow her business little by little by investing in it to improve it.  In the future she hopes that her children will obtain at least a technical diploma, and that she can build an adequate home, since she does not have sufficient financial resources.

","en":"Ranojon was born and raised in a rural area. She is a very harworking woman, as she helped her parents around the house and in the fields since childhood. Ranojon is 42 years old, married, and has three children. Her husband is a rural doctor. She gets along well with her husband - they understand each other. They try to work together to provide themselves and their children with all their needs. They have a very friendly, hardworking, and joyful family. The parents' actions provide an example for the children. \r\n\r\nTo help her husband earn money, Ranojon began her own small business, which she is gradually expanding. She has a small store near her house, where she sells groceries. In rural areas there is a lot of work to do in the summer: everyone goes out to the fields in the morning and returns in the evening. The location of Ranojon's store is convenient for her neighbors, and they are happy with it. \r\n\r\nRanojon would now like to expand her business to earn a larger income. She wants to expand the types of goods she has on the shelves. To do this she came to Arvand and would like a loan to buy groceries for future sale. Ranojon hopes for good results, and thanks you in advance for the financial support. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1411951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy grocery products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ranojon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":364.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":376.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":387.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":399.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":412.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":424.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":437.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":451.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":465.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":479.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":494.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":509.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":525.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":541.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":558.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":575.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":594.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597683,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is married with 5 children.

He is married and has two children. He and his wife are happy together - he loves her and their children very much. Hafizullo has a military university education, and he works as an officer in a military unit. He earns a good stable income. Hafizullo is a good and responsible man. His wife does not work, as she stays home to care for their children, and always has a lot to do since they live in a rural area. Since they live a bit far from the city, transportation is often difficult for Hafizullo. He has long wanted to buy his own car, but he hasn't yet been able to accumulate enough money. The salary he earns from his work mostly goes toward feeding the family, so it is hard to save money to buy consumer goods and more expensive items. Hafizullo decided to take out a loan for consumer goods. He came to Arvand and is requesting a loan to buy a car. Having his own car will make transportation much easier. Hafizullo is thankful to Arvand for the financial support. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1410025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to buy a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T02:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T02:00:07Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hafizullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":115.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":118.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":121.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":127.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":131.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":134.61},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":138.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":141.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":145.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":149.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":152.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597688,"name":"Eulalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eulalia is a 51-year-old, married woman from Talibon, Bohol.

Her mother also taught her to sew. Unfortunately Rukya was not able to go to college because of her family's financial hardship. However, she was able to learn sewing well, and now that is her primary business, and earns her a good income. Rukya is a dressmaker and seamstress. She has many regular clients. This work supports her and feeds her family. She dreams of having a good home so that the family could live better and more comfortably. The house where she lives now is not in good condition, so Rukya would like to do some remodeling. She is planing to do major repairs, but she needs a lot of money, and what she has from her business is only enough for food. Because of that, she decided to apply a loan for the repairs. To do that she came to Arvand and is hoping to receive a loan for building materials. She hopes for and believes that she will have good results, and she thanks Arvand in advance for the support. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1410385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rukiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":489.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":505.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":522.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":540.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":558.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":577.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":597.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":617.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":638.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":660.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":682.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":705.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":729.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":754.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":780.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":806.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":832.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598137,"name":"Mahoutin L\u00e9ontine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mahoutin L\u00e9ontine \u00e2g\u00e9e de 40 ans est veuve.

She is divorced from her husband and has one son. Her son is currently in Russia, where he works at a construction site and receives a good income which he sends each month to his mother. Mujibakhon is trying to raise her son to be a \r\nworthy man and does not want him to lack anything he needs. Because of this she herself works to earn money. She works on a farm, which earns her a small income. She has been dreaming for a long time of having a comfortable house where she can live with her son and his wife. Her house needs major repairs, and Mujibakhon would like to do a good remodeling, but she will need a lot of money to do it. The income that she and her son earn cannot cover all expenses and it would take a long time to save the needed sum. Because of this, in order to do a remodeling of her house she decided to request a loan to buy the needed building materials right away and quickly begin work. She turned to Arvand for the loan and is hoping for a good result.

She and her husband are raising four children.  She has a secondary education and works as an orderly at the local hospital.  Her husband is employed by the same hospital and works as a gardener.  Toktokan's oldest son is married and making a living in Moscow.  He helps his parents financially, sending them money every month in Kyrgyzstan.  The couple's other children are still in school.\r\n\r\n(In addition to her hospital job), Toktokan is also involved in animal husbandry, which provides her family with an additional source of income.  She started in this business 20 years ago using an initial capital of 10,000 som (KGS)  to buy livestock.  Thanks to her hard work and to the support of her close-knit family, Toktokan now owns one horse as well as 15 head of small livestock, and she makes a monthly income of 3,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her animal husbandry business, she has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to increase her herd by purchasing one head of cattle.  She plans to invest her earnings from this loan into further increasing her livestock headcount.  She is also planning to save enough money for her son's wedding ceremony."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":251.47,"image":{"id":1415020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulcha village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Toktokan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2832},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2915},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3087},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3177},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3270},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3366},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3464},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3565},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3669},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3776},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3879}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.61},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":122.12,"local_amount":5747,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5920.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014111,"comment":null},{"amount":63.75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3090.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777176,"comment":null},{"amount":65.6,"local_amount":3087,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3180.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427010,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-13T16:58:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598329,"name":"Essi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Afin d'acheter plus de c\u00e9r\u00e9ales pour revendre, madame Essi mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un maitre ma\u00e7on et maman d'un enfant de 05ans scolaris\u00e9 demande un premier pr\u00eat \u00e0 WAGES.

She and her husband are raising three children.  She has a higher education and works as a teacher at the local school.  Kimsan's husband works as a tractor driver.  Her oldest son sells cell-phones.  Her other two children are still in school.\r\n\r\n(In addition to her teacher's job), Kimsan is also involved in animal husbandry, which provides her family with an additional source of income.  She started in this business 15 years ago, using 16,000 som (KGS) to buy some livestock.

She is married to Juan, with whom she has three children, ages 6 and 4 years old, and 9 months. They live in their own house. Juanita\u2019s work consists mainly of selling a variety of sweets. She has a stand on the road in front of her house, which is located near a bridge with a lot of traffic and she has a lot of opportunity for sales. She feels her business does very well because of all the people that pass by, from children who come and go from a nearby school, and her own neighbors, who always come by to buy something they want. She also sells soft drinks and a variety of fruits during the week. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this same work for about 10 years and she has always worked by herself. She very much likes what she does because she has always liked to interact with customers. She explains that it has been complicated for her to establish her small business because she used to sell clothing, but people didn\u2019t pay her on time, so that made her afraid to start another business. In spite of this, she never gave up and now she has a lot of plans for her current business. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting 800.00 PEN (Peruvian nuevos soles). She is grateful to all the people who make her loan possible so that she can continue with her goals. She pledges to make her repayments in a punctual manner. She will use the loan to buy cookies, caramels, chocolates, chewing gum, puffed cheese snacks, lollipops, and other sweets so she can continue working. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":192.45,"image":{"id":1417320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cookies, caramels, chocolates, chewing gum, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juanita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":123.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":126.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":126.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":136.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":141.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":145.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.28,"local_amount":123.41,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":130.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865300,"comment":null},{"amount":47.6,"local_amount":126.94,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":133.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353681,"comment":null},{"amount":47.42,"local_amount":126.45,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":133.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905443,"comment":null},{"amount":51.15,"local_amount":136.39,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":143.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091429,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-27T03:44:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599815,"name":"Flor De Cardamomo Campamac Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Domingo es casado, tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad, no le dieron la oportunidad de estudiar ya que tenia que ayudar a sus padres con el trabajo, tiene 5 hijos y 4 de ellos estan estudiando, se dedica a la agricultura, espec\u00edficamente a la siembra de cardamomo, inici\u00f3 este negocio desde ni\u00f1o ayudando a sus padres y hasta la fecha lleva 35 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nOrganiza un grupo y solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 para la limpieza de cardamomo, desea en el futuro proximo tener mas terreno para sembrar cardamomo.

is a 55-year-old woman who is married to Daniel, a 55-year-old man. They have been blessed with four sons: Victor, a 30-year-old policeman; Frangky, a 25-year-old entrepreneur; James, a 23-year-old college student; and Mario, a 20-year-old who graduated from high school.\r\n\r\nMarselina initiated a pig-breeding business in 2009. Nowadays, she has three pigs. These pigs bear three times a year, and commonly a pig brings forth 10-12 piglets per birthing. Usually she sells the piglets in the amount of 750,000 IDR (Indonesian rupiah) each. The income from the business enables her to support the needs of her family, as her husband has gone through an early retirement because of sickness. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Marselina desires to raise more piglets, which means that she needs more stock of fodder. Her lack of money has led her to ask for an individual loan from TLM in amount of 10,000,000 IDR. The loan will be spent on the fodder, and to pay her son's school fee. She hopes that the loan will help her to be successful in her business.

Based on tradition, he works in agriculture. He is a very hard worker who does a lot in order to earn a living.  He has a greenhouse where he plants and grows vegetables to use for for his family. He also owns land in the mountain, where he has trees to sell as wood for heating during the winter time. In addition, he owned a cow, but recently had to sell it as he was in need of the money for his family. It is in these ways that he attempts to earn enough money to provide for his family\u2019s basic needs. Now for the first time, he is requesting a loan in order to buy another cow.

The only source of income for the family is the monthly salary earned by Irma\u2019s husband working as a truck driver locally. He works hard all day long to generate an income but the family needs more and Irma decided to start a fast food caf\u00e9 to earn additional income. \r\n\r\nSeveral times, she has requested loans from local credit providers, but her loan requests are always rejected because of the lack of experience in her new business. Her current loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. With the startup credit, Irma will set up a fast food caf\u00e9. She will purchase all the needed inventory and renovate her own commercial space to start business there. She will sell sandwiches, pies, and fizzy drinks.

Carlos makes a living selling fresh fish.  To do this he gets up very early and goes to the nearest port to buy his merchandise.  Then he goes to the settlements and new towns where he makes his sales as a street vendor, walking through the streets with his tray of fish.  \r\n\r\nHe began this more than two years ago with his own capital and so far he works alone.  He decided to start this business because he needed a job to rely on and to make an income in order to cover the expenses of his family.

Janargul raises livestock, which is the family's main source of income.  She started this business 12 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 16,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to the hard work of Janargul and her family, her farm now has two cows and 15 sheep and goats, which bring in a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Janargul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to increase her head of livestock by purchasing sheep and goats.  She plans to use the income from this loan to increase her head of livestock, and she also plans on saving up money to buy a car."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1415027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken - Jilga village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T13:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T13:20:04Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janargul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":840}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-24T20:21:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597777,"name":"Elpedia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elpedia is a 49-year-old married woman and a mother of three children.

He will do this in order to give continuity to his business and to be able to deliver the orders that he has on time.  This will allow him to increase his clientele, which brings an increase in orders and then income.  \r\n\r\nHe will do this in order to continue paying the family expenses and to move towards fulfilling his main dream.

She is a pensioner and has a high school education.  Three of her children are migrant workers in Russia and they help Kaliya by sending money home, and her youngest son lives with his mother and actively helps her around the house.  As the main source of income for her family, Kaliya raises livestock, which she started doing 20 years ago by purchasing livestock for 15,000 som KGS.  Thanks to the hard work of Kaliya and her youngest son, their farm now has one dairy cow and 20 head of sheep and goats, which bring in a monthly income of 3,000 som (KGS).

Jessica's dream is to one day open her own clothing business or a store in her house. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":129.27,"image":{"id":1417352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase firewood and 7 sacks of corn, as well as pay off a balance owed to Fundaci\u00f3n Campo.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T16:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T16:00:11Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica Beatr\u00edz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":30.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":30.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":33.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":34.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":37.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":39.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":47.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":53.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.62,"local_amount":30.62,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":30.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090882,"comment":null},{"amount":32.03,"local_amount":32.03,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":32.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856878,"comment":null},{"amount":34.29,"local_amount":34.29,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":34.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505146,"comment":null},{"amount":32.33,"local_amount":32.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":32.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716226,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T15:42:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597869,"name":"Baha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Baha is a 27-year-old, single man from a small village.
