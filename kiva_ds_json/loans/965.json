They live in their own house, which they built in an annex farm. Nerida is a young fighter. Her activity is agriculture for five years. With her partner, she is dedicated to intensive farm work. Also, she has to take care of her children and her home. \"The work is tiring, but if we don't work, there's no money\", says wisely. \r\n\r\nIn land she owns, she grows potatoes, peas, and beans. When the work is strenuous, she has to hire laborers to clean up the land. But on weekends, she takes the tools and heads to her farm to take care of it.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She buys supplies at wholesale and sells them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLetecia hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been running this business for two years with the help of her children.  \r\n\r\nShe complements this work with carpentry.  She developed this skill in the workshop of an acquaintance and noticed that this field is very profitable, so she would like to dedicate herself to this career completely because she feels she already has the basic knowlege to take it to the next level.  She likes this work because  she can be in her house during the time necessary to care for her children without neglecting her work duties.  She also likes the income that her job generates because she can support her spouse with the household expenses.  She has plans to increase the stock and variety of products in her store so her can please her customers.  In addition, she would like to buy second-hand tools so she can work as a carpenter.  \r\n\r\nThis is loan number 9 with MFP.

alimentaci\u00f3n, vive en la casa de su madre junto a su pareja y sus dos hijos en donde lucha d\u00eda a d\u00eda por salir adelante. Alicia trabaja vendiendo carnes rojas. Principalmente ofrece a la venta carne de cerdo y eventualmente carne de res. Consigue diariamente todo su producto del centro de abastecimiento de carnes certificadas para el consumo humano. Tiene su puesto de ventas ubicado en uno de los principales mercados de la ciudad hasta donde traslada las carnes que ha solicitado previamente con un d\u00eda de anticipaci\u00f3n. La demanda por este tipo de carnes es alta lo cual le permite tener siempre buenas ventas diarias aunque algunas veces no consiga vender todo lo que ofrece al culminar el d\u00eda. Antes de emprender este negocio se dedicaba a vender pescado fresco, sin embargo opt\u00f3 por cambiar de actividad debido a la rentabilidad que observ\u00f3 en el trabajo que ahora tiene y desde entonces han pasado 9 a\u00f1os trabajando sola y todo marcha bien para ella. \nLo que le gusta de su trabajo es el compa\u00f1erismo que existe entre los comerciantes que trabajan en el mismo rubro que ella, todos se apoyan mutuamente buscando conseguir nuevos clientes. Las ganancias que obtiene por sus ventas le ayudan a solventar los gastos de su hogar y adem\u00e1s le permite ahorrar para algunos imprevistos, sin embargo ahora su meta es establecer una tienda de abarrotes en su casa para que atiendan sus hijos y puedan colaborar con ella para generar los recursos econ\u00f3micos. Este es el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 14 con MFP, est\u00e1 muy agradecida por la oportunidad crediticia que le brindan y por el respaldo financiero que necesita para seguir adelante. Se compromete a pagar sus cuotas mensuales de manera puntual y continuar trabajando con mucha responsabilidad junto a los miembros de su banco comunal. \nCon el monto solicitado 4000 soles, mejorar\u00e1 la infraestructura de su puesto de ventas y comprar\u00e1 mayor cantidad de carnes, asimismo comprar\u00e1 algunos abarrotes de primera necesidad para establecer poco a poco su tienda de abarrotes. \n\n","en":"Alicia, 41, is a very kind, cheerful, hard-working woman who lives with her common-law husband and two children, 19 and 15, who are dependent on them for their education and food.  They live in her mother's house where they work hard every day to get ahead.  Alicia sells red meats, mainly pork and sometimes beef.  Every day she buys all her products at the wholesale market which sells certified meat for human consumption.\r\n\r\nHer stall is located in one of the main markets of the city and that is where she takes all the meat ordered the day before.  The demand for this type of meat is high, which means sales are always good.  Sometimes, though, she does not sell everything by the end of the day.  Before setting up this business she sold fresh fish.  She decided to change because she noticed that the business she is in now is more profitable.  For nine years she has been working alone and things are going well.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys about her work is the fellowship that exists among the merchants in her same line of business.  They all help each mutually to attract new customers.  The earnings from her sales help cover household expenses and allow her to save for any unexpected expense.  But, now her goal is to open a grocery store in her home for her children to run and help her out by generating extra income.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 14th loan through MFP and she is very grateful for the loan opportunity and financial backing she needs to get ahead.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time and continue working responsibly with the other members of her communal bank.\r\n\r\nThe 4,000 PEN will be used to improve her stall's infrastructure and to buy more meat.  She will also buy essential groceries to start setting up her grocery store little by little.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1211352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"To buy wholesale meat and essential groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-10T09:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-09T09:50:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":579.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":639.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":663.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":667.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":712.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":736.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":276.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":472.44,"local_amount":1219.21,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1228.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053617,"comment":null},{"amount":257.02,"local_amount":663.27,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":668.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188554,"comment":null},{"amount":258.8,"local_amount":667.87,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":672.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572468,"comment":null},{"amount":276.25,"local_amount":712.91,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":718.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122130,"comment":null},{"amount":285.49,"local_amount":736.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":742.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867966,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She displays her merchandise at the small markets, at her home and sometimes on the side of the road leading to the avenues. She started her business with her own funds, received from her boyfriend, and sold fish (Mikeke) coming from Uvira. Later on, she benefited from extra funding in the form of loans from MFI Hekima. She has been in this business for 2 years.\r\n\r\nZuena has just completed 4 loans cycles with the Hekima microfunding program. The insecurity in the province's interior is threatening the development of her business. This new loan should allow her to buy items like 50 kg of rice, 50 kg of sugar, fish and soap, and the rest of the money will be spent on her children's education. She would also like to see her children grow up, and buy a house and a car.\r\n\r\nThe customer thanks Hekima for its actions helping impoverished women achieve economic and financial

He dedicates himself to his work so he can feed and educate his children, not to mention that he wants to give his whole family a better quality of life.

He has done this job for more than 10 years, and it has given him the opportunity to grow little by little along with his family, but he has bigger dreams for the future. In addition to this work, he also sells alcoholic beverages, soft drinks and gelatins from his home. In the same vein, he built rooms on some space on his land that he can rent by the month at very good prices. What he likes most about his job is that he can take his children to school, transport his family and carry out other work responsibilities. He hopes that his businesses progress even more in the future, since he wants to develop another one raising chickens, although he needs to save a bit more money first. This will be his first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he is grateful for those who made this possible so he can continue toward achieving his goals. He also promises to make his payments on time. He enjoys being part of his community bank because all of the members are responsible people who stand by each other.

They live in the Salcedo canton, located in the eastern part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces of the Ecuadorian sierra. In Salcedo there are various tourist attractions such as lakes and beaches that offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists. Nonetheless, the main activity in this town is farming and to a lesser extent, livestock. The farming products that are sold the most are grains, such as peas, beans, lentils, lima beans and various fruits and vegetables. Milk and milk products are sold locally and what is left over is sent to the coast as processed products. Raising animals is also very favorable because of the pleasant climate enjoyed in the canton. Despite these productive activities, there are worrisome levels of illiteracy and poverty and a lack of basic necessitites such as sewer services, which only 25% of homes have.\r\n \r\nYolanda raises domestic animals such as pigs and guinea pigs. She also is a farmer. She works 8 hours a day and has 15 years experience in the business. With the experience she has acquired so far, she feels capable of growing her business and that is why she has asked for a loan to buy more animals and invrease her income. She hopes to be able to go back to school and give her children a higher quality of life. She is very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the support it has offered the rural sector and also for the training and consulting it offers to manage resources in a better way."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1209962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy animals and increase her sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salcedo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-10-10T11:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-09T11:10:01Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1056,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":102.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":103.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":104.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":107.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":108.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":109.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":111.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":112.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.29},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.29,"local_amount":95.57,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":97.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382702,"comment":null},{"amount":102.27,"local_amount":100.46,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":102.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989787,"comment":null},{"amount":104.18,"local_amount":102.34,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":104.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126193,"comment":null},{"amount":105.29,"local_amount":103.43,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":105.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516795,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":107.45,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":109.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068652,"comment":null},{"amount":109.52,"local_amount":107.58,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":109.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494921,"comment":null},{"amount":447.07,"local_amount":439.17,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":447.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524849,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-10T16:23:21Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":480316,"name":"Na's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Na is 36 years of age, married, and blessed with two children.

age 67, is a teacher and a farmer in the district of Akhmeta in East Georgia. She lives with her son, her daughter-in-law, and a granddaughter, who is a student. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they have a small dairy farm of four milk cows, whose milk is used for dairy production. Liana produces cheese to sell to local cheese retailers. In addition, they grow maize on a family-owned land. The harvested production is used to support the family needs. Liana and her daughter-in-law are also teachers at the local school, where they earn monthly salaries.\r\n\r\nLiana works hard, but the family still does not produce enough income to build savings and improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan in order to repair a cattle-shed. With the loan funds, she will purchase construction materials for building the shed. The existing one is too small and does not allow Liana to plan future expansion of the family\u2019s farming activities. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she intends to develop an animal husbandry business so that she can produce and sell more cheese. This will increase the family income and Liana will be able to finance the education of her granddaughter.

Perveen is a 39 year old married woman. She has been doing business selling milk for many years. Her husband also assists in selling milk to door-to-door. She has six children.  Her husband had been the only earner of the family. She decided to help her husband in managing the household, purchased a buffalo 10 years ago, and started selling milk. Now she has a good client list.

from Sierra Leone! This is 38-year-old Betty from Moriba town in the southern area of Bo, Sierra Leone. She is married with three children between the ages of 3 years and 15 years. Her children attend school. She began this business because she wants to take good care of her family.\r\n\r\nBetty runs a dried fish business within a business market area. She sells dried fish. She has been running this business for 10 years. She works at the business every day; she will start to smoke the fish from 11:00 p.m. until the fish get dry. She also has two relatives who help her to run the business. Her business is the only income she has. Betty says that the main challenges to her business are the cost of transport and insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nBetty has requested a loan in order to buy more fish for sale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and open a savings account. In the future, she plans to export dried fish and build a house for her family. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1209842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Pero, Immer tambi\u00e9n comercializa sandia, cubriendo diferentes rutas, sale de su casa a las 4:00 a.m. \n\nImmer actualmente recicla oro, tiene diferentes rutas, posee clientes preferentes, eso lo hace diferenciarse de los dem\u00e1s que se dedican al mismo negocio. \n\nEl prestamos que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para cancelar una deuda con la instituci\u00f3n y la otra parte para comprar material y revenderlo en la joyer\u00edas; debido a que a veces con un solo cliente obtiene buenas ganancias y en este momento no posee suficiente dinero para trabajar. Con el pr\u00e9stamo espera cubrir una nueva zona geogr\u00e1fica, su deseo es comprar una motocicleta, ya que es mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil para comprar oro seg\u00fan lo manifiesta \u00e9l, pero lo que mas desea es comprar su propio terreno y construir su casa ah\u00ed. \n\n","en":"Immer, 24, is married and has two children.  He lives on land belonging to his father that he built his house on.  He\u2019s been working recycling materials for about four years.  Before that he was a mechanic and worked repairing vehicle mufflers and radiators.  However, noting that working recycling materials was a good fit for him, he tended more towards this business.  He\u2019s a very optimistic merchant because recycling doesn\u2019t always produce high profits but Immer also sells watermelons along a variety of routes; he leaves home at 4am.  He\u2019s currently recycling gold.  He has various routes and has special, regular customers which differentiate him from others who are in the same kind of business.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to repay a debt with the institution and the other part is to buy material to resell to jewelry stores because sometimes he earns good profits with just one customer and he currently doesn\u2019t have enough money to work.\r\n\r\nHe hopes the loan will help him cover new territory.  He wants to buy a motorcycle because it\u2019s much easier to buy gold according to him but what he most wants is to buy a piece of land of his own and build his house there.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1211624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"to repay a loan and to buy merchandise to resell to jewelry stores.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-10-10T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-09T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Immer Josue","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":64.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":64.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":67.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":69.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":72.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":76.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":79.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":85.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":87.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":92.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":99.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.11},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479106,"name":"Houweida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"My name is Houwaida.

Mahfirat wants to set up a business baking and selling flatbread. She plans to use the income she earns to improve her living conditions. Her husband will assist her in running the business.

This will help increase milk production and thereby improve her income, which will enable her to pay school fees for her child. Josephine also aspires to build residential houses in the near future, a venture that will provide an additional source of income that will help to boost her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nJosephine's main challenges in farming are crop failure, pests, and diseases.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful for Juhudi Kilimo and calls it the best micro-finance institution for small-scale farmers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1210207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy materials for constructing a zero grazing unit for her dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2012-10-10T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-09T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2952.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2876.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3831.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3733.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3192.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3543.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3637.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3110.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3363.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3452.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3276.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":264.88,"local_amount":22306.03,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":22462.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768211,"comment":null},{"amount":41.35,"local_amount":3482.29,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3506.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516295,"comment":null},{"amount":43.04,"local_amount":3624.34,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3649.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960641,"comment":null},{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":3720.14,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3746.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820359,"comment":null},{"amount":61,"local_amount":5136.96,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5172.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410981039,"comment":null},{"amount":20.55,"local_amount":1714.26,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:48:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1726.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419881138,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-11T01:27:48Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T16:48:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":481402,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":679.06,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy primary materials like wood, lacquer, sandpaper and others for furniture making as well as to buy construction materials to remodel and expand his workshop.

Nelly prepares stews and various foods, has a great talent, and is known as one of the women with the tastiest spices in town.  This is why her restaurant is one of the most well-known in the zone and why her customers go there daily to enjoy the tasty menus that she prepares with care and love.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s had a passion for the culinary arts since she was young, and in time she has developed her capacity and sense for improving her spices.  Now she knows the tastes that her customers prefer and she remembers how she began this work 30 years ago with fondness and pride.  She dreamed of having her own restaurant and with time she has seen her efforts pay off and she\u2019s gotten benefits that she can now enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is preparing the stews, enjoying the smells and tastes, and knowing that her loyal customers enjoy each dish that she offers.  She hopes to continue improving her restaurant\u2019s infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 16th loan through MFP and she appreciates those who make this loan possible so that she can continue toward her goals.

At 2:00 pm she goes to the plantation and she stays until 5:00 or 6:00 pm and then comes back home.

Victoria works hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVictoria operates a variety store which, in the Philippines, is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Victoria earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also has a cellphone loading station. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Victoria earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Victoria is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVictoria dreams of giving her family a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

is from a village in the Gardabani district. She is 46 years old and lives with her husband, son, daughter, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. Maia\u2019s husband works as a driver and her son is a worker. Both of them get a monthly income. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they have a small dairy farm with two milk cows, whose milk is used for dairy production. Maia produces cheese and sells it in the capital city's supermarket. Maia works hard, but her family still doesn't have enough income to make some savings and improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nMaia requested a loan to renovate her house.

from Sierra Leone!  This is 45 -year-old Bintu from Southern area in Bo. She is married and has 4 children between the ages of 10 years and 25 years. Three of her children attend school. She started this business to generate income in the home.\r\n\r\nBintu runs a provision shop at the house she lives.  She sells sugar, biscuit, mayonnaise, cocoa and ovaltine.   She has been running this business for 10 years. She works at the business every day.   Sleep is the only thing that will prevent her from opening her business. Her children usually help her to run the business.  She does not have any source of income except her business. Bintu says that her business is running well and that she does  not have any competition in the area.\r\n\r\nBintu has requested a loan in order to buy a variety of stock such as sugar, biscuits, mayonnaise, cocoa, and ovaltine.   Her goal is to own a permanent structure for her business.  In the future, she hopes to open a big supper market. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1210309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

All her loans were duly repaid.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to buy two bags of sugar, one box of vanilla sugar, 35 kg of ginger and one 50-kg bag of dah (a species of hibiscus used in infusions).

Seven years ago she started stitching clothing for people around her home. Today, she has gained a lot of appreciation and serves well in her community. However, due to fewer financial resources, she has been unable to fulfill the demands of customers. She contacted Kashf foundation to purchase raw materials to complete the orders on time. She is in her second loan cycle and has borrowed 25000 PKR from Kashf Foundation.

Her husband goes to five weekly markets of her locality in a week with bulk of items on a bike and sells in the market. Apart from this she has also a tent house business in her house. Her monthly income from the existing business is 8000 rupees. \n\nOut of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses and spent some income for the education of her children. She wants to increase stock levels of her business. So the loan will be utilized to purchase more of the items she sells in bulk to keep the stock up for a month. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently and she can add a substantial income to her present income. \n\nPhuldei hopes to increase the stock  to run her business smoothly with sufficient items and provide a better education to her children. The other five members of the group are Reema, Ramani, Chandrakala, Aniali and Nilendri who are running cloth and grocery shop businesses. \n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1194632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy onion, garlic, coriander, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kusurla,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-11T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-10T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aniali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phuldei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrakala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilendri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":184000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":184000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T21:32:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":474575,"name":"Lemalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lemalie is a 32-year-old woman who is married with 5 children.
