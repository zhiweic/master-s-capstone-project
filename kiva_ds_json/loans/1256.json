I have always had a dream to get a high qualification. I decided that AUCA is the best choice for me. In my opinion, this university offers very good conditions for study. It was not a problem for me to choose the most suitable university. But I found it a little bit problematic to select the faculty. After some contemplation I successfully made my choice, which is Economics. Comparatively recently I found out that I love working with numbers. Mathematics became my favorite subject. I am sure that AUCA will easily help to make me a highly qualified specialist. I would like to mention that AUCA gives many opportunities to its students and one of it is financial aid. I think it is the best way to communicate with students and attract such wonderful ideas and opportunities. I am applying for a Kiva loan, which will help me to cover my tuition

She's a member of La Source Group and the mother of three children, who all go to school. Her husband is a teacher in a private school.\r\n\r\nMadawa sells secondhand clothing. She sets up her point of sale in a busy location in her neighborhood, at the corner of an avenue.\r\n\r\nShe started her business with her husband's assistance. Later on, she obtained a loan from Kiva's partner, the MFI Hekima. She's been running her business for three years.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy one bale of secondhand clothing. Thus, she would like to provide an education for her children, expand her business, and build a nice home. Currency exchange losses are challenges for the development of her business.\r\n\r\nIn the end, she strongly thanks Hekima for its contribution to make women who are excluded by traditional banks self-supporting, especially during this critical time of war in the East of the country."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1930.1,"image":{"id":1465401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

They are a Mazahua community who preserve their mother tongue and their traditional clothing is very colourful and attractive. To get to the community it is only possible to go by special transport or on foot since the bus only goes a couple of times a day at strange times. The group is made up of 5 women who are good friends and have known each other for several years. Leticia or 'Lety' is 35 years old and has been married to Alejandro for 16 years. Together they have 2 children who are still at school. \r\n\r\nFor the last 10 years Lety has earned a living baking bread. She says she decided to go into this business as her in-laws were also bakers. Lety, her husband and other family members make the bread in a very small room where they have an oven. The whole process is done by hand and they have no tools. Every day Lety and her relatives can be found making their bread. The bread making process is very laborious and while they are working the oven needs to be very hot so that it is ready for the bread to go in. To make the bread they need to weigh the flour in order to calculate the quantity of sugar. They only use flour and sugar mixed with water to make their bread rolls. Lety said: \" Our difficulties are the lack of tools to make our work easier, the price of flour is very expensive as well and the price of sugar is going up a lot.\"\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the loan which Lety, Silvia, Irene, Aracely and Cristina are asking for from Kiva and Vision Fund will help them a great deal since they will be able to buy flour and sugar for making the bread. The celebration of the Day of the Dead is approaching and this is when they sell the most and have already secured orders.\r\n\r\nThey are very happy and grateful because their loan will help them a lot and more so because their profits will be good. Lety's dream is to continue supporting her children in their schooling so that they can have a professional career."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":901.31,"image":{"id":1462912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Guadalupe Cote, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":4925,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aracely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":64000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5919.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6049.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6182.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6318.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":6457.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6599.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6744.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6892.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7043.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":445.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":455.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":465.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":486.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":496.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":507.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":530.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":542.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":901.31,"local_amount":11712.46,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":11756.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644496,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T21:56:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":627555,"name":"Nyevu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Nyevu, whose previous loan was a big help in her business.

He lives in a peaceful community known for its national festivals.  The inhabitants come from the \"mazahua\" indigenous tribe and keep up their mother tongue and brightly-coloured traditional clothes.  Arnulfo has had a grocery store for six years.  It first belonged to his grandfather, who worked there for 50 years.  However, when he died, no one worked in the shop for three years.  Arnulfo had promised his grandfather that he would keep the shop just as his grandfather had always kept it.    Previously, Arnulfo's grandfather's shop was in a house made of tiles and wood, with adobe walls (a material made with earth.  Arnulfo's grandfather build the house, and it is one of the oldest in the community.  The shelves, doors, and window frames were all made of wood.  For Arnulfo, this house has a lot of character, and he wants to keep it forever as it was a present from his grandfather.  Arnulfo has been running the shop for five years and he is very happy with it.  He has always liked working in sales as his father was a businessman too.  On this occasion Arnulfo is applying for a loan in order to buy items such as milk, bread, eggs, refreshments, detergents, and more. He needs this loan to buy more merchandise and so that the business does not collapse.  Arnulfo's current challenge is dealing with competition.  Arnulfo lives in the centre of his community but there are also two very big shops.  Arnulfo always tries to be very attentive with his customers so that they become loyal.  Arnulfo has never thought about leaving the business because he promised his uncle that he wouldn't.  Arnulfo's father used to have a ranch with many animals and Arnulfo would like to have more animals, such as pigs, oxen, and fighting cocks.  However, unfortunately, he had pigs who became infected with a virus, and he was unable to continue with this work.  Arnulfo would like to have more animals in the future and he is sure that he will manage it with the saving he will earn from the grocery store, from selling gas, and from selling roosters."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":348.34,"image":{"id":1462180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy milk, bread, eggs, soft drinks, sugar, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Barrio San Francisco, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arnulfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1463.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1497.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1532.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1568.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1604.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1642.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1680.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1719.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1760.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1801.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1843.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1886.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":348.34,"local_amount":4494.76,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4543.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644498,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-14T17:31:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":627594,"name":"Onesphore","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Onesphore is 42 years old.

They live in a very quiet community where the people generally make a living by growing corn. They chose this name for their group because where they live there is a stone quarry from which they quarry stone to build their houses. Francisca, or Fran as they call her in a friendly way, is a group member; she is 36 years old and has been living with Mr. Antonio for 10 years. They have two children together who are going to elementary school. Fran works breeding sheep; she fattens them and then sells them. She has been doing this for three years. She says that she started this business because, when they offered her the loan, she decided to buy sheep and also because it is very convenient for her; she doesn't need to invest a lot of time in it, when she has the time she takes her sheep to the pasture to graze and takes her children with her as well to play with them while the sheep are eating. The only problem Mrs. Fran has is that sometimes her sheep get sick. Whenever she can and has the means to do it, she takes her sheep to a veterinarian to save them.

Don Bruno has a taxi that he offers as public transportation. He started this business 10 years ago because he did not have a steady job.

Don Bruno sought support from a formal company so that they help with with the license plates for his taxis. The negotiations took four years before he finally received his concessions and license plates for his taxis. Don Bruno currently has one taxi that he uses every day for his work, but he also has additional vehicles that he makes available for rent to help other people have a job.

She's a single mother and lives with her daughter, her mother, her sister and her aunt.  They're a strong family who work hard to make better lives for themselves.\r\nMaria worked as a cleaner in the city for two years.  She also makes hammocks from cascarilla and silk.  She started making and selling hammocks--a skill she learned from her parents--when she was only 10 years old.  She still makes them and sells some to order and some for sale in the market. She has a farming and animal-sales business, as well.  \r\nMaria walks to the city every 15 or 22 days to buy what she needs for her hammock business.  It's a 30-minute walk along busy streets, but that's where she has to go to buy the supplies she needs.  She sells her products from her house.  She works every day of the week, starting with household chores (cooking, cleaning) and then moving on to making hammocks.  Her sister and her daughter help her with the business.  \r\nMaria is applying for a loan that she will use to improve her house and buy supplies for her business.  The walls are in bad shape and she will use $700 of the loan to buy materials--siding, tiles, wood, etc--and pay for labor.

She is from a humble family and has four siblings; she is the youngest. Growing up, her parents were farm workers and sold spices (achote, garlic, cinnamon, peppers, and others). She started selling these products at the age of 16. She learned to do it from her siblings and a cousin. She got married at the age of 20 and has five children, two of whom live with her. She and her two children work in agriculture. One of her sons went to work in the capital, another lives and works in the city, and a daughter lives in the same community with her spouse. Santos' youngest son decided to immigrate to the US a few months ago. Her husband has also lived in the US for several years. They are always in touch and he supports them.\r\nShe will invest this loan in the purchase of materials- tile, beams, and wood-to improve a room. Another part of the loan is for the repair of a roof over the bathrooms, because it is in very bad condition. She will also pay the labourers. In making these improvements, she will have a more comforable home for her family and the bathrooms will be more private.\r\nSantos' dream is to continue expanding her home and put in flooring. The floor is currently dirt. She wants to have a larger, more comfortable and dignified home for herself and her entire family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":136.02,"image":{"id":1464559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy tile, beams, and wood to improve a room, and to change the deteriorated roof in the bathrooms.

He wishes to invest the profits from his farming in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She tends to the business four days a week: Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 7 am to 1 pm. One of the challenges she faced was when she had just set up and she was left with no working capital as she had left the product with her customers and was unable to recover the money later on. However, this experience was worthwhile in order to not repeat it. Now thank to her business' income, she has been improving her home little by little even fitting out rooms for rent.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda became aware of the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa through neighbors who recommended it for the services that the institution offers.

As the autumn is progressing, Gohar needs to make some investments in her agribusiness in order for it to function in a sustainable way. A loan of USD 3,000 will support this young hard-working woman and her family greatly, enabling them to purchase some forage (grass and combined forage) for the livestock, and make previous credit repayments.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the loan, the family will maintain and develop their agribusiness. Gohar and her family members highly rely on the goodwill of the lenders and will be thankful to them for their support.

A loan of USD 3,000 will help him greatly, enabling him to purchase a car. The latter will help him organize his business in a more efficient way. Haykaz and his family members will highly appreciate the lenders support, and will be thankful to them for helping them collect the needed loan to sustain their small business.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Nicholas is pictured in the photograph with a UGAFODE staff member in a white shirt (left to right)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":166.67,"image":{"id":1463183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lyantonde","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":416666.66,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":420344.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863656,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-21T04:51:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":627900,"name":"Kimsrong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kimsrong, age 19 and unmarried, currently lives with her parents and siblings in Stueng Trang district, Kampong Cham province.

Huvaydo works in a nursery school as a child-minder. She likes her work a lot as she really loves children. However, Huvaydo receives a very low salary. This is why her son works in the Russian Federation. Her son sends her monthly remittances when possible.    \r\n\r\nFor a long time now, Huvaydo has wanted to build a house. Last year, she started construction but did not finish building it, as she did not have enough money on hand. Now Huvaydo plans to finish building her house, however she does not have enough money, which is why she turned to Arvand microcredit organization for a loan. It will soon turn cold and Huvaydo would like to finish building her house as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWith the received loan, Huvaydo plans to buy construction materials and hopes to finish her house before winter.

Rust is a disease that affects coffee plantings, and if it is not treated in time, it is possible that it will spread and the entire harvest will be lost.\r\n\r\nHer dreams for the future are to have a big coffee plantation which can continue to give them benefits and family sustenance and can be worked from generation to generation by her children and grandchildren, and the next generations can take advantage of the effort and dedication that she and her husband have applied. She would also like to be able to open a microbusiness to make chocolate to be able to stratify her income and generate others.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":133.31,"image":{"id":1464588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to buy agricultural supplies to apply to her coffee plantings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-07T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-06T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor Sarahi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.75,"local_amount":1355,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1385.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042252,"comment":null},{"amount":65.56,"local_amount":1311.25,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1340.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710599,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T03:32:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":627924,"name":"Alphonse","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alphonse is 40 years old.

This place is lush with vegetation and green meadows.  It is known as the city viewpoint as, from its highest point, you can admire the beauty of the city of Cuenca.  The people here in Turi are friendly and courteous, much like the members of the communal bank - they are also fighters, always working to improve financial stability in their lives and also help their families to prosper.  The people of Turi are proud to keep up the culture and traditions that they were taught by their parents.\r\n\r\nOne member of this group is Mar\u00eda Carmen, who has been with the communal bank for five years.  During this time, loans have helped her to improve her financial stability and to get ahead with her family.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Carmen is 37 years old.  She is married and, with her husband, has four children - aged 19, 17, 15, and 12 years old respectively.  The eldest is working and supports the household financially.  The other three children are studying at one of the schools in the city.  Mar\u00eda Carmen's husband works as a builder.  The couple owns the house they live in; they built it with a lot of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Carmen spends most of her time at home, where she does household chores.  She also works hard in the field as a farmer: she uses part of her harvest to feed her family, and the rest she sells.  In addition Mar\u00eda Carmen raises chickens, guinea pigs, and lambs.  At the weekend, she works fixing houses.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in buying chickens, guinea pigs, lambs, and in feed for the animals.  Mar\u00eda Carmen's goal is to finish her house as there are still a couple of small things to do.  Her other goal is for her children to become professionals.\r\n\r\nThe small photo in the image is of a member who could not be present when the group photo was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1191.65,"image":{"id":1464639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens, guinea pigs, lambs, and animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-11-07T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-06T12:20:01Z","loan_amount":3575,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Transito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Clementina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3565.72,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":297.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":595.83,"local_amount":594.28,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":595.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506507,"comment":null},{"amount":595.82,"local_amount":594.28,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":595.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730264,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-15T09:40:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":628774,"name":"Gabriel Arcangel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gabriel tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la c\u00e1lida ciudad de Nazca.
