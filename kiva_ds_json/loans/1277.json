By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

This will allow him to increase sales and profits he receives from them.\r\n\r\nOmar says that his main goal is to continue with his business but in a location nearer his home, so he can watch over his family and save money, not spending so much on daily transportation, which would result in better profits and financial stability and providing better welfare and living conditions for his family. \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1477991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a polisher and supplies at wholesale prices (paints and lacquers)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-28T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-27T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Omar Albeiro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59849},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61502},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63201},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64946},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66740},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68583},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70477},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72424},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74424},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76479},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78592},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80762},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82993},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85285},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87640},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90061},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92548},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95104},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97730},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100429},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103203},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106053},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108982},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111993}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.18},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.02},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639563,"name":"Joyeuse Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Ang\u00e9lique est une conseill\u00e8re de l\u2019association d\u2019affaire  \u00abJoyeuse\u00bb, senior entrepreneur exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e, dynamique, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 60 ans, veuve et m\u00e8re de 2 enfants qui sont tous mari\u00e9s.

The second, 9, is in 3rd grade; the third child is 4 and the youngest is 3 days old.\r\n\r\nShe is married, the husband works in the distribution of basic goods. He travels from the place where he lives to the city by car for forty minutes.\r\n\r\nLeydi has 9 years\u2019 experience owning a small store and she has it installed in her own house. This way, she can care for the family and it is a way of helping with the expenses of the home. The husband is involved as well, given that he is the one who brings the weekly purchases to the store.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy a female pig and the rest of the money will be for improving the pig pen, because it is very small where they are. At the same time it is another revenue she can expect. In this manner, she will help with expenses a little more because they are increasing with the arrival of another child.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that with this new income she will improve her quality of life, because she will have more income and therefore give her children what she didn\u2019t have. When she was young, she remarks that they were too poor: in total they were 7 siblings.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to continue working really hard to reach her proposed objectives: give her children the chance to study, so that they can confront life differently. She also has another dream which is to improve her humble home and she asks God for the life and strength to do it."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a female pig and improving the pig pen.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-28T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-27T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leydi Yasenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-21T21:08:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":638688,"name":"Fatmata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Fatmata, she is a 35-year-old from the Waterloo2 eastern area in Freetown.

Because of her husband's difficult personality, she divorced him and raised their three children alone. Her husband did not have anything to do with parenting the children, nor did he pay any support. After divorcing her husband and getting through depression, Buzeinep pulled herself together and vowed that she will be able to get on her feet and give her children everything they need in life. Buzeinep has a higher education. She works as a medical assistant in the district hospital, and to make additional income, Buzeinep works with livestock. She started thirteen years ago by buying 15,000 KGS worth of livestock. She is doing well, thanks to her hard work and persistent nature. Buzeinep's farm today boasts three milk cows and five sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, she approached the microfinance bank Bai - Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy sheep for fattening and resale. Buzeinep plans to use profits from the loan to increase her domestic animals and save enough money to repair her house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":60.15,"image":{"id":1480891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She and her husband are raising seven children. Toktobubu is a very happy person because of her seven children. All of the children grew up to be clever and obedient. Half of them are married and live on their own. The others help Toktobubu on the farm. The whole family is hardworking, and Toktobubu instilled a love of hard work in them during childhood. Toktobubu's husband is a farmer. Toktobubu has a secondary education. The family's primary source of income is animal husbandry. Toktobubu started this business 26 years ago when she bought 1,000 KGS worth of livestock. Through Toktobubu's hard work, her farm now boasts three dairy cows, ten horses, and 23 sheep. Toktobubu has everything needed for keeping livestock at home. With Toktobubu's guidance, they have procured about 1,000 bales of hay for the winter. Her monthly income is 17,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Toktobubu  approached the microfinance bank Bai - Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow for breeding.

Many years ago she went to her native city, where she currently lives.  She came in search of work opportunities and began working as a domestic employee at different homes once she got settled in.  She got tired of being taken advantage of, so she decided to sell fruits and vegetables on foot 17 years ago.  Thanks to the path she took in her work, she now has a stand on one of the main streets in the city center, where she sells fruits, natural juices, and other foods.  Her husband helps her and she is able to manage her own schedule and can plan her income.  She works Monday through Saturday from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm, facing different challenges and risks as a mobile merchant, such as the climate, pollution, and other things.

She learned to sew at a young age and by now has 10 years of experience with making dresses for women and children and also making small fabric household items based on her customers\u2019 needs. The small, income generating activity based in her home allows her to be flexible with the household duties as well as with the orders received from the clients. \r\n\r\nA major obstacle, however, is the fact that in her area power cuts are frequent and can last for many hours, with no regular patterns or predictability. This makes planning the work difficult, and also leaves her little time for the actual orders to be completed. To be able to better plan the work and deliver better quality services she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine. To be able to afford the purchases she is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group.\r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

She started the home based sewing business activity 5 years ago - making dresses for women and children and also making small fabric household items based on her customers\u2019 needs. The small, income generating activity based in her home allows her to be flexible with the household duties as well as with the orders received from the clients. \r\n\r\nA major obstacle, however, is the fact that in her area power cuts are frequent and can last for many hours, with no regular patterns or predictability. This makes planning the work difficult, and also leaves her little time for the actual orders to be completed.

She and her husband have four children. Her sons are now in Russia as migrant workers, and the youngest daughter attends secondary school. Darikhan has received secondary education. She works as a janitor at the village administrative office. As an additional source of income for her family, Darikhan raises livestock and gardens. She started this business 20 years ago by buying livestock for 3,000 KGS. Her husband helps her out on the farm.

She has never had any other source of income. \r\n\r\nShe works at home, but she often leaves the house to sell in the neighborhood. The biggest cost for her is bringing in the raw material in order to do her work: in order to bring it home, she has to travel 23 kilometers by car. Her mother helps occasionally, but due to her age she cannot work as much as she used to. The work day is 6 hours long.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Mayra is requesting will be used to buy a cow so that she can continue selling. This will increase her income as she will be able to sell more and help pay the household expenses. Mayra's dream is to find a stable job so that her family can have a dignified life. Her dream is to help her family to achieve their dreams and to see her son grow, study, and find a decent job. \r\n\r\nThis loan will help her sell more and meet the demand within her community. With an increased income, she will expand her business and put up a stall in the municipal market in order to sell more. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":60.71,"image":{"id":1478561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a cow in order to continue selling meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-28T22:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-27T22:30:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Del Transito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":27.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":29.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32.52},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33.39},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":37.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":38.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":41.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.71,"local_amount":60.71,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":60.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716536,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-05T07:03:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637996,"name":"Jose Israel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, solicita capital para pagar mano de obra para recolectar la cosecha de ma\u00edz, tambi\u00e9n adquirir\u00e1 materia prima para seguir elaborando hamacas, le servir\u00e1 para tener sus pedidos tanto de granos b\u00e1sicos como de las hamacas.\nCon el pr\u00e9stamo anterior \u00e9l tuvo el material necesario para elaborar una mayor cantidad de hamacas, atrajo a m\u00e1s clientes, sus ventas aumentaron y sus nuevos ingresos le han permitido salir de deudas y cambiar el estilo de vida de su famila.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is applying for this loan in order to pay labourers to harvest his corn.

Her husband died young and her children were left without their father and the main family breadwinner.  It was very hard for Nazgul to survive his death, but she finally got a hold of herself and found some work so she could feed her family.  She works in a bakery as a part-time packer on a rotational basis, but unfortunately her salary is not enough to support her family and as a source of additional income she decided to raise animals.  She started doing this 15 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 3,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, she now has two cows, ten sheep and she also has a 2.25 hectare plot of land on which she grows wheat and legumes.  Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of developing her business further, Nazgul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy bulls to fatten up and sell for a profit at the local market.  Nazgul is a very enterprising and industrious woman and she believes that she can do well for her family.  She plans to use the income from the loan to further increase her head of livestock and she also intends to raise money to improve her financial situation and to build a good future for her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He realizes the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of family\u2019s income. Gevorg\u2019s family members assist him greatly in his everyday activities related to farming. \r\n\r\nTo continue running his agribusiness in a sustainable way, Gevorg needs to make some investments. He particularly needs a loan of 3,000 USD to purchase fertilizers, buy tree layers, and pay for the harvesting services and the workforce.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

Her husband is a weaver and knits blankets at home. For knitting blankets wool is used as raw material. There is no better kind of the blankets than blankets made by hand; though this is far from implying that all hand-tufted blankets are superior to all machine-made ones. \r\n\r\nHer husband is very expert and knits very fine blankets. This is a very slow and time-intensive procedure, as he knits blankets over multiple nights. This is the reason her husband sells them at a high price, but the problem is the customers do not agree upon the demanded cost. The demand for fine blankets has been increasing over time.\r\n\r\nHer husband wants to buy more raw materials for knitting blankets, but he does not have enough savings to make this purchase possible.

is from the Eghegnavan village, which is in the Ararat region. She is married, with two little children (ages 1 and 4 years). Marita's husband has worked as a taxi driver for many years using his own car. \r\n\r\nFor over a year, Marita herself has been involved in the retail business. Particularly she has been selling clothing and dressmaking accessories to local people. Together with her husband, Marita goes to the city market, buys new stocks of clothing, and resells it from her home. \r\n\r\nDue to her nice attitude toward people and hard work, Marita has a lot of customers who are ordering clothing from her. Now, as the winter is almost here, people demand winter clothing. So to be able to meet the current demand of her customers, Marita would like to purchase new stocks of winter clothing. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately because of a hard financial condition for the family, Marita isn't able to purchase them.

Approximately 6 years ago, she began her own beauty salon with which she has generated income to sustain the basic needs of the household and to provide education to her children. She came to learn this trade thanks to her mother, who has a beauty salon located in a city on the Caribbean coast. Her first job she had as an independent was with hair straighteners, as an in-home service; but due to family difficulties she had to stop this work, as she didn't have anyone with whom to leave the children to care for them while she worked. For this reason she decided to start a beauty salon in her home. There she provides services and generates economic resources, while caring for her children. Today she needs a loan to invest in the purchase of fixed assets (tables, mirrors, hair dressing chairs, washing stations, etc.). In this way she will be able to improve working conditions and also be able to provide better convenience to her customers, which will increase her income from the services that increase in the Christmas season. Ana wants to continue her trade and making a business that will be prosperous and competitive, so that she can generate reliable and stable income for her family that will give her the opportunity to enjoy a better quality of life and well being at the side of those that she loves."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy fixed assets (tables, mirrors, hairdressing chairs, washing stations, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Ceret\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T02:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T02:30:08Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Carmela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119699},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123004},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126402},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129892},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133480},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137166},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140955},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144847},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148848},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152959},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157183},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161524},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165985},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170569},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175280},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180121},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185096},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190208},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195461},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200859},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206406},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212107},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217965},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223984}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.03},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.07},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T17:36:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":638014,"name":"Carlos Mario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos fue soldado profesional pero, cansado de esta labor, decidi\u00f3 pedir la baja y con algunos ahorros que ten\u00eda, decidi\u00f3 emprender su propio negocio, una litograf\u00eda que se encuentra ubicada en su lugar de residencia, all\u00ed trabaja en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposa todos los d\u00edas de 8:00 am a 6:00 pm, imprimiendo libros que saca a circulaci\u00f3n y, de esta manera genera los recursos suficientes para brindar sustento a su esposa y a su peque\u00f1o hijo de 3 a\u00f1os de edad.

is 42 years old and lives in the town of Kibuli in the region of Kampala South in Uganda. She is married and has seven children, with three of them currently in school. \r\n\r\nFor the past 15 years, Jovans has been working hard to manage her farming business:  She rears goats. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jovans has requested a loan of UGX 3,000,000 from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more goats.

Poro tiene fe en Dios, que su condici\u00f3n de vida mejorara y poder vivir de una manera con menos trabajo.\n","en":"Juan is 65 years old, and he is single. For reasons of life, he traveled to look for a better future for his wife, and since he was out of the country, they decided to separate. Since then, he lives unaccompanied, in the same house as his siblings. He works in agriculture and also as a day laborer, from which he has income for his personal expenses and to help his siblings with the household expenses, which is his main contribution, because he spends all his time working. This is all the family that he has, because he was never able to have his own family.\r\n\r\nJuan has worked in agriculture since the age of 10. He began working as a ranch hand on the ranches that existed in the past. He worked with cattle and did work in the corn fields in everything related to agriculture. His whole life has been this work, and thanks to this he has a lot of experience with corn and beans, which are the crops he produces. He was obliged to learn all this because his parents always required them to work. They did not let them go to school, as he states now. In addition to agriculture, he works as a day laborer and also in the production of corn. He works together with his other brother and the distance that they travel to arrive at the field is about 45 minutes by bicycle, which is to say that he is worn out when he arrives at the house, because he does his work all day from 6 [in the morning] until 5 in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe is applying for the loan to pay the workers who will harvest 21,000 square meters of corn, because he wants to appear with the first grains in the month of January when the price is still good. With the money, he will be able to cover the need to harvest his grain much more rapidly and easily and with less work for him and his brother.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that with the earnings from his production, he will be able to help his nephew, since he is like the son that he was never able to have. With tears in his eyes, the borrower greatly laments that he was never able to have his own family and have the support of his wife, although his siblings help him, but it's not the same. But he has faith in God that his condition in life will improve and he will be able to live in a way that requires less work.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1477595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to pay workers to harvest 21,000 square meters of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T03:30:40Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T03:30:40Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-29T09:32:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639018,"name":"Halim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halim is 29 years old, married and has children who live in Sana'a, Yemen.

He started his little shop two years ago.\r\n\r\nA typical way to sell fruits and vegetables in his area is by driving around in the neighborhood, selling his goods on the street, near the homes of his customers. Every morning the streets of neighborhoods are noisy from the horns of such moving stalls, as women shop for the daily fresh goods for that day\u2019s lunch and dinner. \r\n\r\nRasol would like to buy a small vehicle, a 3-wheeled motorcycle with a platform on the back, typical for delivering and selling vegetables so he can participate in this mode of selling and increase his sales by going into the areas where customers are ready to buy. \r\n\r\nTo be able to make the purchase he is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients, and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity.

The small, income generating activity based in her home allows her to be flexible with her household duties as well as with the orders received from her clients. A major obstacle, however, is the fact that in her area power outages are frequent and can last for many hours, with no regular patterns or predictability. This makes planning the work difficult, and also leaves her little time for the actual orders to be completed. To be able to better plan the work and deliver better quality services she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine. To be able to afford the purchases she is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. <br \/><br \/>Relief International Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

He makes it possible for residents of the Khamadoni region to rent tables, chair, plates for weddings and other events. Rustam has been working out of a small leased space for several years. Since he is a goal-oriented person by nature, he has decided to expand his business. His main goal is to own his proper store. He does not want to continue leasing space as this requires a lot of money. Rustamkhon lacks own funds in order to realize this plan, which is why he is applying for a loan. Rustamkhon would like to purchase a spacious store and use it to provide his services.

She has over 10 years of experience with making dresses for women and children and also making small fabric household items based on her customers\u2019 needs. The small, income-generating activity based in her home allows her to be flexible with the household duties, as well as with the orders received from the clients. A major obstacle, however, is the fact that in her area power outages are frequent and can last for many hours, with no regular patterns or predictability. These outages make planning the work difficult and also leave her little time for the actual orders to be completed. To be able to better plan the work and to deliver better quality services, she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine. To be able to afford the purchases, she is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq offers \u201cgroup loans\u201d for clients who are unable to provide a guarantor and, therefore, unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Mar\u00eda works alone every day and, so far, she has had good results with her business.  Mar\u00eda's tenacity, her perseverance, and her dedication have allowed her to achieve her own goals.  She is now applying for a loan as she wants to continue expanding and so wants to buy stock (dairy products, eggs, brown sugar loafs, chocolate, coffee, biscuits, meat products, and more) in bulk.  With all this she can satisfy the increased demand that comes at the end of the year and she will have an increase in sales and in her income.  It is through this loan that Mar\u00eda dreams of expanding her business and increasing her customer base so that she can guarantee more financial stability that will allow her to enjoy her old age in peace with the people she loves."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock (dairy products, eggs, brown sugar loafs, chocolate, coffee, biscuits, meat products, and more) in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"La Ceja","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Edid ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142842},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146787},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150841},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155007},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159288},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163687},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168208},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172853},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177627},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182533},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187574},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192753}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T21:57:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639935,"name":"Mohbonu","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u043e\u0445\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u042f\u0432\u0430\u043d. \u0415\u0439 23 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435. \u041c\u043e\u0445\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044c\u044e, \u043c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0448\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439. \u041c\u043e\u0445\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u0432 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0443\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0443\u044e-\u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0435. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0435\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c -

So, using the experience she had acquired working in other clothing factories, she decided to set up her own workshop, using a simple sewing machine and patterns.  However, when she wanted to make linings or do overlocking she had to hire a machine for a number of hours or wait until someone could lend her one.  Then, when she received business guidance on how to make her workshop more versatile so that she could make clothing to measure rather than by using patterns, she was motivated to seek the loan.  She would like to use it to replace her old sewing machine with an industrial flatbed one, which will enable her to streamline the production process and make her more efficient and competitive.  All this is because of her indomitable spirit and perseverance which drive her on in pursuit of her ambitions.
