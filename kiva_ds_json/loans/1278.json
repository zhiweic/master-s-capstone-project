","en":"Veris is 53 and has sold clothing and various goods for 33 years. Her aunt helped her set up the business when she was just 20 years old. Veris and her husband have three children, ages 15, 21, and 24. The income from Veris's business, together with her husband's earnings, allow the couple to meet the family's expenses. \r\n\r\nVeris sells under and outerwar, shoes, and a great variety of household items that her customers request. She sells her merchandise four days a week, for cash or on credit, and is always adapting to the market. Veris buys her inventory from the specialized companies in each product line, usually paying cash, but sometimes buying on credit. \r\n\r\nVeris's goal is to keep strengthening her business in order to increase her investment. Her major challenge is to increase her income so that her children will be able to have professional careers and opportunities to succeed. Veris's capital is currently insufficient for the larger purchases she needs to make ahead of the Christmas and New Year's holidays.

Since her certification in Iraq in 1991, she participated in further training courses both at home and in Jordan. Her passion to help others, her skills to deliver, and her recognition to the most needed assistance for the people in her area led her to open her own small limbs manufacturing business which she opened in 2009.\n\nThe war and continued violence characterized by blasts and bombings have killed many and have left \u2013 and continue to leave \u2013 even more people with severe injuries and missing body parts. By providing individuals with prosthetics, Meada is assisting adults and children to lead normal lives, participate in everyday activities, attend schools and overcome the challenges of living with physical disabilities, overcome the challenges of dealing with the trauma and remaining signs of horrific past events.\n \nOpening the business was not without challenges. Rent was high cost, and the really good quality raw materials for the artificial limbs are extremely expensive. The high costs would have left many without assistance as the final products would have not been affordable to the people most in need. Meada decided to work with less expensive raw materials from Turkey \u2013 rather than using the admittedly better quality, but far too expensive German materials.    \n\nSlowly Meada was able to establish her business and started to overcome the initial challenges. She gives much credit to her husband also who has helped greatly at home. Meada and her husband are raising 4 children, and at the age of 42, has the greatest potentials for the future of her business.  She is participating in the WLIFT program, taking a SME business loans and participating in business skills training and mentoring to give her the business skills that match her unique small enterprise.   \n\nShe has currently qualified for a $7000 SME loan which she would like to use for purchasing a new, bigger gas oven, as the one she is currently using is an electric one, making work during power cuts difficult. She would like to replace the engine in the Softening Machine used to make the artificial limps more comfortable. With the new, better quality engine the work will be completed faster, reducing the time for orders to be completed, and thereby allowing for more orders to be taken. With the remaining amount she will be able to purchase more raw materials.\n\nMeada has many goals and plans for the further expansion of the business, she would like to eventually add a training room to the prosthesis manufacturing facility, equipped with proper training aids to help people get used to their new prosthesis limbs. In the video she explains with her own words the future plans:\n\n\"Peace upon you! I\u2019m specialist Meada from Iraq. I have a Prosthesis Factory, Al-Jawadeen specialized prosthesis center for the physically disabled. I received a loan of $7,000 from Relief International to improve my business. I would like to expand it as my business needs a training hall with equipment for the men and women (for getting used to the prosthesis). We serve disabled adults and children; adults with prosthesis and children with supportive aids.

She wants to start her own business, a caf\u00e9 in a well knows sector frequented by workers from different companies located in the area.

She also has the advantage of her husband being known in the area because he has been working there for more than 12 years.  She wants to use the money to buy durable goods (ice machine, tables, chairs, kitchen utensils, and other things) and supplies in quantity (vegetables, cooking oil, disposable articles, condiments, soft drinks, and other things) so she can start her project.

She is 21 years old, single and without children. She lives with her parents. Her family depends solely on farming such as the cultivation of coffee and consequently she helps her parents with the different activities associated with the farm. She has been doing this for more than 5 years and it was her parents who taught her how to work the land. She works together with them but she also has her own plot of land that they gave to her which is located 2km from her house. They transferred it to her unkempt with the goal that she would be able to work and to understand the value of the things that they had provided to her and achieved through lots of work over the years. She has encountered some challenges with her work in the field including pests and changes in the natural climate, but competition is not a problem she faces and she is able to sell and generate an income for her family and home. Her dreams are to be able to obtain more land and a larger coffee plantation, and to offer to her clients a larger variety of products. Through this means she will be able to obtain better earnings and achieve better economic stability to reinvest in her coffee crops. Today she is seeking a loan that she will use to improve her crops by giving them better assistance through the application of agricultural products such as fertilizers, coffee formulas, and fungicides that prevent contamination by vermin and blights.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1479450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase agricultural supplies to support her coffee crops. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T16:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T16:50:12Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilcia Gricelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-30T21:34:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639212,"name":"Huda Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group called Huda consists of five members who live in Hodeida, Yemen.

","en":"Blanca is 46 years old and went to school through the fourth grade.  She grew up with her grandmother, who did not allow her to continue her studies since she thought they were a waste of time.  Blanca is married and her husband helps her with her business.  Her three children are married and no longer live at home.  Blanca lives alone with her husband.\r\n\r\nBlanca has shown herself to be a fighter, with strong desires to get ahead.  This has allowed her to become a great seller of chickens, a business that she learned approximately 34 years ago, when she left school.  Thanks to a neighbor and friend who helped her, she was able to start her own business.  Her friend traveled three days each week to one of the most important markets in the capital of the country, and she allowed Blanca, with her young age and inexperience, to accompany her so that Blanca would not get lost and nothing bad would happen to her.  So since Blanca, a country girl, liked raising chickens, the neighbor decided to sell some of those that she had, and for Blanca the business went very well.  From that time she has been working in this field.  Now she sells approximately 400 chickens per week.  Since the work is heavy, she receives help from her husband and together they maintain the business, which has allowed them to spend more time together and to improve their relationship.\r\n\r\nBlanca needs a loan in order to invest in her chicken business.  The holidays are approaching, and thus the demand increases considerably.  It is important that she take advantage of this season for sales.  With the loan she will be helped to purchase approximately 350 chickens, which she will then sell.  \r\n\r\nBlanca dreams of growing her business and thus increasing sales.

She is 45 years old and from the Jui eastern area in Freetown. She is married, with two children.  \r\n\r\nFor the past 25 years, Voliet has managed her retail business. She began her business because she wanted to sustain her family's standard of living.  She works at the business from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m., 7 days per week.

She is 29, a housewife and a farmer. She is in a common-law marriage and has three children. The eldest is going to primary school, the other two are too young to attend school.\r\nMaria Jesus learned farming thanks to her parents, whom she helped from an early age with the maintenance of the coffee crops. Her crops are located in the same community where she lives and she goes there by beast of burden. She owns the land thanks to an inheritance from her parents.\r\nIn her youth, Maria Jesus was able to complete primary education thanks to the support from her parents but could not continue studying due to lack of funding. Secondary level studies were a bit more expensive and her parents had limited resources which didn't allow them to support her studies further, but rather, only to cover basic household needs such as food, clothing, or medicines, and these with many restrictions.\r\nMaria Jesus dreams of providing a better future for her children, with better opportunities and better quality of life so that they in turn will be able to provide for all the necessities of their families. She also wants to buy land to grow more coffee, of a better variety. This is why she is asking for financing so she can improve her crops by taking better care of them through the use of farming supplies such as manure, fertilizer, coffee formula and fungicides that will prevent bug infections and illnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1479479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase farming supplies to help with her coffee crops.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T19:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T19:30:11Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-05T04:22:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639298,"name":"Aminata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Aminata, 30 years old and coming from Jui eastern area in Freetown.

","en":"Lutfidin is a 27-year-old resident of the Gissar region in Tajikistan.  He is married, and has 2 small children.  Lutfidin is currently unemployed; he's been looking for a job for quite a long time, but has yet to find one that pays as well as he'd like.  He has decided to start up his own business as a taxi driver; however, he lacks the money to buy a taxi.  As such, Lutfidin feels his only option is to take out a loan, and is requesting a loan for as much money as necessary to buy a Daewoo Tico to use as a taxi.  This loan will allow Lutfidin to not only have a job, but a source of stable income for his family as well.  Once he's a taxi driver, he plans on working a fixed route in the city of Dushanbe (in Gissar).

Previously they were four members, but two more people joined the group. For that reason they decided to choose this name for the association. They live in a community of the Mazahua people, where the largest festival happens on September 28 and 29. There is a big horse race; people go through the streets to Santo San Miguel; loud rockets are heard; and in the evening people light fireworks known as \"toritos\" [\"little bulls\"] or \"castillos\" [\"castles\"]. \r\n\r\nRosa, or Rosy as her friends call her, is a member of the communal bank. She is 43 years old and has been married for 24 years to Macario; together they have formed a family with nine children, two boys and seven girls. Five of them are still dependent. While Mr. Macario works in the countryside, Ms. Rosy operates a small notions store. For this reason she is requesting a loan from VisionFund and KIVA to buy more merchandise such as earrings, rings, and inexpensive bracelets. She also sells thread and checkered fabrics for sewing, among other things. She says that although these are very simple and small things, it is going very well for her. She comments that she started her business 15 years ago, because Rosy had a great desire to help her husband with the household expenses: \"I saw how my husband was working long hours, but we couldn't make ends meet, and we didn't have enough money to cover all of the household expenses and the education of all of our children.\"  \r\n\r\nShe started the business in her mother-in-law's house, but her sales were not as favorable as she had hoped, so she decided to move the business to her house. However, in her mother-in-law's house she left behind a nixtamal [corn] mill which is also profitable. Rosy is very happy with her business, and she says that she wants to continue working hard and not abandon it, because currently her biggest difficulty is the competition within her community. Rosy comments: \u201cMy biggest dream is to be able to improve the store, because now it is only roofed with sheet metal, and to expand it to sell other items.\" Rosy also has the desire to buy a small truck and go out to \"ranchar\" (offer her products in other communities). In this way she will be able to increase her earnings to pay for the household expenses and her children's education. The other members of the group are Gloria, who will invest her loan in chickens and embroidered items; Teresa, who will buy sheep; Martina, who will obtain some turkeys; Miriam, who will invest in pigs; and Catalina, who will buy a nixtamal mill. All of them are very grateful to VisionFund and KIVA for the loan, because it will help them in various ways with their economic activities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy beads, earrings, necklaces, rings, checkered fabric, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel Agua Bendita, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-02T22:57:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639270,"name":"Martha Azucena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha Azucena de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera con tres hijos, es originaria de Leon, lugar que est\u00e1 ubicado en la zona de occidente del pa\u00eds, se caracteriza por ser trabajadora, responsable, con ganas de superaci\u00f3n personal.

Thanks to the water loan program offered by HKL with a special interest rate, he is encouraged to focus on healthy living conditions, safeguard the health of his family, and protect the environment.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":69.45,"image":{"id":1480984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to build a household latrine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Prey Veng","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T01:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T01:10:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138900},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":277800,"processed_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":278356.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439743066,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T11:54:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639278,"name":"Zarzamora Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cZarzamora\u201d est\u00e1 integrado por  cuatro integrantes tres mujeres y un hombre todos ellos pertenecen a una comunidad mazahua en la cual a\u00fan conservan su lengua materna que es el mazahua, sus trajes t\u00edpicos, sus fiestas y costumbres, Las personas de la comunidad son muy amables siempre pero sobretodo muy trabajadores la mayor\u00eda de ellos se dedican al cultivo de ma\u00edz.

The majority of them earn a living by growing corn. \r\n\r\nJuan, who is the group's representative, says that they chose the name \"Zarzamora\" for the group due to the fact that the area where he lived and spent his childhood has a lot of Zarzamora, a fruit typical to this region.

They have a family of five children, of whom four as still in school. Juan earns a living by fattening and selling sheep. He has been doing this for 8 years, and he says that his sheep reproduce quickly, and they sell fast. He buys them when they are small in order to raise and fatten them, typically for a period of 6 months. He sells them to people who sell the barbecued meat. He hasn't encountered any difficulties. He works during the year to grow corn and oats to ensure that his sheep have food. If they get sick, he takes them immediately to the vet for treatment.\r\n\r\nJuan says, \"I like this job very much since while I work and earn a living, my wife takes care of the sheep so that when they are fully grown, we can sell them and earn more income to improve our family's quality of life.\" \r\n\r\nJuan, Mar\u00eda Julia, Hilaria, and Rosalinda are very happy and grateful to VisionFund and KIVA, as due to the loan then can buy more sheep."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel La Labor, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":3150,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":41000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6081.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6313.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6620.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7046.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7285.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7652.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":467.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":485.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":508.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":559.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-04T14:15:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639581,"name":"Luciano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luciano operates a fishing business, selling seafood products including crabs and shrimp in the local community to earn a living.

En ese momento no sab\u00eda bordar pero aprendi\u00f3 de unos familiares que tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a la elaboraci\u00f3n de artesan\u00eda toan solo con verlos. Cuando ya ten\u00eda varias piezas a esa misma edad inicio a salir a las ciudades grandes para vender su artesan\u00eda y con sus primeras ganancias le repuso el su\u00e9ter a su mam\u00e1.

She and her husband, Rosendo, have been married for 25 years and have three grown children.  Rosendo has his own taxi business and Do\u00f1a Esperanza has operated a knitwear products business for 38 years.  She makes hats, scarves, gloves, etc. and tells us that she decided at 7 years old to learn to knit even though she had no materials to practice with.  \"One day, I took a sweater and a pair of scissors, found a place to hide and cut up the sweater--my mother's!--to make the yarn I needed.\"  Do\u00f1a Esperanza was happy with the result, but her mother less so because it was a favorite sweater.  \"My mother scolded me for ruining the sweater, then bought balls of yarn in different colors so that I could start knitting in earnest.\"  She learned by watching relatives who had businesses similar to the one that she has now and when she had pieces good enough to sell, she sold them in the market.  And she used the money that she made from her first sales to buy her mother a new sweater.  She has earned a living from making and selling knitted products ever since.  She works year-round, but knitwear is most in demand during the winter when it's coldest.  Local prices for her products are low so, for the last 6 years, she has sold what she makes in other parts where buyers pay more.  Do\u00f1a Esperanza is applying to VisionFund and Kiva for a loan that she will use to buy yarn and the other supplies that she needs to continue her knitwear business.  She designs all of her creations and only needs a few minutes to make them, but her materials are expensive and she needs help to buy them.  The loan will be a great help to her, she says: \"It makes me happy to know that I can carry the business forward . . . I enjoy it very much and think that I have a gift for making the products that I make\".  For the future, she wants to finish renovating space for shops at her house that she can loan to her nieces for businesses that they can operate together. She would also like to set up an animal-sales business that would generate an extra income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to stock her knitwear business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Jalpa de los Ba\u00f1os, Ixtlahuaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":947.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":971.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1021.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1134.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1132.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1207.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1253.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1330.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1387.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1459.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1539.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1613.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.47},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-02T00:51:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639301,"name":"Yrma Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yrma Rosa tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposo y su hijos en el distrito de Oyotun, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda a dos horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nElla se dedica a la crianza y comercializaci\u00f3n de animales  menores patos, cerdos, gallinas, pavos y cuyes en la parte posterior a su domicilio, es conocida en la zona, lo distribuye por los caserios aleda\u00f1os a su comunidad.\n<p>\nHa solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 2 000 nuevos soles para construir una granja de cerdos en un terreno cerca a su domicilio y as\u00ed ofrecer su producci\u00f3n a sus clientes, generando mayores ingresos para su familia.\n\n","en":"Yrma Rosa is 45 years old.

Her first job was in a cake shop. But later, thinking she would be more \u201cpractical\u201d, she went to college and ended up at a desk job where she remained for several years. She didn\u2019t like it! And she never stopped thinking about her love of cooking and baking. So she finally decided to make a career out of her passion.\r\n\r\nSince the start of her business in 2013, Jenny has offered specialty cakes and fresh-baked goods out of her in-home business, \"Jenny Jane\u2019s Bakery\". As the sole employee, Jenny noticed a need to increase her customer base by moving the business out of her home and into a facility. Before her loan, Jenny restricted her business to only people she knew to ensure her safety. She now leases a large building on a major street in San Antonio and is expecting her business to grow. The building also allows for a potential restaurant or party venue.\r\n\r\nBefore completing the transition, Jenny searched online for small business lenders and learned about Accion Texas Inc. The nonprofit microlender helped her meet the demand of customers by giving her the ability to purchase a commercial fridge, baking supplies and equipment and allowed her to market her business. Jenny predicts the loan will not only increase the amount of business but also permit her to create jobs in her community. As the bakery grows, she plans to hire at least one part-time employee.\r\n.\r\nCurrently, Jenny is completing her website which will have consultation sheets, operation times, information on some of the different menu items, flavors, prices, samples, FAQs, and more. Look for it by mid-December 2013 at www.jennyjanesbakery.com"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":234.83,"image":{"id":1480705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a commercial fridge, baking supplies and equipment and market her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Antonio, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4360,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":116.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":117.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":121.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":123.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":126.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":128.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":130.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":132.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":134.79},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":136.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":138.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":140.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":143.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":145.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":147.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":149.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":151.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":154.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":156.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":158.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":161.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":168.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":171.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":173.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":176.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":179.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.63},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.21},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":234.83,"local_amount":234.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-22T09:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":234.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439625536,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T19:39:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639599,"name":"Bushra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bushra is a 31-year-old married lady and the mother of five children.

As her education is being subsidized by her parents, she aims to have a part-time job to help her parents share the costs of living and pay for her university fees. Kanharath is very happy and grateful for the loans funded via programs like Kiva that enable poor students to pursue a higher education, and contribute to the future development of Cambodia."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1471839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":" to pay for her university tuition fees.

The most prominent feast is when Santa Ana is celebrated. Jacinto is 32 years old. He's married to Fabiola, and together they have made a family with two children. Jacinto has owned a taxi for the past five years. He started this business because there were no other people providing these services. At first he didn't have all his papers in order but thanks to his first loan with VisionFund, he was able to legalize his business with the authorities. Jacinto is very glad to see his dream come true, because now he can drive freely around his community and his town. However, his biggest difficulty is the competition, since several new taxi stands have been opening in the past few months. This time Jacinto requested a loan in order to use it to purchase spare parts for his taxi. However, he'll also use part of it to purchase candles and flowers to celebrate the Day of the Dead - \"I'm sure that I'll do very well selling these items during this season\". Jacinto's only dream is to be able to maintain his taxi and make good profits. That way he'll continue to improve his family's living conditions and somehow ensure his children's education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase auto parts, as well as flowers and candles for the Day of the Dead.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Ana Nichi, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T02:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T02:30:05Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacinto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1097.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1123.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1149.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1176.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1203.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1231.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1260.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1289.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1320.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1350.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1382.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-08T20:08:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639509,"name":"Hazel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hazel is 20 years old and lives with her family.

Alma lives in a quiet rural town in a traditional Mazahua area where local people have held on to their language and traditions.  Alma is a friendly, good-natured woman, but serious about the craft products that she makes: \"I learned to make these when I was just a girl . . . my mother made silver earrings, necklaces, rings, key chains and other silver craft products and I learned at her knee\".  Alma started with just an ounce of silver and slowly built her business by using her earnings from the products she made to buy more silver and make more elaborate products.  Alma says that she and her husband make a living making and selling her products and that she values the chance to teach others about Mazahuan culture.  She has been buying tools for making her products for six years and says: \"Making earrings takes us about two days, the first to smelt and shape the silver and the second to solder the loose pieces together to create the final design\".  Alma's work is well-known at the shops, fairs and craft markets where she sells her products.  Her immediate obstacle is a lack of money to buy the tools she needs to set up a workshop where she could train others to become artisans.  Her dream, though, is to open a shop where she would sell her own exclusive pieces."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy supplies for her crafts business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Localidad Plateros, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alma Rosy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1381.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1813.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1855.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1899.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1988.81},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2035.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2082.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-30T12:59:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639288,"name":"Elfer Bilardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elfer tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a esposa en el distrito de Pucar\u00e1, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica al cultivo de frutales, comercio de los mismos y ganader\u00eda a dos horas de la ciudad de Ja\u00e9n, sierra norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nEl brinda servicio de trasporte p\u00fablico de pasajeros en su propia mototaxi, trasladando a sus clientes por las zonas aleda\u00f1as a su comunidad,  ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 1 000 nuevos soles para darle mantenimiento a su veh\u00edculo y de esta manera seguir trabajando con seguridad, generando ingresos para su familia.\n","en":"Elfer, 28, and his wife live in Pucar\u00e1, about two hours from Jaen, a city in the mountains of northern Per\u00fa.

Con mucho esfuerzo ella ha salido adelante ya que su pareja hace 6 meses tuvo un accidente automovil\u00edstico en el cual quedo invalido.

She has a technical degree in computer technology but decided to help her parents with their coffee crops, and began to work on that. She's in a common law marriage and from this relationship with her live-in partner she has a 2-year-old son. She has been getting ahead with a great deal of effort, since six months ago her partner was in a car accident that left him disabled. A few months ago he had surgery on his spine but the results weren't positive. She has been working on the coffee crops alone ever since. This has been very difficult, because she has to do all the work. Occasionally, her siblings help her out, but it's not permanent - only when the work gets piled up. Her parents taught her to grow coffee. She acquired the knowledge she needed to work and get an income for herself and her family, and she has made the most of it. She owns a total of 4.5 manzanas, of which 2.5 are in production and 2 are being sowed (1 manzana equals about 1.740 acres). Part of the land she inherited from her parents and part of it they purchased by making an effort, and it's located 25 minutes away from where she lives. She gets around in a vehicle and picks up the people who help her reap the coffee, then in the afternoon she drops them off again at the meeting point. One of the challenges she faces is that people may take advantage of her because she's a woman, and that the middleman may not buy her coffee at fair prices. That's the reason why she requests a loan from COMIXMUL in order to purchase farm supplies with which she'll maintain her coffee crops. That way she'll have an excellent harvest and she'll be able to increase her profits for the sake of her family's well-being.\r\nErika's goal is to improve her earnings so that she can get herself and her family ahead, and therefore be able to buy more land in order to keep on growing more crops. She also aims to be able to help her husband get a second operation so that he can walk again. As a mother, she aims to leave her son a legacy and ensure his future so that he can become a professional and a decent person."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase farm supplies so she can maintain her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T02:50:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Rachel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-30T16:38:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639312,"name":"Luis Roberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis  es un hombre casado de 50 a\u00f1os de edad,  padre de ocho hijos  de los cuales 4 ya est\u00e1n casados y los otros cuatro aun viven con sus padres, dos de ellos est\u00e1n estudiando y las otras dos ayudan a su madre en los oficios de su hogar.\nEl es un hombre trabajador que lucha por el bienestar de su familia.

She is married with one child.  In 2005, Jeneba established her retail business. She began her business because she wanted to generate a permanent source of income.  She works at the business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, seven days per week.
