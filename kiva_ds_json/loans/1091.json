She learned to cultivate the land, and she has a lot of knowledge of agricultural subjects, but as she commented, she settled in the town and stopped planting continually. \"I plant food for my use. In this way I feed myself in a natural manner,\" she states. But she began a business of buying and selling animals such as cows, pigs, and sheep, which she fattens to sell later. \"I not only fatten them, I also nourish them with good grass and balanced feed so that they have good meat and sell for more.\" It is for this reason that she plants alfalfa on her largest areas of agricultural land, where she produces natural pasturelands for the consumption of her animals.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva, and she promises to be punctual in making her payments.

She lives with her husband in the house which she inherited from her parents.

She used to like sowing crops, which she says that she still does, but only for her own consumption. It is during the corn season that she has a good income selling her own harvest.\r\n\r\nThere are currently many people who make a living just by being farmers, but she does not want to be one of them. Therefore, she learned the business of selling legumes and corn, which gives her a stable income. She would now like to buy a place in a commercial area so she can sell her legumes at a good price and grow into a wholesale entrepreneur. \"That is my goal, which I hope to accomplish with the support of my husband and my family, especially because my children are young and they will need us,\" she says.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva.

Their designs are much in demand and they have enough customers that they are able to manage their household expenses. Her daughter also assists them in completing orders on time. To help her to continue her operations, she requested a loan of 30,000 PKR to buy threads in different colors and packs of beads, sequins, and stones for embellishing her designs. In this way she will be able to cater to more customers consistently. She is hopeful to increase her income by targeting more customers. She is in her fifth loan cycle, has good repayment history, and is very thankful to Kashf for its tremendous support. Kishwar dreams for her children's bright future and desires to build her own house, as she is living in a rented house with her family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":232.95,"image":{"id":1325072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy threads and packs of beads, sequins, and stones","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Faisalabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.416667 73.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-04-04T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-04T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kishwar  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2123},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2185},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2249},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2315},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2383},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2452},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2524},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2598},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2674},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2752},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2832},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2913}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":2123,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2264.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364557497,"comment":null},{"amount":23.67,"local_amount":2185,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2330.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372955992,"comment":null},{"amount":24.36,"local_amount":2249,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2398.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381736426,"comment":null},{"amount":25.08,"local_amount":2315,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2469.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390822878,"comment":null},{"amount":25.82,"local_amount":2383,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2541.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399843187,"comment":null},{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":2452,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410118012,"comment":null},{"amount":27.35,"local_amount":2524,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2692.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419883265,"comment":null},{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":2598,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2771.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429531870,"comment":null},{"amount":28.97,"local_amount":2674,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2852.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439755690,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-05T11:47:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544480,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora, age 45, has operated a sari-sari (variety store) business for more than nine years now.

She must buy goods for widening the assortment of her goods, but she doesn't have money for it. She is asking for a loan of 2,000 Somoni to buy goods for widening the assortment of goods. She awaits your mercy.

","en":"Mirsaid always wanted to be a wealthy businessman, as he is educated to be a mathematics teacher and teaches at high school. Mirsaid is a married man and he has raised four children. The children are adults. His wife works as a nurse at a rural hospital. She is a very good woman and tries to help her husband in all cases. \r\n\r\nSo, 16 years ago, Mirsaid started his business of livestock breeding and agriculture and very successfully runs his business.

She had a great childhood with her mother and her father. She remembers that they spent a lot of time with their family.  They used to do family activities on the weekends.  At the age of 7, her younger brother was born. He was her playmate with toys, pranks, and offices of the house. Although she admits they have their differences and sometimes fight, they have a good relationship. Of course it is natural that they have distinct personalities and characteristics. In regards to their parents, they have been separated for 12 years.  Since then she has only lived with her mother and her brother. Until now, her mother was responsible for all the household expenses. For this reason she feels that it is important to emphasize that she has had a lot of influence on her method of thinking and interpretation of the world.  Her mother taught that to reach her objectives she needs to work hard for them and she needs to have a lot of responsibility, commitment, love and especially strength. She should not be discouraged when there are difficulties even if they are very challenging because they might not be as hard to achieve them if they are worth pursing.  On the other hand since her father has difficultly contributing to their financial income, he has always been worried about the well being of the family.  Her father is loving and understanding. He has always impressing on them the importance on studying and to get trained in their area of interest and passion.  So they can worth with love and dedication, he always says \u201cstudying is the only commodity that no one can take away.\u201d This is something that has always contributed to Paoloa\u2019s academic pursuit. \r\n\r\nShe has completed her elementary and junior high school studies in the \u201cColegio Campestre Maximino Poitiers\u201d (Rural School Maximino Poitiers). There she met nice people that are not valuable friends. From these friendships she has also learned many positive qualities such as being a happy, non-pretentious, and cooperating person.  For her every person that she is allowed to meet in depth is a learning gift. \r\n\r\nThe school stage was one of the best experiences that she has had, but this ended on November 30, 2011.  After she graduated she was certain that she wanted to go to the University of Distrital Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas. Fortunately, she was admitted. Soon the time came for her to start school where she studied Humanities and Castillian language. She enthusiastically started her studies, but unfortunately as time passed by she realized she did not feel satisfied with the subject she was studying. Even though she didn\u2019t feel connected with her studies, she knew that her only responsibility was to continue studying even though she did not like her career. She still gave the best of herself. When she finished the first semester she had good grades. Her grades were so good that she received tuition remission for the second semester, but she was meditating and questioning if this was her true passion. She was looking ahead for a few years and she did not consider herself working in this profession. After giving it serious consideration, she decided to speak with her parents to let them know that she was not satisfied with her chosen profession and she thought it was prudent to switch majors. At the beginning her parents opposed her decision, which made her doubt, but firmly and with a lot of respect she told them. \u201cIf you want me to continue in this major simply because you like it, wouldn\u2019t you think it is unfair and that when I work on my career I would do it with frustration?\u201d  Thank God they let their guard down and supported her decision. At that point she questioned what she would really like to study and where could she study. Then she decided to study cooking in Campoalto for that year to study in Campoalto in August. \r\n\r\nShe is taking her second semester and as a side activity she does in home manicures, she sells cleaning supplies, she builds key chains for a company that is promoting their product, she takes her cousin to kindergarten, in these ways she obtains the financial sources to do her culinary work and have money for her tuition. Sometimes she can not afford all of her expenses and occasionally her parents help her financially. \r\n\r\nShe wants to finish her studies and begin working. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to finish her culinary academic program in Campoalto","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197689,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891011,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912425,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-05T01:46:15Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544676,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is a 60-year-old woman who runs a store to support her family.

However, because of her family circumstances, she did not have the opportunity to go to university, so she has no higher education.\r\n\r\nAfter getting married, Dilorom started to experience financial problems.  Her husband is a simple worker and his small income is not enough to provide for two children.  She therefore wants to start her own business so that she can find an additional source of income for her family.  She was very excited to learn about the course entitled \"Achieving Successs\", organized by the Association of Business Women.  She took part in this course and learned a lot of new information related to starting a new business.\r\n\r\nDilorom now wants to start buying and selling food products, since this type of goods is in high demand.  She lives in a rural setting where the competition is low.  Her mother-in-law will also be helping her with the business.\r\n\r\nDilorom is requesting a loan of $2,000 for the purchase of food products.

She lives in her own home along with her husband, who makes a living selling fresh pork and its derivatives, and their children, who are in elementary school. Eyra Elizabeth is a member of Las Flores loan group, and she makes a living making and selling corn tortillas. She makes between 200 and 250 tortillas a day and sells them herself out of her home to a regular customer base consisting of her neighbors. She works from 6 a.m. until 10 a.m. every day, since tortillas are eaten on a daily basis. This is the main source of income for her family, and she assumes part of the household expenses, such as her children's education. She has dedicated herself to the tortilla business for 12 years, and she also makes other traditional foods like tamales, which she only makes on the weekends and are in high demand because of their great taste. A young member of this group is Elizabeth Del Socorro, who also makes and sells corn tortillas out of her home.

","en":"Ozodjon lives in a village located not far from an urban center.  He works in his village, repairing passenger cars.  He does not have any specialized education, but learned his trade from an instructor who happened to be a neighbor.  Ozodjon has always had an interest in cars: in the beginning, he just helped his neighbor, but then he was drawn into the business.  He has been working with his neighbor\/instructor for many years.   The two of them rented a commercial space to fix passenger cars.\r\n\r\nOzodjon already has his own apprentices and he is happy to teach them his trade.  In the future, he is planning to open his own shop, where he would provide all car repair services.\r\n\r\nOzodjon is married and has a family.  His wife is not employed, she takes care of the children.\r\n\r\nOzodjon's friends advised him to take a loan with the microfinance institution Arvand, in order to buy auto spare parts.  Ozodjon plans to use his loan to buy everything that he needs for his work.  He is very glad that institutions such as MDO Arvand are here to help people during difficult times.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1312836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy auto spare parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T04:40:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ozodjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":171.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":177.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":183.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":189.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":195.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":202.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":209.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":216.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":223.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":231.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.41,"local_amount":171.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:17Z","rounded_local_amount":173.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572695,"comment":null},{"amount":37.65,"local_amount":177.16,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":179.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971466,"comment":null},{"amount":38.92,"local_amount":183.16,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":185.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751985,"comment":null},{"amount":312.02,"local_amount":1468.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1483.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616069,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T11:15:46Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:30:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544677,"name":"Analyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 35-year-old woman, Analyn is diligent and loving.

She has always wanted to succeed and to be someone in her life, so she started to work at the age of 15 in a family home, where they knew her mother and gave her the opportunity to work from 3pm to 7pm. She really stood out and they recommended her to their relatives, who also offered her work in the mornings. They were very good people, and thanks to them she was able to save up for a year and a half so that she could take on a technical degree.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, she decided to change jobs because she started studying and she could no longer comply with her work schedule, so she sold chorizo in butcher's shops and restaurants.

He lives in a small village in the Marneuli District with his wife, two sons and a daughter-in-law. Khudaverdi requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business startup, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have 0.3 hectares of agricultural land where potatoes are grown. They sell the harvested potatoes at local markets. Kudaverdi\u2019s son, Akhmed, has rented a workshop and works as an artisan of cars. It is hardly enough to pay for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKhudaverdi requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program seeks to provide business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, George will purchase a digital camera. He will go on the weddings as an photographer, take pictures and edit them. George is very talented in taking pictures and people in his district know about it, so he will have many clients. As he will not have many expenses, George will make a good profit from this business.

She's married and the mother of three children, and lives with her husband and their children in a large extended traditional family in Bougoula in the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nAfter running a lot of unsuccessful businesses, she started buying and selling pagnes (colorful African cloth) and frankincense approximately seven years ago.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, eager to better meet an ever-increasing customer demand, she decided to join Kiva's partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n\r\nAfter a solidarity loan (group loan) with a women's association in her neighborhood, she's now seeking her fourth personal loan. Previous loans were repaid without problems.\r\n\r\nThis fourth loan will enable her to buy 15 bales of pagnes and 20 boxes of frankincense in Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and in Sikasso. She will resell these products as a traveling saleswoman, to a clientele comprising mostly women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she foresees turning an average monthly profit of XOF 60'000 (ca US$ 120), to be used to bolster her working capital, help cover  expenses of her family, and repay the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":360,"image":{"id":1327158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy 15 bales of pagnes (colorful African cloth) and 20 boxes of frankincense","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T15:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T15:00:06Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Afouchata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20303.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636609,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":20303.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030119,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":20303.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819611,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":20303.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678502,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":20303.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924142,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":20303.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207356,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20303.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972005,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20303.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624678,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":20303.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850714,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-06T12:43:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544759,"name":"Tina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tina is 66 years old and comes from Kutaisi District.

is 38 years old. He lives in Chokhatauri district with his 32 year-old wife, his retired parents, and two children who are going to school.  Besik requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nBesik has a mini-bus. He works on the village bus line and transports local people. His monthly income is very small and not enough to feed the family.\r\nBesik requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan programs envisage the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor.  These people do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Besik wants to open a car service center. He will purchase all the needed equipment and will do the work himself, as he is very experienced in this field. He is also well known among his villagers and will have a good number of clients. This will give him a good profit. He will reinvest part of the profit to develop his business, and another part will be used for covering family monthly expenses. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He is twenty years old and comes from a humble, rural family. His story was written alongside his mom and his grandma; he never knew a dad, but his grandfather was always there supporting him. He is the oldest of six siblings. His mother worked very hard to give him an education. He always had dreams when he was little; like any boy who is beginning to dream of being a grown-up and accomplishing things, that's how he was. As he continued to grow, he still held on to his dreams. After a while, he started looking for a job; one day he was going to do an interview when something unexpected happened and he was taken in to the army. In the beginning it was hard on him because there was still that part of him that needed his mom, but he stuck with it anyway. Even now that he is not with her, he feels like he needs to keep striving for her sake, to provide for her\u2014not only materially, but also to give her the joy of a mother whose son is getting ahead\u2014and to always give her his support. Even though he is far away from that warmth, he has never felt like he was out in the cold; it just gives him more reason to keep fighting and thinking of his future.\r\n\r\nIt was approximately three years ago that he arrived in the city, his dreams still intact; actually he no longer saw them as dreams, but rather as a goal that he had to work hard to achieve: to be a great chef. And right then, he set out on what is his life plan. Never limiting himself to just one thing, he also studies many other things, like being a DJ. He has liked music since he was little, and that way, he can have his own restaurant and bar.\r\n\r\nSo he started working to pay for his own education since he didn't have any financial help from his family; he does want to help them, and to thank his grandma and his mom for all the love they gave him, for all that they taught him: in order to live, you need to dream, and in order to dream, you need to have a clear vision. And that's what he wants, to be great (it might not be much to some people, but in his life, it would be great): to be a professional, and for his life's plan not to remain wishful thinking, but rather for his effort to pay off a little more every day. A boy's dreams should never end, in spite of setbacks, because the most beautiful thing in life is to finally reach one's biggest goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to complete his culinary education program at CampoAlto.

is 37 years old. He lives in Ikalto village,Telavi district, with his 37 year-old wife, Natia, and retired parents. Archil requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nThe family has a vineyard and a small plot of agricultural land. They grow grapes and different kinds of vegetables. Harvested products are sold locally at the markets. Archil also has a car. He is working on private orders and transports different kinds of cargo to bring additional income to the family.\r\nArchil requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor.  These people do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Archil will purchase two damaged cars. He will dismantle them for parts and will start selling them separately. As car parts are highly requested in his area, Archil will make a good profit from his new business. Increased income will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1270,"image":{"id":1325820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase two damaged cars and sell the parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ikalto","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T15:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T15:30:07Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Archil ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":240}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969117,"comment":null},{"amount":160,"local_amount":160,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749536,"comment":null},{"amount":160,"local_amount":160,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613443,"comment":null},{"amount":160,"local_amount":160,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857160,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133813,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107403,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254959,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019116,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T14:21:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544775,"name":"Rosie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosie works hard to support her family.

This loan is his first sequence in the institution.  Abraham will use this loan to buy a dairy cow; he wants to take advantage of this opportunity.  The reason for requesting the loan is that he lacks the money for said purchase that will be very beneficial because good quality milk will be produced so he can make more cheese and milk to improve his income.

is 26 years old. She lives in the Akhaltsikhe district with her 29-year-old husband, mother in-law and two children who are 10 years and 6 months old respectively. Nino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, without any success. Her loan request was rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\nNino sells perfumes. She is buying products at wholesale prices from the capital city, bringing it to her village and selling it among the locals at an increased price. Her husband is an artisan. He works on private orders and gets a small monthly salary. The total family income is not enough to cover their monthly expenses.\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

compa\u00f1erita, ten\u00eda muchos amiguitos y le gustaba mucho la ensalada de repollo con zanahoria y pi\u00f1a, se acuerdo mucho q le dec\u00eda a su  mama q la llevara al jard\u00edn por q le gustaba la ensalada de zanahoria.\nLuego en la escuela, la verdad no ha sido muy buena para el estudio, pero le gustaba mucho todo lo que ten\u00eda que ver con los deportes y el baile, jugaba baloncesto y con el tiempo aprendi\u00f3 a jugar voleibol, algunas veces jugaban con los compa\u00f1eritos futbol.\nEn danzas se destaco bastante puesto que le gustaba estar bailando a toda hora y aparte de todo en los descansos colocaban grabadora con buena m\u00fasica para cantar y bailar un rato.\nEn cuanto a los compa\u00f1eros: siempre hay un ni\u00f1o bonito o el simp\u00e1tico, una ni\u00f1a q es la fe\u00edta, la charlatana, el consentido, la ni\u00f1a bonita y los dem\u00e1s. Ella era de los charlatanes, no la rega\u00f1aban todo el tiempo pero si de vez en cuando le daban quejas a la mami que  charlaba mucho en clase pero las notas bien.\nEn el bachillerato la verdad no le fue muy bien, c\u00f3mo era la consentida de papa, pues se podr\u00e1n imaginar pasar de una escuelita a un colegio fue tenaz para ella, le dio muy duro, lloraba bastante y se la montaron por llorona. Perdi\u00f3 octavo y la sacaron del colegio en donde estaba, la llevaron a otro y ese era femenino pues all\u00e1 la cosa no era muy diferente por que igual lloro cuando la dejaron sola en ese sitio.\nBueno,  en las practicas  que ten\u00edan que hacer un grupo de compa\u00f1eras y ella dictaron un cursos de danzas a los alumnos de un colegio, al principio fue algo complicado porque les toco desde los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os, hasta los m\u00e1s grandes, se acuerda mucho que le ense\u00f1aron a bailar el mapale, un baile llamado las vueltas, joropo, sanjuanero , cumbia y no otros que no recuerda, ha aparte de eso estuvo en  una velada cultural y ellas bailaron el jarabe tapat\u00edo con unas faldas hermosas que las hac\u00edan lucir divinas.\nLuego termino 11 y la se dedico a trabajar y nada m\u00e1s.\nHasta este a\u00f1o que tomo la decisi\u00f3n de retomar los estudios y como le gusta  la cocina, considera q lo hace bien y le gustar\u00eda aprender m\u00e1s de las personas q saben c\u00f3mo los maestros. \nAunque su papa no est\u00e1 vivo sabe que le hubiera gustado verla en este momento, haciendo lo que le gusta y lo que a \u00e9l le gustaba. Gracias a su mama y hermanos q la apoyan en este proceso espera llegar a montar su casa de banquetes o un buen restaurante \nGracias a ustedes \n","en":"The story begins with her entering Kindergarten although she doesn\u2019t remember exactly how old she was then but she was always a very good fellow student; she had lots of friends and liked cabbage, carrot and pineapple salad very much.  She remembers asking her mother to take her to kindergarten because of how much she liked the carrot salad.\r\n\r\nLater in school the truth is that she wasn\u2019t very good at studying but liked everything to do with dancing and sports; she played basketball and in time learned how to play volleyball; sometimes she even played soccer with her male classmates.\r\n\r\nShe stood out quite a bit in dance because she liked to dance at all times and besides that during recess they\u2019d set up a tape player with good music to sing and dance for a while.\r\n\r\nAs for her little classmates, there\u2019s always the cute or pleasant little boy, or the little girl that\u2019s not too good-looking, the talkative one, the teacher\u2019s pet, the pretty girl and all the others.  She was one of the chatty ones.  They didn\u2019t always scold her for this but sometimes did send reprimands home to her mother because she chatted too much during class; her grades were good however.\r\n\r\nIn secondary school she didn\u2019t do too well but she was her father\u2019s favorite.   You can well imagine that going from a little elementary school to a secondary school was quite a shock for her; it hit her hard.  She cried quite a bit and they punished her for being a crybaby.  She failed 8th grade and they took her out of the school she was attending and transferred her to another one.  Even though that one was all girls that didn\u2019t change things for her because she cried there too when she was left alone there.\r\n\r\nSo, for the practical courses they had to do, she and a group of fellow students taught dance classes to students in a school.  At first it was a bit complicated because they got from the smallest to the biggest ones and she remembers that they taught them to dance the \u2018mapale,\u2019 and dances called \u2018las vueltas,\u2019 \u2018joropo,\u2019 \u2018sanjuanero,\u2019 \u2018cumbia,\u2019 and others she does not remember.  In addition to that she participated in a cultural evening where she danced the \u2018jarabe tapat\u00edo\u2019 wearing beautiful skirts that made her feel fabulous.  \r\n\r\nWhen she completed 11th grade she decided to go to work and that was all until she decided this year to return to school and since she likes to cook she thinks she\u2019ll do it well and would like to learn more from people, like the teachers, who know more.\r\n\r\nAlthough her father is no longer living she knows that he would have liked to see her at this moment doing what she likes and what he enjoyed too.  Thanks to her mother and siblings who support her in this process she hopes to reach her goal of establishing a banquet hall or a good restaurant thanks to you.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to complete her chef's course.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joanna Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197701,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-07T10:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891023,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912435,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-05T18:02:56Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544819,"name":"Tete","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tete is 51 years old.

problems and obstacles that exist in society, between families, and in global thinking. If this can't be achieved, one person may contribute so that someone else will achieve it for him by compiling and putting into practice each of the principles and values that life points out to him. \r\n\r\nAnderson's first goal is to become part of a government body so that he can see and understand what justice is.

is 40 years old. He is married and has three children. \r\n\r\nRavshan is a person who always falls in a story. Twenty years ago, he went to his friend\u2019s house and saw a big cow which nearly knocked him over with his horns. Ravshan was frightened and overwhelmed. Returning to his home, he decided to get money through the animal that scared him. In this way, he began his own business with animal husbandry. Now, he is one of the best and most successful businessmen in the local market. He buys cows, cares for them for two or three months, and sells them to local people. Thanks to his efforts, his cows are fat and attract a lot of customers. \r\n\r\nRavshan wants to buy more cows to develop his business, but he does not have enough money for it.

So, Sargis started to work as a laborer in one of the factories in Yerevan, in order to sustain his newly-created family.\r\n\r\nAfter the Soviet Union collapsed, that factory closed. Sargis started to work as a driver. But about 10 years ago, Sargis and his sons launched their own business, in a rented place. They sell flowers and bouquets in the store. This business was profitable, and soon they increased sales volume. This activity enables them to provide for their family's needs. With their business profit they bought a new flower shop. Sargis is very pleased by his activity. As he confessed, to work with flowers and other plants is a great pleasure for him, and he combines business with pleasure.\r\n\r\nRecently, Sargis decided to begin fruit and vegetable trading, outside of his flower shop. It will be a seasonal business, but at the same time, profitable. So Sargis needs a 600,000 Armenian Drams loan, which he will use to buy potatoes, apples, cucumbers, tomatoes and pears, for his newly-created food trading.

He lives in his mother-in-law's house, in a small room with adobe walls and a dirt floor.  The house if located in Concepcion, which is in the southern part of the city of La Paz.  Currently, Carlos works (in transportation) more than 10 hours a day, often late into the night.  He works these hours because he has to cover the cost of food and the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe needs this loan to pay for the cost of maintaining his vehicle, since it is the only source of income to sustain his family.  Carlos' dream is to improve his income so he can obtain housing via anticretico.  Anticretico is a legal term signifying that the tenant gives a sum of money to the owner in advance to be able to live in the house for no more than two years.  In the end, the money lent for the sections of the house or rooms on anticretico is returned to the tenant, who then leaves the property.

But the income they get for growing such crops as cucumbers and garlic, and for raising livestock is too little for this. He has to replace the windows and doors, which don't insulate the house during winter -- and winter in Tadzikistan is quite cold.

He lives in the city of Rustavi with his wife and two children, who are going to school. Nugzar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is Nugzar\u2019s monthly salary. He has a truck and works on transporting different kinds of cargo on private orders.\r\n\r\nNugzar requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Nugzar will purchase cement for his workshop making cement blocks for construction, which is not functional at the moment.

Thanks to God, she never lacked food, and she always had good communication with her family.  Her mother was her best friend, although she was not able to spend a lot of time with her.\r\n\r\nHer father visited them when he could, and always took care to be a great father and to help his daughters and his wife.\r\n\r\nWhen Ingrit was in 6th grade, her father died of a heart attack.  This was a blow to all of them.  From this point on, things became more difficult.  Her mother had to take charge of all of the household expenses.\r\n\r\nSometime later, the family was able to buy a nice house.  This helped them a lot, because the expenses decreased.  In 10th grade, Ingrit took the opportunity to get a technical degree from SENA (a public vocational education program).  In this program, she developed skills in working with machines to make coats and jackets.  She successfully completed this program along with her high school degree.\r\n\r\nWhen Ingrit left school, she had  no means to further her education, so she enrolled in a SENA program to learn how to make underwear.  She finished this program and also successfully completed an internship.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of her training, Ingrit started working making bathing suits and underwear.  Someone wanted to work in her studio, and so she gave notice that she would study at CAMPOALTO (a technical college).\r\n\r\nNow Ingrit is studying hotel management, putting in maximum effort on her part, because her mother is paying for her tuition.

She also hopes to raise the male calves for meat and the females for milk (if they have the traits needed for milk cows).\r\n\r\nWith this purchase, she will be able to develop her business activity and at the same time save some money that will allow her to have more animals and invest more in her property.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe main source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. They own a plot of land, where they grow potatoes. The family also has four milking cows, a calf, and eight sheep. They milk the cows to make dairy products, and from the sheep they get wool and also cheese. Harvested potatoes, with the dairy products, are sold locally at the market.\r\n\r\nRecently, Valodia requested a loan from Credo to restart a family business. His loan request was approved, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Valodia wants to start trading in household goods and clothes. He and his wife had a business like this, a few years ago. Because they are already experienced in this field, Valodia decided to restart the business. The loan will be used for purchasing a stock of household goods and clothes at the wholesale price, which will be distributed at the local markets.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

a 35-year-old married mother of one, lives in Kyotera with her husband and two step children. A fish monger since 1996, Jane managed to acquire several plots of land in Kyotera and now has some rental housing in Kinankole zone that provides a secondary source of income for her family.<p>\r\n\r\nJane began selling fish because Kyotera is located near the shore of Lake Kijjanabalora, which has high quality tilapia fish.

She is a young mother to two small children, who are her reason for living and for moving ahead. She is part of the \"Buenas Amistad\" (\"Good Friendship\") group, which is made up of five members.

It is composed of six members and is directed by a board, of which Claudia is president. The members of the communal bank have a variety of businesses. Among them are: selling fruit, selling food, customer service at a neighborhood store, making polleras (traditional Andean skirts), selling soft drinks, and knitting blankets.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit small microbusinesswomen like Claudia. She says that this is the first time she has been part of Pro Mujer, joining at the invitation of a friend who is a member of the institution. Currently she has a business selling food, the same one she decided to open on the recommendation of her mother several years back.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will now take out is to increase capital (purchasing rice, beans, and oil) that she will obtain from the fairs in the city of La Paz to subsequently prepare and sell at the fairs in a community. This form of work allows her to generate income to support her household as much as possible, since she is single and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the savings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1326060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, beans, and oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10909.08,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1740.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":255.23,"local_amount":1740.2,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1764.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625453,"comment":null},{"amount":268.95,"local_amount":1833.73,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1858.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021410,"comment":null},{"amount":268.94,"local_amount":1833.73,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:31:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1858.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809218,"comment":null},{"amount":268.95,"local_amount":1833.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1858.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669288,"comment":null},{"amount":268.95,"local_amount":1833.73,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1858.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915049,"comment":null},{"amount":268.98,"local_amount":1833.96,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1859.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197680,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-07T22:34:08Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T18:31:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":544950,"name":"Jumah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jumah is a 33-year-old single man.

He is the father for one son and one daughter. Muhammad works as an employee, with a low wage. He would like to offer better life conditions for his family, by buying some home appliances for his home, especially a refrigerator.\r\n\r\nMuhammad took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN. This loan will help him cover the cost of buying a new refrigerator for his home. Muhammad appears in the Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs.
