In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMargarita hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a better living.

Thanks to the water loan program with a special rate offered by Hattha Kaksekar Limited, Chrep is encouraged to focus on ensuring healthy living conditions, to safeguard the health of her family and to protect the environment.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1510601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to pay for labor and materials to build a latrine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.1 103.2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chrep","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666700},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666700},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666700},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666700},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666700},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T19:44:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646544,"name":"Epefania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epefania is 55 years old and married with nine children. \r\n\r\nEpefania is in the agricultural business, pig fattening in the Philippines.

She sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of her family's income. \r\n\r\nTo continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Arevhat needs to make some investments. A loan of USD 3,000 will help this hard working woman and her family a lot by enabling her to purchase forage for cattle and to pay for the transportation and harvesting services. \r\n\r\nAs this is Arevhat\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. \r\n\r\nArevhat and her family rely on the goodwill of the lenders, and will appreciate their support in collecting the needed amount of the loan to maintain and develop their agribusiness.

Jactan has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 34 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJactan is 79 years old and has been a farmer for 68 years.  Jactan works as a farmer to provide for his 12 children.  The community and other farmers know Jactan as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community such as the Men's Group, Savings Group, Prayer Group and the Burial Committee.  Jactan described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of the One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nJactan joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Jactan joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  Because he likes being a leader, and he is an active community member, Jactan wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Jactan has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Jactan's life because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, has more farm group support, is able to save money and feed the family.  In the future, Jactan hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Jactan and the Baraka Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jactan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":181866,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181866}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646553,"name":"Liem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liem is 29 years old and is married.

Asmani has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and he is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 71 other individual farmers represented by this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAsmani is 63 years old and has been a farmer for 40 years. Asmani works as a farmer to provide for his five children. The community and other farmers know Asmani as friendly, hardworking, reliable, and trustworthy. Besides farming, he is also involved in his community, such as the savings group and prayer group. Asmani described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAsmani joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Asmani joined One Acre Fund so that he can get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, and earn enough to feed his family. Because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Asmani has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Asmani's life because he has more profits from his harvest, and was able to feed the family. In the future, Asmani hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and invest in a business.  \t\t\t\t\n\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low, and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Asmani and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer packages from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues to provide training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

He hopes that this strategy will work positively and customers will be attracted to his new products.\n\nHe would not have been able to implement his strategy without some capital, and had therefore requested for a loan from the Kiva\u2019s field partner with which he purchased the additional spare parts. M. Ijaz is tension free after taking the loan because BRAC showed him a beam of hope in the darkness. He is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan. \n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1504671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy automobile spare parts to sell.

The two could not proceed to college due to financial constraints and now they have joined their mother in the farming business. The family depends on the 3 acre piece of land for agriculture and dairy farming to get income for their basic needs. They grow vegetables and cereal for their food, and fodder for their 5 cows.\r\n\r\nAfter a training in their group about Biogas by VEP officials, Tabitha approached VEP to have a Biodigester constructed for her. All she would need is money and the expertise offered by VEP and many of her problems especially fuel problems would be solved. She now appreciates that money spent buying charcoal and kerosine can be saved, by using biogas for cooking and lighting. She will also practice organic farming by using bio-slurry which will lead to higher yield. This way she can have enough food for the family and probably sell some. With the savings and a little income she hopes her daughters can enroll in a college for a diploma course and this will give them a better future. For sure biogas will improve their livelihoods."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1512194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to construct a biodigester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T20:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T20:10:22Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabitha  Wanjiru","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4159}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T03:49:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":644965,"name":"Anita Guillermina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Anita Guillermina, mayor de edad casada  originaria del municipio de Chinandega ubicado en el occidente del pa\u00eds, se caracteriza por ser una mujer trabajadora, responsables con ganas de superaci\u00f3n personal, Lamentablemente por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos no pudo terminar sus estudios, debido a que tuvo que trabajar para ayudar con los gastos del hogar,anteriormente se dedicaba a la compra venta de chatarra pero con el nuevo financiamiento decide poner una pulperia en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n donde ofrece productos comestibles y en cantidades peque\u00f1as como sobre de caf\u00e9, sobre de shampoo, salsa de tomate,aceite, arroz, frijoles, jugos, pan, huevos, sal, az\u00facar, leche, productos congelados, entre otros su jornada diaria empieza desde muy temprano al abrir su pulperia para atender a sus clientes .

Sarah is happy that at last they have accessed gas, which will enable her to reduce the cost of fuel used for cooking for her visitors and also help preserve the trees. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8.33,"image":{"id":1487031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to pay for LPG cooking appliance in order to reduce the amount of firewood used for home cooking","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Seguku - Entebbe Road","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":343,"posted_date":"2013-12-17T20:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T20:30:18Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":240000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":8.33,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":21042.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439878879,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T20:46:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":658160,"name":"Lida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lida, de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera y no tiene hijos, vive en la casa de su madre junto a ella, adem\u00e1s de su hermana y una sobrina.

This group consists of 11 members and is led by a Board of Directors in which Sra. Vanesa serves as the secretary.  The members of this Communal Bank engage in various businesses such as making sportswear, selling baby sweaters, providing day care services, managing a neighborhood store, selling gifts, selling lettuce, selling beds, and selling woven clothing.\r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Sra. Vanesa.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer two years ago after receiving an invitation from a friend who is also a member of the organization.  Vanessa currently has a neighborhood store as her business.  She is knowledgeable about this type of work because she learned it from her sister, who also has the same type of business in her area.  For this reason, she decided to replicate the business because her neighbors needed a place to shop.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying noodles, sugar, oil, rice, and other products.

He is married and has four children. He is engaged in breeding cows and bulls. His family supports him in the business. Instead of a shepherd, his elder son takes the cattle to pasture. Sherali bought his son a horse, in order to be able to easily bring their cattle to pasture.
