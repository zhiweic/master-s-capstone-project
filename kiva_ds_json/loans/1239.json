Currently, her husband and sons are working in Russia, and Nargis lives in the city of Vahdat with her daughter.  Nargis is a skilled worker.  She has been earning a living by providing seamstress services for 20 years.  She sews women's dresses to order and makes beautiful embroideries on them.  Her services are always in demand because the majority of women prefer to purchase fabrics and have dresses custom-made for them.  Now Nargis is planning to expand her business and purchase a new modernized sewing machine, with the help of which her work process would improve.  She wants to use the rest of the loan money to make repairs at home in order to prepare for the winter cold.  She really needs the loan and promises to repay it on-time from her sewing business and money transfers from her husband."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":208.39,"image":{"id":1452524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a new modernized sewing machine and make repairs at home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vahdat","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nargis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":104.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.28,"local_amount":104.28,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":104.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561573,"comment":null},{"amount":104.11,"local_amount":104.11,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":104.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030475,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T13:44:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616696,"name":"Ronna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronna is a married woman from the town of Trinidad, Bohol.

Prior to this business, Nandini's husband was running a tailoring center and was earning a monthly income of 3,000 INR (Indian rupees), which was not at all sufficient to manage the household expenses along with the study expenses of her children. \n\nSo, Nandini discussed the situation with her husband and started this business. Now her fancy store is running well. Nandini brings the stock from different towns like Titilagarh, Bargarh, Raipur, etc. In the present situation, Nandini is earning a monthly income of 3,000 INR and supporting her family. But she has a dream to earn more and establish herself well, so she wants to increase the volume of her business to increase the income. \n\nThis year, Nandini, along with three other like-minded women of her town, formed a group named \u201cOmm Sairam\u201d and availed a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. From this loan amount of 10,000 INR, Nandini wants to invest the entire amount to purchase ladies\u2019 footwear, which will be a new item for her business. She hopes this will attract the women from her locality and fetch a handful of income to her. \n\nNandini hopes to construct a good cabin for her business and give better education to her children.\n\nThe other three energetic group members are Mita, Sunita and Pramila, who are doing a beauty parlor, dry wash center, and general store business respectively.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1446103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase ladies' footwear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T18:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T18:50:12Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nandini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":44000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T04:52:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616622,"name":"Ghazala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ghazala is a 48-year-old, hard working and independent woman.

She and her husband have owned a boutique for 5 years, which is the only source of income for their family. Now for the further growth of their business Razia has requested a loan from KIVA partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase some equipment for the boutique. As their family expenditures are much higher as compared to the monthly income and savings, Razia wants to expand her boutique. As a result, they will be able to increase their monthly income as well as savings. Her dreams are for the higher education of her children. She is very thankful to KIVA for such great help and

Gulbayra has a secondary education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, Gulbayra is involved in animal husbandry, having started 20 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulbayra's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 calf and 20 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).

With the previous loans, all of which she paid back successfully, Maua opened her new clothes and bags business, paid for chicken feed and kept on repairing her chickens' place. She used her profit to pay school fees and part of the house's food expenses. Maua will use this loan to add more chicks to her poultry business and increase the store of feed for her chickens. She dreams that one day she will be able to buy a plot of land where she can conduct her poultry-raising and other farming business. \r\nMaua will share this loan with her loan group \u201cSalasala\" which has 5 members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1161.51,"image":{"id":1448923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to add more chicks to her poultry business and increase the store of feed for her chickens.

She has been involved in baking flatbread in her city of Dushanbe for about three years.  She bakes flatbread in a national oven - tandoor.  Jamilya first prepares the dough and lets it sit.  Then she divides it into pieces and rolls them flat, and then attaches them to the walls of the fire oven.  The photograph shows Jamilya and behind her you can see the tandoor and flatbread in front of her.  A holiday is approaching soon, and all residents will set up tables to treat guests.  Jamilya wants to purchase several bags of flour with the loan money in order to bake more flatbread.  National flatbread is the main dish on a holiday table.  For Tajiks, bread and wheat are valuable sources of food.

He now has a job that requires working in two shifts--one from 3 a.m. until 11 a.m. and the other from 3:30 p.m. until 7 p.m.--which doesn't allow him time to study.\r\n\r\nHis biggest dream is to have his own business that would generate good income and allow him more free time to finish school. Klever has applied for a loan to make that dream possible. He will invest to start a chicken farm. This business idea was born from the fact that there are many restaurants in the area that sell chicken soups and stews and would be the potential market for this enterprising man. Klever knows a lot about the business because, when he was young, he helped his father on their small farm and became an expert in raising animals. \r\n\r\nKlever thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva for giving him the chance to realize his dream and for believing in his entrepreneurial spirit.

It is for this reason that this time she has decided to seek a second loan with which she will be able to sow the seedlings that she currently has in a large quantity, and prepare the land once again for the new product, which is necessary for the maintenance and protection of the crop in order to obtain good results."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0.36,"image":{"id":1452891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to prepare the land to grow new coffee seedlings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.27,"local_amount":5.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042244,"comment":null},{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":1.75,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710585,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T06:37:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621072,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 es un joven, emprendedor, actualmente se desempe\u00f1a como Director de un n\u00facleo educativo rural  con 9 a\u00f1os de experiencia, tambi\u00e9n imparte clases los fines de semana en una comunidad donde labora, es soltero con 1 peque\u00f1a ni\u00f1a a la que le est\u00e1 brindando todo el apoyo para su desarrollo, este se\u00f1or visito ceprodel para solicitar un financiamiento que le urge para invertirlo en la reparaci\u00f3n de su motocicleta como es la compra de tanque, pist\u00f3n, anillos, cadena de tiempo, llantas, asiento.

The members are Leticia (Lety), Adelina, Juana, Juliana, Benita, Hilaria, Graciela, and No\u00e9.  All the group members except Lety have asked for loans to use to buy lambs.  Leticia chose the name of the group because when she was invited to submit a loan request to VisionFund she was very impressed by it and it seemed like a great option for her.  For this reason, it was \"surprising\" to her when they arrived at her house to invite her to submit a loan application.\n\nLety is 39 years old and has been married to Jos\u00e9 for 20 years.  Together, they have formed a family and have 4 children, all of whom are currently in school.  Lety says that she has worked making embroidery, tablecloths, and basic clothes for several years.  She says that \"I got started out of necessity.  I lost my mother when I was little and I had to somehow learn how to work so I could help support my siblings.  Now, I do the same thing but instead work to support my children.\"\n\nCurrently, she is asking for a loan so she can make tablecloths and buy wool yarn, thread, and fabric.  Lety is very happy and grateful to Vision Fund because they have become a financial support to her family.  Even though her greatest difficulty is competition, she doesn't pay it much mind.  To the contrary, she does the best work she can so her customers will return to solicit her services as a seamstress.  \n\nHer profits have been very good and this has allowed her to improve her house.  In the past, Lety didn't have her own house and lived with her parents.  Now, however, she is very happy because she has not only been able to obtain her own house but has also been able to let her daughters study in private schools.\n\nLety and the rest of the group are very grateful to Vision Fund and to Kiva for the loans that they have been given and for all their services such as training and financial bonuses, which are very good.

This university is one of the best universities in Central Asia. I would like to become a highly qualified lawyer, as high qualified specialists are always in demand. AUCA gives great academic, professional, and social opportunities to its students. It is the first university in Central Asia offering liberal humanitarian academic programs, accredited in the USA. Graduates of AUCA gain diploma accredited in Bard College, USA. Many graduates of AUCA continue studying in such reputable educational institutions as Harvard, Yale, University of Indiana, Sorbonne, CEU, etc. \r\n\r\nAnother positive side of AUCA is that it gives financial support to almost all its students.

","en":"Janatkhon, age 42, is a responsible and positive woman as well as a kind and caring mother.  She is married and she has three lovely young children.  Her husband is currently in Russia where he is making a living working as a construction worker.  He makes a reasonable income, which he sends to his family every month.  \n\nJanatkhon herself has been running her own business for almost seven years, which also helps to meet all her family's needs.  She bakes pastries such as cakes and biscuits and she conducts her business in her own, small, bakery shop.  A few other bakers also work in her shop, as Janatkhon cannot handle all the work herself.\n\nJanatkhon wants to buy some goods that she needs for baking, as well as some additional equipment.  As winter is approaching and food prices may go up, she would like to buy everything she can now.  For this purpose, she has turned to MDO Arvand and would like to receive a loan to buy baking goods.  She thanks Arvand in advance for their financial support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":542.8,"image":{"id":1443318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is single, and has been in the maize farming business for the past four years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizers during maize production: they need to buy fertilizer in order to increase their production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She was born in 1957 in the city of Isfara, Tajikistan. She is married and has four children. She has a high school education. She owns her own business. Matluba provides sewing services and sells women's clothes. Her husband works in a mill producing building materials. One of their sons is a migrant worker in Russia. Her daughter-in-law also helps out with the business.\r\n\r\nMatluba loves her work very much and wants to expand the business.

Primitiva has seen very good results in this business because, as she mentions, there is limited access to the faraway villages outside of town, from where the majority of the inhabitants need to travel to purchase food, sell their crops or carry out work. Therefore, she recently purchased another vehicle with which she is making more profits, but she continues to save since the new acquisition left her without any capital. This is her sixth loan cycle with Kiva, and she is grateful for the financial support to help her make progress with her business. She promises to make her payments on time. With the loan, Primitiva plans to purchase various small animals to continue her livestock business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1452995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase animals such as pigs, chickens, sheep and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-18T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-17T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Primitiva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T04:08:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621115,"name":"Alma Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alma de 51 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a la venta de tortillas en su casa desde hace 18 a\u00f1os trabaja de lunes a domingo, tiene mucha clientela pues es una persona muy trabajadora y amable, con las ganancias que obtiene logra solventar los gastos de su hogar, vive en casa propia con su esposo y sus dos hijos.

Madinabonu's husband is a wage worker and her daughter is in school. Madinabonu has worked for five years in the sewing business. She takes orders for sewing women's national dresses. On average she embroiders one dress a day and by request of her clients she mostly sews dresses with embroidery, because it is today's dress fashion.

He started his business 10 years ago in his district of Hamadoni. In Hamadoni, many residents practice agriculture, including sowing wheat. The residents themselves are Shuhrat's raw material suppliers. Shuhrat has been very lucky as a businessman, as he does not have to go far for his raw materials or order them from another district. Shahrut's brother helps him with his business. Until now, they have been doing the processing by hand. Now Shuhrat is requesting a loan to purchase a special machine for flour grinding. He wants to order the milling machinery from the city of Dushanbe. This kind of equipment is very expensive, which is why he did not have enough money for it and requested a loan. Thanks to this machinery, work at the workshop will go much faster, the quality of the product (flour) will get better and their work shop will prosper."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":194.04,"image":{"id":1450068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy milling machinery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Hamadoni","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-10-18T10:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-17T10:40:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shuhrat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":299.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":307.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":316.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":325.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":334.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":343.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":352.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":362.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":372.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":382.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":393.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":403.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":415},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":426.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":438.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":450.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":462.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":475.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":488.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":501.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":515.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":529.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":544.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":558.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.94,"local_amount":299.7,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":300.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419913436,"comment":null},{"amount":64.66,"local_amount":307.9,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":308.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561581,"comment":null},{"amount":66.44,"local_amount":316.4,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":316.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030483,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-20T08:37:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":620522,"name":"David Felix","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"David tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, trabaja en su peque\u00f1o negocio de venta de helados y con los ingresos de su humilde negocio saca adelante a su familia, la cual est\u00e1 conformada por su esposa y sus 5 hijos;

is an experienced agronomist from the village of Masis in the Ararat region. She lives with her husband and her son. To earn a living, Gohar is engaged in raising two pigs, and in cultivation of tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, alfalfa, and some fruits (peaches, apricots, plums, blood oranges and apples). Farming is the main source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nGohar's husband and son help her greatly in getting the agricultural produce to the local market. Gohar cultivates plants in two greenhouses. As their needs are growing day by day, she needs to enlarge her agricultural business a little bit, to meet the daily needs of her family more effectively. As this is Gogar's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF.

He is married with three children between the ages of seven and eleven years old. He would like to use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production.  He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
