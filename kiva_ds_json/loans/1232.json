He is married with two children aged 10 years.  In 1991, Abdul established his slippers business. He began his business because after he completed sixth form, his family could not afford to pay his college fees. He raised money to start up his business, and before that he was a massuer. He works at the business ten hours per day and seven days per week.

As do all his neighbours, A'zamkhon keeps cattle for his family's personal needs. Now he is requesting a loan to buy a pair of steers and run a business fattening and selling big-horned cattle. The amount he is borrowing to start his business is small, since some breeds of cows and steers cost a lot. A'zamkhon has decided not to take a chance with such a large sum. First he wants to acquire the necessary experience in the business and then he plans to expand it.

These Kiva funds can make her life better and more comfortable."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":213,"image":{"id":1441071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to build a latrine and dig a well for water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 105.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T15:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T15:20:01Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Non","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T09:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420254225,"comment":null},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429518794,"comment":null},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439742918,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-10T06:54:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615184,"name":"Shabana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shabana is a 34-year-old, married woman and a mother of five.

She might also use part of the loan to buy necessary embroidery needs to expand her business.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, one day, her customers will increase, which is the main target she is working on achieving, and then move to a larger shop in the future.   \r\n   "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":373.5,"image":{"id":1444116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to change her shop's decorations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Metn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T16:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T16:00:11Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:20:51Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419762460,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429412537,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439630523,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-14T12:36:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618150,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa, de 28 a\u00f1os es una mujer sencilla.

Yet it is still one of the poorest countries in Africa, with an average household income of just $1.45 per day. Nearly 80% of Rwanda\u2019s population lives in its mountainous rural terrain. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves estimates that over 8.5 million people in Rwanda are affected by household air pollution caused by cooking over open fires.  \n\nThe Paradigm Project has long been passionate about working in Rwanda to help alleviate the burden on household finances and health that is caused by cooking over open fires. We launched our EzyLife brand in Rwanda in 2012 in anticipation of finding a great business partner whom we could work with to build a local EzyLife business. \n\nWe first met Amri, who founded SERVE and SMILE to help bring life-improving products to the people of Rwanda, when he joined our campaign to pilot a market-based system for delivering cookstoves and solar lights to rural Rwanda. After nearly a year of working together, we are delighted to help Amri launch his own business in Rwanda with a Kiva loan that will purchase 2,880 cookstoves.\n\n\u201cThis loan will make our company dream comes true by stepping to the bottom of the pyramid as we are solving problems of the poor at the same time creating jobs in rural areas, mostly to women entrepreneurs (village agents),\u201d said Amri when he heard about the Kiva loan opportunity. \n\nAmri will launch his business in partnership with two unique groups: he will work with CARE, an international non-profit organization that is working with EzyLife to train 100 women entrepreneurs in rural areas who will do direct sales of Amri\u2019s cookstoves. He will also work with a vast network of community groups supporting survivors of the genocide, also helping to recruit and train women as cookstove entrepreneurs and sales agents. Through these two groups, there is already vast demand for the product \u2013 Amri is worried about having enough stoves to serve everyone in need! With this Kiva loan, he will be able to purchase enough stoves to satisfy the growing demand and sell them at a profit so that he can continue to grow his business in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":18725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1445819,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2888,"youtubeId":"qoFc5aN2j0w","title":"Kiva Borrower Amri from Rwanda","thumbnailImageId":1445819},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy clean cookstoves to sell to women's groups","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.953611 30.060556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":286,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":18725,"lender_count":632,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":18720,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":18725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4580.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4693.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4713.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4732.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4582.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4694.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4714.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4733.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T16:26:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618133,"name":"Eldi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

municipality of San Antonio, Suchitep\u00e9quez, Guatemala.  They gave this name to their group because they hope that with their hard work and the support of Namaste money management classes and the Namaste Business Advisor they will meet their business objectives, increase their incomes, and improve their lives.  These women are all very poor, have very little education and live in very simple houses, some with dirt floors.  They have a variety of businesses such as local clothing sales, corn and corn meal sales, chicken meat sales, meal preparation and a very small store.\n\nDo\u00f1a Tiburcia (1st from left) is a 58-year-old widow with a third-grade education, and 11 children, all grown up.  Her husband was killed 11 years ago in a robbery.  At that time she did not work, but she had to earn money.  She started working in a nursery, saving a little money so that she could someday start her own business.  After a few years she was able to start selling snacks and then started a small store in front of a public school.  Her goal is to increase her inventory of the items that the mothers and children at the school want to buy.\n\nTiburcia has been invited by the local public school to talk on Mother\u2019s Day to tell her story.

The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing, as well as seed and fertilizer from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T19:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T19:20:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Vedaste\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":491625,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":491625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T13:46:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615225,"name":"Erica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erica is married with two children, both of whom attend school.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing, as well as seed and fertilizer from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer and pay for labor costs ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Jean Nepomuscene\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":600875,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-23T09:30:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615233,"name":"Maferah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 50-year-old Maferah from Jui eastern area in Freetown.

is 48 years old.

With profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Odette\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":874000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":874000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T16:59:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615235,"name":"Muasya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muasya is a businesswoman who is very hard-working.

She lives there with her husband Rolando and her 22-year-old son, both of whom mean everything to her.  By nature, she is a very cheerful and sincere woman.  Nora sells hand-woven textiles from her stall in the craft centre in the town of San Pedro de Cajas.  She makes the clothes she sells herself and they are quickly snapped up by her customers because of her innovative designs.  She also stocks clothing made with different types of loom as well as tapestries from other local artisans.  Her favourite aspect of her work is weaving and developing her creative skills.  She has been doing this kind of work for 7 years and believes that the hardest part is having to remain behind her stall all day without being able to leave it.  She does not let this get her down, though, because she knows that she has to sell her goods as quickly as she can so that she can have a day off every 3 weeks. When her husband gets home from the mine where he works, they spend most of their time together.  In addition to running her textile business, she also does some farming, planting potatoes once a year.  Because she is achieving her goals, she hopes that, in time, she will be able to have a bigger shop where she can serve her customers more comfortably.  This is her fourth KIVA loan and she is very grateful for the financial help, as it will enable her to improve her income.  She guarantees that she will repay her loan punctually.

He has six children and has been a maize farmer for the past 30 years. He will use this Kiva loan to pay for labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer to increase his production. He wishes to invest the profits from his farming in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay labor costs and purchase fertilizer ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":819375,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":819375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-12T18:34:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615255,"name":"Bith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bith is 61 years old and a loving mother of seven children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to support labor and fertilizer costs during maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean Nepomuscene\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":874000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":874000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-04T19:13:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615290,"name":"Jaminatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Jaminatu, a 38-year-old from Jui in the eastern area from Freetown.

With the profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that, in the future, he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Yeama, she is in her late forties and lives in Jui eastern area in Freetown.

Each town prizes its own unique designs and many consider those from the large town of Chichicastenango to be among the most intricate and exquisite. They are handmade and very durable.\r\n\r\nChicua is a small, poor community near the town. Men, women and children face daily struggles to survive and move forward in their lives. The seventeen hard-working women of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, \u201cLas Chicualenses\u201d have a vision for a better future, and look forward to their monthly meetings.\r\n\r\nThey are currently requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge, which will be their second loan cycle.

The ladies have large families and are committed to providing for their children. They realize that education is a real key to a more successful future.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary for this loan cycle is 24 year old Antonia. As is customary for unmarried women in the rural, indigenous communities of Guatemala, Antonia lives with her parents and siblings. She was only able to attend school until she reached the 4th grade. Since childhood, Antonia has been using her talents to embroider and weave. Currently, she owns an embroidery business and makes beautiful sashes and blouses. As her business is growing, Antonio decided to apply for her second loan with Friendship Bridge, which she will use to purchase various high quality thread. Antonia will plan carefully as she wants to take advantage of the special orders that she has received. She anticipates more sales as the holidays approach.

She says that she started selling her clothing door-to-door to her neighbors, friends and family members. She never liked to sell in squares or markets. In addition she always gave her customers the convenience of buying in two payments, and so far continues to do so. However this is Ange's greatest concern because many times people never finish paying her. \"I would like to sell on credit, but I understand we are in a community where there are not many sources of income, and even though I need the money right away and ask for immediate payment, I could lose customers\". \r\n\r\nAngie only sold clothing, but when she had the opportunity of having her own shop, her husband encouraged her to sell candy. She started by buying very small boxes of candy and now already has a table full of candy, cookies and soft drinks. \r\n\r\nAnge's business is very productive; she has many customers although there also days when sales are low. Ange's only goal is to succeed in expanding her business so that she can have sufficient revenue and be able to help her daughter with her education expenses.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance, in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market, and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-10T02:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-09T02:10:01Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janvier\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":874000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":874000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T17:41:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615433,"name":"Asma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asma belongs with to an ultra poor family, living with her spouse and two children in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.\r\n \r\nHer husband has been providing services making iron doors, windows, and fixing broken accessories with the help of welding plant (arc welder).\r\n\r\nFew days ago his welding plant malfunctioned due to overheating, and he wants to buy a new welding plant.

Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\"I studied at physics \u2013 mathematics school-lyceum No61 and was always interested in mathematics. In senior classes, we started having lessons in economics which were very interesting, especially the role of mathematics in economics. That is why I decided to continue developing my interests and enroll in the economics department.  Also, my choice was influenced by the fact that economics is an integral part of daily life. A person deals with economy when they think how much money they have to save for a new purchase, how much they have to pay for repairs, how the inflation influences their salary, how to save money etc.  Economy also helps to answer the issues in the sphere of entrepreneurship and economic activity, how to determine what it means to increase the net profit and to provide employees with satisfactory salary, how the relations with foreign partners influence activities, and supply and demand at the market. The knowledge of economy allows me to follow and understand the situations in the world. Today our country is in need of competent specialists in different areas.  The economy of our country is unstable and I would like to help Kyrgyzstan. Our country has a great potential. I have a possibility to make an effort to improve the economic situation of our country.\r\nThe American University in Central Asia is one of the leading universities in Kyrgyzstan, keeping up with the times, and its graduates are recognized with employment. AUCA is a basic step for many successful people. In Kyrgyzstan, you can meet graduates of AUCA who can perform their duties at an excellent level. I would also like to take an active role in the social life of AUCA. \r\nAUCA is the place that I always was looking for, the place where I wanted to be and I am happy that my dream came true.\"\r\n  \r\nAt the same time, Nelly wonders about the financial part of this issue, as her family cannot afford paying the tuition fees. But she doesn\u2019t want money to stop her from her studies. A Kiva loan would let Nelly be more concentrated on her studies, not on thinking about how to earn money for her tuition. The American University of Central Asia has been the university of her dreams for years and she doesn\u2019t want financial restrictions to be a barrier for her future success.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1444560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Due to Eid ul Azha, she has lot of pending work for completion but without a speedy machine it seems impossible to sew cloths before Eid.\r\nTherefore, Nargis requested a loan to buy a Juki sewing machine so that she could sew cloths by a specific time. She expects that with the help of a new machine she can complete her tasks in very short time.  In this way, she could spend more time with her family and could generate income as well.\r\nNargis is very thankful to Kiva and to its field partner BRAC Pakistan. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":70.9,"image":{"id":1444127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a Juki sewing machine for her tailoring business.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nSonia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nSonia hopes to expand her business, and dreams to have a good life and happy family.

He lives with his wife, two children and parents-in-law in a small village in the Akhaltsikhe district. His children go to the local school and his parents-in-law are provided with a retirement pension. Paata has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, as his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Paata was unable to study a professional career. Paata works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize and haricot. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Paata decided to start dairy farming and sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe start-up program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to receive a loan of 2,500 GEL for purchasing two cows.  \r\n\r\nAfter the cows are purchased, the family will start producing dairy products such as cheese and yogurt for selling. They will also use the milk products for family feeding. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative will give Paata a chance to achieve financial stability and earn a better monthly income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":345.37,"image":{"id":1444656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Giorgitsminda","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-10-10T09:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-09T09:20:04Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paata","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.46},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":375.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":381.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255616,"comment":null},{"amount":116.21,"local_amount":190.51,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":193.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019744,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-08T03:29:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":617662,"name":"1Ero De Mayo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Alejo es uno de los miembros del grupo 1Ero de Mayo. \u00c9l se ha dedicado al comercio desde hace 7 a\u00f1os; platica que siempre ha vivido en la misma colonia y donde decidi\u00f3 poner una tienda de abarrotes con la intenci\u00f3n de brindar un servicio a sus vecinos y ganar su propio dinero. \u00c9l dice que inici\u00f3 vendiendo s\u00f3lo refrescos y dulces y poco a poco el negocio ha crecido y actualmente es una tienda de abarrotes. \u00c9l piensa que lo que hace diferente su tienda de es el buen servicio y sus precios.
