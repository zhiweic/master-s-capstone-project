Approximately four years ago, she decided to operate a store out of her home in order to be able to take care of her children and help pay for their education. Milena is an educated woman with certifications in beauty salon and nail services. She is a woman who strives to excel and always improve. Her newest business has allowed her to financially support her children in their education. She manages her store in a very organized manner, every day she records her daily and monthly accounting so that she can track exactly how money comes and goes in her business. Her business is registered with the city and she has obtained all the legal permits necessary to operate it. \r\n\r\nMilena started this store with 70000 colones given to her from her husband so that she could buy merchandise. From there she began to develop her business and equip herself to diversify her services, for instance, by offering manicures and pedicures. She owns salon equipment and is currently taking her third course in a well-known cosmetology school. Two years ago, she began offering her manicure and pedicure services. Milena manages a portfolio of credit customers, those who patronize her business regularly, thanks to the ease of payment. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy merchandise (clothing, perfume, cosmetics, lingerie) and equipment (enamels and other foot and nail products). With this, she hopes to increase her profits since recently she has had limited working capital. After attending a meeting with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and hearing about its partnership with Kiva, she saw the possibility to realize her dream of saving money to buy her own house and be able to give her children a better quality education so they will become professionals.\r\n\r\nThis year, her husband's illness left her to confront their household expenses alone. Thanks to her hard work, she was able to overcome this situation and now her husband is back to work in his transportation

lives in the Malindi area of Coast province, Kenya.  She is a married mother of six school-going children and she owns a charcoal stall, which she has been operating for two years.  She also earns some income from a salon. \n\nJoyce learned about Milango through a friend and joined in order to access credit to improve her business operations.

sons and 3 daughters. Her youngest son lives with her and helps her, and her other children are already adults. As the main breadwinner of the family, since 1997 Pazilat has worked in animal husbandry. She began this business with only 15,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS), purchasing 1 young calf and sheep. Thanks to her persistent hard work, today she has 10 sheep with lambs, 2 cows, and 1 horse. For the purpose of further developing her business, Pazilat has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 Som (KGS) to buy 15 head of sheep and feed for them. She plans to use the profit generated by this loan to expand her farm. She and her family have a long-held dream of buying a car.

married. As the main source of income for the family, 17 years ago she started her own business in animal husbandry and growing crops. Thanks to her persistent hard work, from a start-up capital of only 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS), she has managed to develop her farm to now include 2 dairy cows and 20 sheep, which generates an income of around 10,000 Som from the sale of milk and dairy products. Every year, the family work 2.8 hectares of land, where they annually grow beans and perennial herbs. For the purpose of further developing her business, Rakiyabubu has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som to buy bulls, since the prices are now low and a future rise is forecast. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to increase her herd, to host her son's wedding, and to build a large barn. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1062.5,"image":{"id":1248584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase 3 bulls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ozgorush village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-10T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-09T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rakiyabubu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50297.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426687,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-26T03:20:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":503889,"name":"Bolor-Erdene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Bolorerdene, 30 years old, lives with his wife and two children in a get (a traditional Mongolian home) in his father-in-law\u2019s fence.

Also, the family grows peanuts, maize, and different kinds of vegetables on the family-owned land. Darejani sells cheese and peanuts at the local open market. The harvested maize is used by the family for feeding the cattle. \r\n\r\nAll family members work hard, but the income is not enough for the six-member family. Darejani requested credit to expand a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions. These would be made available to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Darejani will purchase a milk cow. She will place it in the old cattle-shed located in her yard. She will produce more cheese and sell the cheese on the local open market. The income for the family will increase by 150 \u2013 200 GEL (Georgian Lari), a 45% to 60% increase. The living conditions for the family will significantly improve and the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

Both of them get a monthly salary. As the existing income is not enough for the family, Olgha decided to start a new business. In particular, she plans to renovate her garage properly and rent it for a good price. \r\n\r\nOlgha has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. However, her loan request was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, for they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this loan, Olgha will purchase building materials to renovate the garage properly so that it satisfies the personal needs of her clients. Olgha hopes her business will be profitable and this will increase her income, providing her family members with enough money to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living conditions. Olgha also plans to finance the education of her daughter.

She lives with Lino, who is a fisherman and is the father of her 5 children: Kety, 15, Marjory, 11, Karol,  8, Cintia, 5, and Mateo, who is 3 years old.  It is for them that she exerts herself, so that she can provide them with a better quality of life.  The family lives together in their own home, which was purchased with a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nMaribel has a business selling fresh fish.  She starts working very early when she goes to the port to receive the fish that her partner has caught, so that she can later sell it from her stall in the busiest market in the city.  She provides her customers with friendly service, knowing that in this way she will gain their preference so that they will keep buying from her.\r\n\r\nMaribel started this business more than 5 years ago with her own capital, which she invested in fishing supplies for her partner so that she could sell the fish that he caught.  Later, seeing how well her business was received, she started increasing her sales.  She considers her business to be quite profitable, because of the good earnings she gets and the strong demand for her products, particularly at times when there is a shortage and she can raise her prices.  \r\n\r\nMaribel decided to start up her business so that she could support her partner with the household expenses and support her large family.  Now, seeing the good results that she has, she wants to keep the business going and continue with it, as it is her only means of generating income.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Maribel's 4th loan with MFP, and she expects that with this small loan she will be able to meet her goals.  Also, she comments that she enjoys working with her communal bank, because she considers it to be a group of people who are united and cooperative.  With the sum of 1,200 Peruvian soles that she requests, she will purchase fishing supplies for her partner, such as: nets, harpoons, traps, fishing lines, fish hooks, and other supplies.  This way, she can obtain her main product, which is fresh fish.  She is hoping to increase the volume of fish that she sells, so that she can increase her earnings.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has been working as a librarian at a library for over three years.  She loves her work of providing and recommending useful books to readers.  She respects well-read people very much.  Umedakhon's salary is not enough for normal living and this is why she wants to start a new business in animal husbandry, especially because her local climate is quite suitable for growing agricultural crops and for animal husbandry.  She has a large garden, where she can grow hay for livestock.  She wants to sell milk to her neighbors.  She wants to organize and develop her business, but does not have enough financial means for this.  Umedakhon is requesting a loan in the amount of 3000 somoni to buy livestock.  She plans to use the resulting income to provide her children with a good education and current technology.

Through hard work, Bubuya today has in her homestead ten dairy cows with offspring, eight heads of bull, and five horses. Monthly income from the business is 25,000 Som from mile sales. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Bubuya appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som (KGS) to buy livestock.

","en":"Anar is 43 years old, married, and has six children. All the children and her husband help Anar with her business. Anar works with livestock breeding, which is their main source of income. \r\n\r\nAfter having started this business 12 years ago with a sum of 25,000 som (KGS), Anar has been able to develop her farm through persistent work. The monthly income is 4,000 som (KGS). Today the farm has 3 cows, 2 horses, 22 sheep and 3 calves. Thanks to the income from the farm, Anar can pay for the family's needs. Anar sells milk and dairy products from her home. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Anar turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of calves and lambs. This will in the future increase the amount of milk and therefore the family income. Anar plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business and in the future would like to fulfill her dream of repairing their house.

As a main income for the family, Gulnara works with livestock breeding and crop planting. After having started this business 18 years ago with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS), Gulmira has been able to develop her business thanks to persistent work. The monthly income is in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Today the farm counts 2 cows, 1 horse, 5 sheep and one tractor. Thanks to the income from the business, Gulmira is able to pay for the family's basic needs. Gulmira sells milk and dairy products from her home, as well as vegetables in the spring and fall. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulmira turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional livestock. This will increase the amount of milk and accordingly the family's income. Gulmira plans to invest the income in further developing her business, and in the future would like to repair her

He is married to a wonderful woman who does not work and is a good homemaker.  They do not have children yet and their dream is that their future children become educated and good people, so that they can be proud of their children.  Asadullo has been working as a policeman in the Department of Internal Affairs for several years.  He would like to grow his career and continue his development.

Yanush has 17 years of experience in this field thanks to his father, who taught him how to look after cattle. Selling milk and milk products to local markets helps Yanush earn a monthly income. But unfortunately, it is not enough to cover his big family\u2019s everyday costs. So, Yanush has applied for this loan. With the loan proceeds, he would purchase 25 lambs. He will raise and fatten them for five to six months and resell them at a profit in the local livestock bazaar.

is a wonderful woman with a beautiful soul and beautiful thoughts.  She is 31 years old, married and raising three children.  All of her children are adolescents.  Her husband is a very kind person, who works on a construction crew.  He is an ordinary construction worker and earns a small salary, which is not enough to support three children.  To improve their living conditions, Anastasiya has been working as a janitor at one of the secondary schools in her town for over four years.  She does her work very well, and this is why all of the students know her as \"auntie cleanness.\"  She likes when she hears this response from the students.  Anastasiya's salary is small and not sufficient to purchase all of the necessary items or for repairs.  She and her family live in an old house that does not meet the minimum living standards.  The floor of her house has holes, and she needs to urgently install another floor because roaches come out of the holes all the time.  Anastasiya is requesting a loan in the amount of 3500 somoni to purchase construction materials in order to install the floor.  This loan will help her to repair her house; thus, bringing convenience and comfort to her house.  She has a lot of plans for the future, such as buying new technology for home and furniture.  Anastasiya and her children will wait for kind creditors to help them resolve the housing problem.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1250729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is not married and lives with her parents.  She is a very hardworking and active woman.  She has had a lot of interest in sewing and cutting since childhood.  Thanks to her parents, she studied sewing from a seamstress.  Gulnoza is currently a capable seamstress.  To provide the family with all of the necessities, she started her own business four years ago.  She has her own sewing factory and apprentices.  Thanks to a good service, she has a wide circle of clients.  She teaches apprentices and serves her customers at the same time.  This year, her students learned a lot and started to help her.  Now she wants to expand her business.  She needs a new sewing machine for this, but her income does not allow her to purchase it.  Gulnoza is requesting a loan in the amount of 1500 somoni to purchase a new sewing machine.  She relies on you and your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1250774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

He is married and raising 2 children. His wife is a seamstress and tries to help her husband in providing for the family. The children are not yet adults. In order to provide the family with all necessary means, Safar started his business of providing taxi services 4 years ago. He serves his clients well, he has always a clean car and therefore the clients can have a nice ride in his car. \r\n\r\nSafar gets up early every day and washes his car and with an open mind and a smile on his lips goes to meet his clients. Thanks to his good service he has many clients, but lately his car, an Opel Vectra, has not been in a good condition. He urgently needs to repair it. If he does not repair it, he will lose clients who are very valuable to him. If he loses his business, the family's situation will be very difficult, as his wife's income is very small, and she is not able to support the family. \r\n\r\nSafar requests a loan in the amount of 1000 somoni for the repair of his car. This is his second loan, and he has a good credit history. Safar promises to repay the loan on time. He awaits your

He is married and has children. Ahmadjon's wife is a homemaker and is mostly concerned with raising the children. Ahmadjon is a very hardworking and responsible person. He tries to work a lot in order for his family not to need for anything. \r\n\r\nSince in his time Ahmadjon could not get an education, he has been engaged in selling yarn. According to his stories, this business provides a good income. Therefore, Ahmadjon is trying to develop this business as this is the only source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nWith the credit received, Ahmadjon wants to buy yarn and rope. He hopes that, with the help of this loan, he will be able to realize his plans. In the spring, he plans to give his eldest daughter in marriage, so he is buying thread and to save money until spring for the event. Ahmadjon is very grateful to Kiva for the financial support and understanding.

a father of three, is a landlord and welder in Mukuru, an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. He also participates in community projects that aim to improve the quality of life of Mukuru residents.<p>\r\n\r\nBenjamin got the opportunity to interact with a Fresh Life Toilet owner, a Field Officer and a member of the Waste Management Team from Sanergy before he decided to invest in a Fresh Life Toilet.

On occasion, she hires day laborers for the more difficult and large-scale work.\r\n\r\nShe likes her farmwork due to the fact that it is very peaceful work, and at the same time, it is possible to sample the coffee beans that she produces, so that she can feel that the very selfless work she does will be valued by the final consumers in other parts of the world. In spite of the rainy season, it is a difficult time when it is necessary to make sacrifices. But thanks to the work she has done, she can finally get good earnings with the sale of the dried beans to the collection centers, who value her crop at a fair price.\r\n\r\nBefore the start of the rainy season in the area, she wants to have working capital to acquire coffee plants, and for having it planted by the day laborers in the area, who also will carry out the weeding and clearing of her parcels of land.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, with the fruits of her labor and effort, she plans to realize the building of a home with good quality materials. She is proud to have had 17 loans with MFP, and this is a reflection of her reliability and sound investments. She feels very comfortable because of the harmonious atmosphere created by her fellow communal bank members. This makes each meeting a time for dialogue and motivation that everyone enjoys.\r\n\r\nWith the 1500 nuevos soles, she will purchase coffee plants for later planting, and hire day laborers for the weeding and clearing of her parcels, prior to the planting time and the rainy season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1252357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy coffee plants and hire day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-10T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-09T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":162.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":174.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":177.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":183.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":188.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":198.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":204.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":210.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.86,"local_amount":162.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189047,"comment":null},{"amount":69.86,"local_amount":174.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":180.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572954,"comment":null},{"amount":71.05,"local_amount":177.63,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":183.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122604,"comment":null},{"amount":73.56,"local_amount":183.9,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":189.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868429,"comment":null},{"amount":75.39,"local_amount":188.47,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":194.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577255,"comment":null},{"amount":79.4,"local_amount":198.51,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":204.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529496,"comment":null},{"amount":81.62,"local_amount":204.05,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":210.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974575,"comment":null},{"amount":84.26,"local_amount":210.64,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":217.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995991,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-11T22:52:44Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":505757,"name":"Juan Pablo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Juan tiene 22 a\u00f1os, el es  soltero  se dedica al  servicio de internet y dise\u00f1o grafico que se encuentran en la localidad  de Santa Rita,  este pr\u00e9stamo es el primera secuencia de su cr\u00e9dito dentro de la instituci\u00f3n   El joven Juan va a usar este pr\u00e9stamo para compra de computadoras para  su negocio, la  raz\u00f3n para solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo es la falta de mas computadoras ya que su clientela est\u00e1 incrementando y el desea darles un mejor servicio a sus clientes, El joven Juan enfrenta retos en su negocio que son competencia ya que existen varios caf\u00e9s internet en la zona pero el les trata muy amablemente a sus clientes y por esta raz\u00f3n siempre van a su negocio y va a utilizar los beneficios en seguir comprando muebles para su cafe internet.

To reach her dreams, she strives daily to do her work even though she lives far from the school where she teaches and must leave home at 5am in order to be punctual and be an exemplary teacher.\n\nLittle by little and with help from loans, she\u2019s built the essentials of her house but needs another loan to buy building materials like bricks, cement, roofing purlins and metal sheeting to continue with the project.  She trusts in God that Kiva through Ceprodel will approve her loan application so she can reach the goal of owning a house.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1248175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

Siray is going to use her share of the loan to buy clothing and cloth in large quantities to add to her current stock.  \r\n\r\n(Attached beneath the photo is Ramatu, a borrower who was not present for the group photo.)"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1252282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing and cloth in large quantities to add to her current stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2012-12-11T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-10T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Ramatulia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Jalia ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Siray ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":433922.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331236905,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T12:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":433922.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340104621,"comment":null},{"amount":99.88,"local_amount":429500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":433418.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347350173,"comment":null},{"amount":100.12,"local_amount":430500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-21T09:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":434427.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357089703,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":860000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":867845.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373022567,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":433922.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381810459,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":433922.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390670586,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":433922.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399916427,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":433922.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410398258,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-16T15:53:40Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:45:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":505674,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael is 39 years old, married and has three children.

With the improvements in her house, she hopes to have a more suitable place to live and an appropriate environment for the development of her children and to have more liquidity to be able to pay for their schooling, and thus they can have a better quality of life. This is her first loan from FUDECOSUR.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMarivic operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like rice, pork, chicken, fish, pasta and other ingredients. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarivic hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams of giving her children a good quality education. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married to Melanio, a security guard, and she is a mother to her children. Lorna, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLorna maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct sales catalogue, selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. \r\n\r\nDirect sales works as follows. A customer's order is bought in cash by a dealer (e.g., Lorna) and then the product is given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s costs are lower than the prices shown in the catalogue -- the difference between the dealer's cost and the catalogue price represents the profit that dealers generate as their income. \r\n\r\nLorna's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Lorna is requesting a 10000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products, like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLorna hopes to give her children a good, quality education and she dreams of having a good life for her family. She faithfully meets every week with her co-fellowship members where she can share stories of her work and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He is married and has 5 children. Two of his sons work at a market where they deliver food products. Abdumanon's wife takes care of the household and looks after their children, while helping her husband raise livestock in her free time. Abdumanon works as a small home repairman, but mainly earns a living by raising livestock. According to him, this latter activity brings a very good profit. Abdumanon has been working with livestock for over 10 years. He is a very positive and conscientious person.\r\n\r\nAbdumanon plans to use this loan to purchase animal feed. Since there is no fresh grass in wintertime, he is forced to purchase large quantities of animal fodder, and would like to stock up for the rest of the winter. Abdumanon will continue raising his livestock until the spring, when he will sell it at a profit. He is grateful to MDO Arvand for their financial support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1244094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-12-11T06:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-10T06:50:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdumanon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":93.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":103.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23.41,"local_amount":93.63,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":111.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568415,"comment":null},{"amount":24.18,"local_amount":96.71,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":115.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118072,"comment":null},{"amount":24.97,"local_amount":99.89,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":118.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863678,"comment":null},{"amount":25.79,"local_amount":103.18,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":122.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572619,"comment":null},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":106.59,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":126.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971385,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-11T13:58:51Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":505917,"name":"Luafulufa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luafulufa is 42 years old and married with seven children.

mathematician. With this in mind, she enrolled in the Tajik Ozodi University, where she is currently a 3rd-year student. Farangez is a very intelligent and hard-working young woman. She is doing well in her studies and participates in all of her university's extracurricular events. She has many friends who love and respect her.

She lives in a home of her own, along with her husband, 30 year old Victor, and her two children, seven year old Hugo, and 3 year old Virginia, to whom they want to provide a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nJackeline\u2019s business is fast food, specifically broasted chicken, beer, soft drinks, and ice.  Her stall is located in her home and she takes many cases of beer and soft drinks every weekend to replace the ones she has sold during the week.\r\n\r\nShe is a very happy and charismatic saleswoman.  This is why her customers prefer to buy from her.  She recalls when she was first starting out, she only sold just a small amount, but she managed to get more customers and increase her sales.\r\n\r\nThings are going very well for her and she generates a double income for having two activities, so she is able to provide better living conditions to her family.  What she likes the most is that she can talk to customers and make her working time go by faster.  She considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to transport the heavy cases of beer.  In the future she hopes to be able to set up a store where she can provide better service.\r\n\r\nThis will be her eighth loan through MFP and she hopes for your cooperation so she can continue her goals.  She is committed to making her payments on time, as with the previous ones.  She also likes being a part of the communal bank because all of its members are responsible and united.  She will use the 3,500 PEN to buy ingredients so that she can continue her business.  She will also buy many cases of soft drinks and beer to have on hand to sell over these dates.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1252313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-11T14:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-10T14:50:01Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackeline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":514.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":557.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":578.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":582.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":622.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":643.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":202.3,"local_amount":514.95,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":521.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572942,"comment":null},{"amount":219.17,"local_amount":557.89,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":564.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122592,"comment":null},{"amount":227.35,"local_amount":578.69,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":585.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868419,"comment":null},{"amount":228.91,"local_amount":582.7,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":590.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577245,"comment":null},{"amount":244.36,"local_amount":622.01,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":629.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529485,"comment":null},{"amount":252.91,"local_amount":643.76,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":651.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974572,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-26T11:35:47Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":505778,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruth, de 27 a\u00f1os, es una mujer sencilla vive con sus esposo Joder y sus 2 hijos: Jeanfranco y Iker, a los que cuida en una casa alquilada desde hace 2 a\u00f1os.
