pa\u00eds, Do\u00f1a Olga quien es la representante del grupo nos cuenta que tiene 58 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada desde hace 34 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Pablo por el momento ya no tienen ning\u00fan dependiente  todas viven en san pablo Tlachichilpa un lugar donde las personas son muy amables y trabajadoras do\u00f1a Olga se dedica  a la crianza y venta de animales esta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar borregos, pollos y ma\u00edz las cantidades son las sabe porque necesita ver los precios, en esta actividad lleva ya 30a\u00f1os desde que era peque\u00f1a sus padres se dedicaban a los mismos es por eso que ella tambi\u00e9n se dedica a lo mismos pero comenta que cundo era m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a los animales de sus padres se los llevaban a pastar ala campo pero los tiempos han cambiado ya no en donde pastar a los animales y tenemos que comprar les todos sus alimentos como, pastura, ma\u00edz molido, etc.\nEl reto m\u00e1s grande que presenta do\u00f1a Olga es cuando sus animales enferman y no tienen que tiene que gastar en el veterinario y medicamento, por ejemplo a los pollos cada mes se les debe comprar un polvo que se llama brebaje y a los borregos hay desparasitarlos.\nLa meta de do\u00f1a Olga es llegar a tener un ahorro para cuando lo necesiten urgentemente tengan de donde tomar ya que su esposos y ella son personas mayores de edad y no pueden conseguir trabajo f\u00e1cilmente.\nElla est\u00e1 muy agradecida porque gracias al cr\u00e9dito ha podido comprar varios animales y siempre ha tratado de ahorra y cuando puede darse un gustito n comprar cosas que necesita lo hace como comprarse zapatos nuevos, rebosos, etc.\nDo\u00f1a Olga y las integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy contentas y agradecidas con FRAC y KIVA ya que podr\u00e1n invertir en sus actividades Trinidad y Carmen compraran borregos, y Beatriz comprar pollos. \n","en":"The group \u201cLibertad\u201d (Freedom) consists of four cheerful and hardworking women who always enjoy succeeding at everything.  They chose the name of the group because they believe their country is free of slavery.  Apparently Do\u00f1a Olga had the idea of what slavery was like in Mexico.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Olga is the group representative.  She says that she is 58 years old and has been married to Sr. Pablo for 34 years.  At the moment, they do not have any dependent children.  They all live in San Pablo Tlachichilpa, a place where the people are friendly and hardworking.  Do\u00f1a Olga raises and sells animals.  She is requesting a loan in order to buy sheep, chickens, and corn in large quantities because she knows that the prices have increased.  She has already been in business for 30 years.  When she was a young girl, her parents were in the same line of work.  Her parents would take their animals out to pasture, but times have changed since there is no place for her animals to graze.  Therefore, she must buy food for her animals such as grasses, ground corn, and other types of feed.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Olga\u2019s greatest challenge is when her animals get sick because she does not have the resources to cover veterinary expenses and medicines.  Each month she has to buy a powdered remedy for her chickens and also have her sheep checked for parasites.  Her goal is to have savings set aside for emergencies.  She and her husband are older, so they are not able to continue working as easily as before.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Olga is very grateful because the loans have enabled her to buy several animals.  She always tries to save, but whenever she is able to treat herself, she buys things that she needs such as new shoes, shawls, and other items.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations.

It is a very quiet location known for its nopal (prickly cactus) plantations, from which it gets the name \"La Nopalera\".\r\n\r\nElias is the group's representative.  He tells us that he is 43 years old and married to Teresa.  They have been together for 20 years and have five children who are in school.  Therefore, Elias works hard because his concerned about his children's well-being.  He has been growing \"nopals\" for 12 years, although the idea for the business came from his wife Teresa.  This time he is requesting a loan to buy organic fertilizer called manure.  He says he likes to grow \"nopales\" even though one must be careful when planting them so as not to break the rack, and also in protecting them from the red spider plague, which turns the nopal red and keeps it from producing.    Although this may sound a little alarming for us, Elias says that is not the case since he knows what to do to avoid it.  Elias' biggest problem is money, since he does not have as much to invest as he would like in his nopal crop.  He wants to plant more land and put a structure over his plantation.\r\n\r\nElias' goal is to improve his nopal production and quality.  He is grateful for the loan which has allowed him to increase crop volume, so he not only sells normal nopals, but also as a fruit drink, along with tortilla.  He is using his profits to pay for his children's education, clothing, food and shoes for the entire family.  In general, the entire group is very grateful for the loan, since all the members will be able to buy what they need.

is married and has four children. She lives in Travelers, Bamenda, Northwest region, Cameroon. She lives with the entire family in a three-bedroom house.\r\n\r\nThe loss of her father and elder sister was one of the most difficult moments in her life, which brought general poverty to the family, causing her to drop out of school, thus making dependence on her too much. She also has faced the difficulty of educating the family members.   \r\n\r\nGlory has benefited from loans from GHAPE four times and this will be the fifth time she is benefiting from a loan from GHAPE. Glory has been in GHAPE since 2005 and has been very successful in past businesses. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use her loan in the purchase and resale of firewood, the production and sale of yogurt, and poultry and piggery farming. She thinks this  business will succeed because she has so many customers and also because of the ever-increasing demand for these products.   \r\n\r\nShe intends to use the proceeds of this business to pay her children's school fees, buy some basic needs for the family, build her house and solve some of her family's problems.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach for People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She has been with VisionFund since 2011 and has completely and regularly repaid all her obligations to VisionFund. She is now requesting a third loan and acts as a leader of a loan group of four members, all of whom are female.

is 32 years old and lives in the town of Arua in the Arua region of Uganda. She is married and has five children, all currently in school. For the past 10 years, Lucy has been working hard to manage her small business selling small dry fish. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Lucy has requested a loan of 3,000,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog. These are the profits that dealers make as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 6000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 31,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosalinda hopes to grow her business and increase her clients in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan.

Margarito delivers all of his coffee to a distributing center in the community where he lives so it can be sent later to the \"Huatusco Regional Union\" which exports it. Margarito would like to give his children a better quality of life, especially because two of his children have different capacities and the community they live in doesn't have the facilities to serve them. In the future he would also like to open a store in his house and he knows that working with coffee like he has so far has made it possible to achieve all of this.

They live in a city about two hours drive from Jakarta. Their kiosk name is Yuli Cell. The kiosk is named after his wife, because most of the time Yuli is the one that runs the business and waits for customers. Yuli Cell is not the only income they generate for the family, because Sumaryadi himself is an employee. Although Yuli is the one who runs the business, the working capital comes from Sumaryadi. And for Loket Ruma, Sumaryadi will be the one that runs the business with a little help from Yuli. Sumaryadi's family has two children,  aged 10 and 4. \r\n\r\nThe reason why Sumaryadi decided to become a Loket Ruma agent is because he really wants to expand his business. Currently, most of the items Sumaryadi and his wife sell are airtime from all mobile phone providers in Indonesia and starter packs for mobile phone sim cards. They have also started to sell funny stickers (stickers with jokes, funny icons, proverbs, etc.) and cheap perfumes. \r\n\r\nBeing an agent for Loket Ruma means that Sumaryadi will grow his business and become a payment point for bill payment. This loan will serve as a damage deposit for the electronic data capture (EDC) device that as an agent, Sumaryadi will use to enter payments and print receipts for his customers. He is expecting people will use the service to pay monthly installments for things such as cars, motorcycles, and housing. Also, he believes people will come to his kiosk to pay their water and electricity bills, both for prepaid and postpaid electricity bills. \r\n\r\nBasically, he sees this new business program from Ruma as an opportunity that he can take to generate more income. He wants Yuli Cell to be profitable and to be a success in the near future. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1084322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for a deposit on an electronic data capture (EDC) terminal for a bill payment business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T02:00:05Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumaryadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":3000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3213679.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172420,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-11T18:17:23Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T15:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":423818,"name":"Mageret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mageret cooks and sells kenkey (fermented corn dough wrapped in corn or banana leaves).

She mainly offers rugs, from round, palm-sized ones to the much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLigaya hopes to increase production and dreams of being able to give her family a good life through all her hard work on her business.

hardworking indigenous women.  They are originally from a small town called San Juan Cacahuatepec, which is better known as Cacahuate.  One of the traditions of this community is \"La Danza de Las Mascaritas\" (The Dance of the Little Masks), which is performed on the date of the Carnival celebration. \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of this group is Sra. Luz Maria.  She is 30 years old and known as a cheerful, friendly, and respectful woman.  Do\u00f1a Luz is best known among her fellow group members for selling seafood, which she has done for four years.  The seafood she sells includes tilapia, sea bass, snapper, and mussels.  She also sells fillets and shrimp upon request.  Luz is happily married to Sr. Jes\u00fas, a hardworking and friendly gentleman who grows corn and works as a bricklayer.  They have a son named Jose Antonio, who she says is her motivation to work every day and get stronger.  What she enjoys most about her business is being able to sell fish in neighboring towns and talking with the residents.

He lives in his own home with his wife and children.  He says that in his community people live at a subsistence standard of living.  Most of the residents are self-employed and work in retail trade and raising small animals. Also, some of them are farmers.  Anibal lives in the Sinchi Roca settlement in the Tambogrande district, in the department of Piura.  Here the only utility is electricity; he gets his water from a communal tank.  In this place, all of the families live under these conditions.\r\n\r\nAnibal has a business raising and selling pigs, sheep and poultry (10 sheep, 10 pigs and 20 chickens).  He raises these animals in corrals that are outside his home.  It should be noted that Anibal has 2 years of experience in this line of work, and this has enabled him to maintain a well-established customer base.  He sells his animals to the wholesale traders in the area.  Also, his wife has a farm where she has half a hectare planted with lemons.  These are growing well and so will generate some extra income.\r\n\r\nNow Anibal has proposed to expand his inventory of animals, because this is a very profitable business in this area.  For this reason he is requesting a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa for a sum of 1,500 Peruvian soles, which will allow him to invest in the purchase of balanced animal feed and fertilizers for his lemon crop.  Over time, this will allow him to improve his standard of living. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1086471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy animal feed and fertilizers for his crops\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T03:10:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anibal Gerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":101.65},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":109.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":111.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":112.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":122.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":130.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":133.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":139.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":144.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":147.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.04,"local_amount":211.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":213.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423769,"comment":null},{"amount":42.85,"local_amount":111.8,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":113.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317188,"comment":null},{"amount":43.24,"local_amount":112.8,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":114.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374007,"comment":null},{"amount":45.62,"local_amount":119,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":120.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385251,"comment":null},{"amount":47.09,"local_amount":122.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":124.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368845,"comment":null},{"amount":48.26,"local_amount":125.9,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":127.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977891,"comment":null},{"amount":50.18,"local_amount":130.9,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":132.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115080,"comment":null},{"amount":51.1,"local_amount":133.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":134.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506756,"comment":null},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":139.85,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":141.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058709,"comment":null},{"amount":112.01,"local_amount":292.2,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":295.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804272,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T12:44:13Z","paid_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":423836,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is 45 years old and lives in Bardnersville.

Because he has been concerned with producing the best quality coffee, he and his wife have chosen to produce organically, without using chemical fertilizers.  This is also good for the environment.  In previous years they have had harvests of about 16 tons per year, but for a number of reasons things have not gone well lately, and this year they only managed to produce 5 tons.

This is her story:\r\n\r\nI am Lydia, the second born in a family of three. I have one parent, my mother, and two siblings. My father died nine years ago. My mother is a housewife and also takes care of a few goats and sheep. None of my siblings got a chance to go to school.\r\n\r\nI am from Lodwar in Turkana County. Turkana, in the northern part of Kenya, is a famine-ravaged region and most girls never get to see the inside of a classroom. Most parents prefer to send a boy to school over a girl, because they believe the female will be married off. Some girls are married off by their relatives even at the age of 12 years. I am one of the few lucky girls who went to school.\r\n\r\nI completed my primary school education in the year 2007 and proceeded to high school in Turkana. My school fees for high school were paid by my local Catholic parish in Lodwar. I managed to attain a mean grade of B+ in my final high school examination. In my family and village, I am the only one who is educated to secondary school level and this motivates me to put more effort into my studies in order to uplift my family and community at large.\r\n\r\nI am happy to apply for this loan to study for a Bachelor of Commerce degree at Strathmore University. Strathmore is my top choice because of its high quality education and facilities. Given this chance by Kiva, my higher education will be easily achieved. Thanks to God for this opportunity.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of challenges that I have faced, but normally I encourage myself by saying, \"What matters in life is not really where I am now, but rather the direction I am heading.\" I will never allow my past experiences to compromise the quality of my future.

They have four children, all of whom attend school.  Do\u00f1a Carmen, as she is commonly known by everyone in her community, has a grocery store that she started two years ago so that she could help her husband cover the household expenses.  At the moment, her store does not have a name.  She is requesting a loan to buy canned goods, bread, milk, eggs, fried snacks, and detergents.  \"More than ever, my store is lacking inventory,\" she says.  Do\u00f1a Carmen's greatest challenge is the lack of customers because there are few homes where her store is located.  However, she is hopeful that some day more people will settle here and that her earnings will increase.  Carmen also has problems with the high prices charged by her suppliers, so her profits are not at the level she would like.  During the time she has worked with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, Carmen started out working with a large group, but now she has completed two loan cycles by herself.  \"The loans have been a great benefit.  As a result, I have been able to restock my store.  Using the profits that were generated, my husband was able to buy a compressor for automobiles,\" says Carmen.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Carmen and her husband Carlos have plans to open a car wash.  This will allow her to spend more time at home with the family so that she does not have to leave the house in order to earn a living.

The economic situation in their region is very difficult, so they all have to help out the family finances. Things didn't go very well for Felipe and his family during the past harvest, so they only produced three tons, meaning they also had to work for other people because the income they earned from their coffee wasn't enough. The coffee they produce is as much organic as it is conventional, however they want all their production to be organic because it gets a better price at market, and for this they need a loan to plant new crops and buy fertilizers, since this process takes about two to three years.

When he turned 22 he became independent and began working on his own farmland with his wife Roc\u00edo.  They have four children who also currently work in coffee production.  Miguel also grows banana leaves for shade on his plantation.  They are in high demand in the food making business, so this activity generates extra income.  \r\n\r\nDuring the last harvest, Miguel and his family reached a production of 13 tons.  His 4-year plan is to reach a total 20 tons, since he has already planted 2,000 new seedlings which will take that long to start producing coffee.  Therefore, Miguel is in need of a loan to buy fertilizer for his land.  In addition to increasing coffee production, another goal Miguel has for himself and his children is to begin raising cattle.

He is the light of her life and, most of all, he is the motivating force which propels her onwards each day. Her home is located in the city of Pisco, a city which is characterised by its warm climate and tourist attractions, such as the Ballesta Islands and the Candelabra Geoglyph. In her free time, Carina enjoys walking with her son and taking the opportunity to savour her favourite local food, the incredibly tasty \"Cau Cau\" (a stew made from beef, tripe and potatoes). She has completed her secondary school studies but she would have liked to continue to study Tourism and Hospitality.\r\n\r\nEach day Carina works with great enthusiasm at her market stall, which is a type of shop selling a diverse range of products such as gifts, personal hygiene products and wigs, among other items. She dedicates herself to her business for around 10 hours each day and she sees up to 30 clients on a daily basis. She believes that the reason her business is going well is because she is pleasant to her customers and she is located in a central spot.\r\n\r\nCarina is very grateful to the Kiva lenders as, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business such as wigs, beauty products and toys among other items, which will enable her to have more stock to offer to her customers and to improve her income. Consequently, she will be able to continue working towards realising her greatest dream: To provide her son with a good education and to study for a university degree.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1085953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

She says that all the families in this district live under these conditions.  \r\n\r\nThe work through which Mar\u00eda makes a living is the purchase and sale of vegetables, which she sells in a stall in the market of M\u00f3rrope, where she is doing well with the business.  She also makes a living raising and fattening up goats and poultry, generating more income to cover her own costs.  It is worth noting that Mar\u00eda has had two years of experience in this work, which has allowed her to keep her already established customers in this business.  Likewise, her partner also supports her in this work.\r\n\r\nNow, Mar\u00eda is asking for a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa for an amount of 2000 nuevos soles that will be used for working capital (to buy vegetables) and to arrange her pens. This is because it is a very profitable activity in the area, and which in time will allow her to go on improving her standard of living with her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1086582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy vegetables to stock up her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T16:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T16:00:09Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eca Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":144.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":149.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":157.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":161.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":170.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":174.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":178.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":185.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":192.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":195.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":282.25,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":288.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423773,"comment":null},{"amount":57.76,"local_amount":149.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":152.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317192,"comment":null},{"amount":58.96,"local_amount":152.15,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":155.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374011,"comment":null},{"amount":60.93,"local_amount":157.25,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":160.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385254,"comment":null},{"amount":62.45,"local_amount":161.15,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":164.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368848,"comment":null},{"amount":65.97,"local_amount":170.25,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":174.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977894,"comment":null},{"amount":67.66,"local_amount":174.6,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":178.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115083,"comment":null},{"amount":69.2,"local_amount":178.6,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":182.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506759,"comment":null},{"amount":72.06,"local_amount":185.95,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":190.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058712,"comment":null},{"amount":150.64,"local_amount":388.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":397.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804275,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-10T14:56:45Z","paid_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":424106,"name":"Sophors","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophors is 36 years old, married, and has three children who attend school.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nSylvia operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small quantities to residents of the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil or an egg.  She earns money by acquiring supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 50,000 PHP. She will use this loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory.  She expects an increase in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSylvia hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

is Alicia, 58, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is a widow and a mother to her two children. She, together with her children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAlicia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells cooked viands for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAlicia dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1091373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMerlinda operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small quantities to residents of the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil or an egg.  She earns money by acquiring supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 16,000 PHP. She will use this loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  She expects an increase in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMerlinda hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.  She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and\/or clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1091331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products to stock in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T18:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T18:10:12Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":186.67,"local_amount":7467,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7917.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095742,"comment":null},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4266,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4523.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359353,"comment":null},{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4267,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4524.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303168,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-12T17:10:25Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":424142,"name":"Tima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tima is a married woman with no children.
