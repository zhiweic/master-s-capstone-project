lives in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County, which is noted for producing fish. He is 35 years old, and a junior high school dropout. He described himself as a studious and focused person. He is married and his wife sells clothes as well. They have four children between the ages of 5 and 14 who are in school and live at home. Enoch has been running a shop since 2004 where he sells cosmetics, fashion clothing such as T-shirt, blouses, jeans, and trousers. He sells six days a week from 7AM to 6PM. He likes his business because his business keeps him busy. He started this business after selling for his sister years ago. He uses a shared bus to enable him to get his goods to his shop.

Therefore, she did not manage to have good sales during the day.  This often discouraged her.  Nonetheless, she was, little by little, getting things in place in her small sales stand.  Now she sells a lot more than before.  What she likes most about her work is the happy moments of exchange with her customers, talking with them, and seeing them start the day with a smile.

She was born in an agricultural area that has good conditions for raising livestock and growing crops.  Dilnoza's family was poor and she helped her parents since childhood with raising livestock and growing crops.  Dilnoza herself has had a lot of hardships in life, because she lived in a poor family.  After finishing high school, Dilnoza married a livestock breeder and helped her husband raise livestock and grow crops.  They mostly raised livestock, purchasing livestock at the market at a low price, fattening it for a period of time and selling it at a high price.  Because of unfortunate weather and climate their business did not have positive returns.  Because of this, Dilnoza's husband plans to travel to earn money in the Russian Federation.  This is why Dilnoza turned to our organization for a loan for the purchase of a plane ticket for her husband; she plans to continue raising livestock.  Dilnoza hopes for your charity and mercy.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1353519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer

Jenny's business is selling creole dishes such as chicken stew, barbecued chicken, 'adobo de res' (beef stew with rice and beans) etc.  Her business is located just outside her home and she has been running it for 12 years.  She says that she started out in this business when her friend had an idea and suggested that they work together making delicious meals.  They are still working together now.  Jenny considers her business to be profitable because where she lives there are a number of workers who she provides her meal service to as they don't have enough time to cook at home.  The problem that she faced when she started her business was a lack of capital with which to buy tables, chairs and supplies for preparing her different meals.  However, she and her friend gradually got together enough money to buy everything they needed.\r\n\r\nJenny hopes to continue growing her business and would like to build comfortable business premises where she can serve the people who come to buy her delicious dishes.

is 49-year-old Kadiatu. She is married and has 3 children, ages 31, 27 and 21. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Kadiatu established her motor vehicle spare parts business. She began her business because there was no one to take care of her schooling. Working 7 days a week and 9 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nKadiatu would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000 in order to buy more spare parts for her business, like oil filters, clutch plates and engine oil.

She has been selling clothing for one year.  Before she met her husband, Roxana was studying but she got pregnant and had to leave school.  Her mother-in-law encouraged her to set up a small general store so that she could make income to contribute towards the household expenses.  She currently also has a small grocery store.  Roxana feels very satisfied as she has her own business and doesn't have to neglect her daughter.  She gets up at 4.30am to do her housework and then works in her business.  She buys her merchandise in two large cities.  The journey she makes, by bus, is one and a half hours long.  Before she can catch the bus, she has a ten minute walk.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that Roxana is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will be used to buy two dozen pairs of women's trousers, two dozen blouses, eight dozen pairs of women's underpants in different styles, two dozen pairs of men's trousers, three dozen t-shirts, one dozen men's dress shirts and men's underwear.  This will allow her to increase the range of merchandise she offers her customers and the amount she has available.  She hopes to increase her sales and income so that she can save up and pay back her loan.  Roxana's dream is to graduate from university as a teacher (she is currently studying on Saturdays).

He lives in a small village in Zestaponi District with his wife and two infant children. Eldar requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were always rejected, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese production. They sell cheese at local markets. Besides that, they have a one-hectare plot of land where maize is grown. It barely provides enough food for the family. According to Credo\u2019s evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Eldar applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Eldar will buy a minibus. After buying the minibus, he will begin trading in calves. He will buy calves at a good price and then transport them to resell at higher prices in different villages. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Del Oratorio Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Last year in a rural area outside Totonicapan, Guatemala, a new Trust Bank, \u201cMujeres del Oratorio\u201d was formed. The group consists of 13 women who have an average age of 29 years. Their average level of education is five years. The women are engaged in different businesses such as the sale of fruits, vegetables and water. One of the members owns her own bakery and sells bread daily. \r\n\r\nBrenda is a 20-year-old member of the Trust Bank. She works with her mother selling tortillas, fruit and water. They have a small storefront in a busy part of town. This works to their advantage, as many in the heavily traveled area patronize their small storefront.\r\n\r\nBrenda is an ambitious young woman with a great desire to excel. She multi-tasks each day, getting up early to attend to her business. In the afternoon, she attends the local high school where she is a senior. Brenda looks forward to graduation later this year.\r\n\r\nBrenda is currently requesting a loan with Friendship Bridge, which she will use to purchase more products that she can sell in her business. Her earnings will help Brenda meet her own educational needs as well as those of her three siblings! She will work diligently in her business because she realizes how valuable a loan is and how difficult it is to get credit anywhere else. Brenda tells us how fortunate she feels to have this working capital to invest in her business. Her great dream is to finish high school and then go to college. She is well aware of how important an education is and how her future depends on it.\r\n\r\nBoth Brenda and the other 12 women in the group are very excited to get these loans from Kiva investors and Friendship Bridge for their businesses. They expressed their gratitude to all in every area of the world who are providing this opportunity for them. They look forward to a brighter future for themselves, their families and their community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3459.44,"image":{"id":1356143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase inventory of tortillas, fruit and water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Cristobal Totonicapan ","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-05-23T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-22T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Yaneth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Rosmeri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Yasmini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio Natali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Nicolasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Hilse ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aracely Noemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amalia Susana  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Glenda Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brenda Karina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sucelly Emperatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":33200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4154.8},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4154.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4154.8},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4154.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4154.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4154.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4154.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4116.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":535},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":535},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":534.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":534.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":530.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":534.99,"local_amount":4154.8,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4171.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701768,"comment":null},{"amount":535,"local_amount":4154.8,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4171.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564173,"comment":null},{"amount":534.99,"local_amount":4154.8,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:20:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4171.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813230,"comment":null},{"amount":437.52,"local_amount":3397.8,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3411.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089100,"comment":null},{"amount":270.25,"local_amount":2098.8,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2107.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855069,"comment":null},{"amount":668.13,"local_amount":5188.77,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5209.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503405,"comment":null},{"amount":478.56,"local_amount":3716.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3731.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728389,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-24T18:13:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":562773,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is 62 years old and married.

Their average age is 35 years.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank is led by a Board of Directors who have elected Margarita as their President. She tells us that she has been associated with Friendship Bridge for the past four years. \r\n\r\nMargarita is 38 years old and married. She is quite proud that her previous loans have enabled her to earn enough to support her entire family. She is especially pleased that her children are able to attend school. Her oldest daughter graduated from high school two years ago where she studied medicine. As she has not been able to secure a job in the medical field, she has been helping Margarita with her textile business. Margarita dreams of sending her daughter to college in the coming year.\r\n\r\nMargarita is requesting a new loan to buy supplies, including thread, for her weaving business. She will work with her daughter to meet the demands of her customers and perhaps expand the business. There is enough money to pay for the household expenses. Both mother and daughter want to save some funds and open a pharmacy in her home or nearby.\r\n\r\nMargarita and her fellow Trust Bank members enjoy the informative and useful training programs given by Friendship Bridge each month. They learn about timely and useful topics that help them in their daily lives, including effective business practices, health and family issues and self-esteem. The women cherish their time together, hearing of the progress that each is making in her life. They are happy and thankful to receive a loan and express their gratitude to Kiva investors and Friendship Bridge.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2104.2,"image":{"id":1356130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy supplies, including thread, for her weaving business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicapan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -91.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-05-23T18:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-22T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe Lorenza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Celestina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2338},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2282}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300.6,"local_amount":2338,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2343.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701767,"comment":null},{"amount":300.6,"local_amount":2338,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2343.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564172,"comment":null},{"amount":300.6,"local_amount":2338,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2343.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813229,"comment":null},{"amount":300.6,"local_amount":2338,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2343.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089099,"comment":null},{"amount":300.6,"local_amount":2338,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2343.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855068,"comment":null},{"amount":300.6,"local_amount":2338,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2343.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503404,"comment":null},{"amount":300.6,"local_amount":2338,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2343.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728388,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-24T01:37:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":562692,"name":"Nora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nora is 40 years old, married, and has two children.
