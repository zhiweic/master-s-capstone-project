So, she decided to start a business trading clothing with the help of a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Her credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo - Start-up Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.

She is aiming to grow her business and increase her profits.\r\n\r\nThe story of Sara and her sewing business is just one of the many examples of Izdiharona's work for economic development clients.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":340,"image":{"id":1443388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a sewing machine and fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":321,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T13:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T13:10:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":174,"local_amount":174,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":174,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880257,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429528874,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753035,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-09T08:41:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":614723,"name":"Felecien","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felecien is 62 years old.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1443415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy more fertilizers for use during maize production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Euphrasie\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":867421,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":867421}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T19:49:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":614742,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha is 41 years old, married, and lives in Margibi County with her five children, who are between the ages of 15 to 30.

is 34 years old. He is a father of three children. His wife works as a farmer. \r\n\r\nHe will use the Kiva loan to buy fertilizer during maize production. They need to buy fertilizer in order to increase their production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing, as well as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. Susanna and her family will be very thankful to the lenders for their good will in helping them collect the needed loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":96,"image":{"id":1443459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Tungalag, 41 years old, lives with her parents and sisters in an old house on a plot of land in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nShe has been working in a textile factory since 2012. Her husband works in Korea on an employment contract. Her parents both have retired from work and get state pension. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and it needs some serious repair.

Each member carries out an economic activity with the objective of earning their own money and offering their family a better quality of life. This group is located in a neighbourhood where the main economic activities are trade and ranching. \r\n\r\nLeticia is one of the members; she says that she joined this group because she wanted to have the opportunity to receive a loan and start working in her own business and therefore have an extra source of money. Leticia works in trade, selling bedclothes, table cloths and curtains. She says that favoured this business because it earns good profits and the competition is low, which increases her chance of sales. \r\n\r\nNormally, she offers her products by making house calls to her friends and neighbours in the neighbourhood of her municipality. Because she now has two years' experience, on occasions people look her out and make orders. She is very happy with her business because it isn't just her source of income, but it has also helped her improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nA loan from VisionFund and Kiva will help her to invest in buying sheets, blankets, duvets, bedspreads, curtains and tablecloths to continue with her sales. \r\n\r\nLeticia mentioned that she would like to spend her profits on buying a wardrobe and on continuing to invest in her business. \r\n\r\nThe other members are:\r\nMaribel selling food \r\nRoxana selling cosmetics\r\nAlicia selling cheese, tortilla chips and tortillas\r\nTeresa selling household articles\r\nYolanda selling perfumes\r\nJulia selling perfumes\r\nTom\u00e1s selling newspapers\r\nJos\u00e9 Antonio selling meat\r\nLiliana selling cosmetics \r\nMar\u00eda Eugenia selling soft drinks\r\nLeticia M. selling tacos \r\nVer\u00f3nica selling cosmetics"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5800,"image":{"id":1436495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy sheets, blankets, duvets, bedspreads, curtains and tablecloths.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca, Ver.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":5800,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tom\u00e1s ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":76000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":5800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":9500},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":9500},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":9500},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9500},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9500},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":9500},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9500},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":9500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2900,"local_amount":38000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:37Z","rounded_local_amount":38119.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991838,"comment":null},{"amount":1450,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":19059.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644486,"comment":null},{"amount":1450,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":19059.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877947,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-09T01:10:03Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":617673,"name":"Sebastian Pantaleon","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Sebasti\u00e1n, habitante del departamento de  Juigalpa Chontales, tiene una hija en edad escolar y  su mayor deseo es que estudie una carrera profesional.

Now she has formed a group of three members to take out a new loan and she is the group leader. She and her group members are applying for a loan amount of 1,400,000 KHR each.

Asylkan has a university education.  The primary income to her family comes from Asylkan's cattle raising business, which she started 25 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 400 KGS.  Thanks to Asylkan's hard work, her farm currently has 6 milking cows, one horse and 10 goats.

This area is very well known for selling dry grains.  Magola's divorced and has a son, 21, who's already married and lives in the city of Latacunga.  He visits his mother every day.\r\n\r\nMagola makes a living selling fruit in the market in Sigchos, an area away from the city.  She learned this business from her mother, who did this work her entire life and Magola inherited it from her.  She goes to market on Monday and Sunday; the rest of the week she stays at home taking care of small animals such as chickens, guinea pigs, and pigs.\r\n\r\nShe has to go out and work because of her financial situation, as she doesn't have the support of her son's father.  She worked in the field with her parents from a very young age.  Now Magola takes care of her mother because her father died.\r\n\r\nMagola's requesting the loan to invest in fruits and vegetables because her customers have asked for variety.  She has a lot of demand because this is a commercial area.  It's difficult for her right now to transport her products, which is why she can't go more often to sell her products.  With the income from her small animals, though, she has been able to get ahead and pay for her own necessities and those of her mother, who's a senior citizen.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to be healthy and have a job so she can keep on taking care of her mother, who doesn't have anyone else.\r\n\r\nMagola wants to extend her sincere thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for this opportunity to be able to grow her business and improve her quality of

financial support.  Her name is Marvorid.  She is 24 years old, married and is raising two children.  Marvorid lives in the countryside, which offers her a great opportunity to expand her business of raising cattle.  She has been working in this field for more than a year.

He was a jeweler and worked at his craft day and night. I was curious about it but didn't really give it much attention. As an adult, I'd go to the mountains to trade scales for grams of gold.  And this is how I became enthused about jewelry.  One day, I stayed watching my father and he suggested I pay close attention to what he was doing. In this way, I began to learn each detail of every piece.  I never attended workshops or courses, as my father was my teacher, although he never gave me a formal class. I learned myself by observing, and never let a single detail get past me.  These days I get up at night to sit and design quietly.\"\n\nA message from Carlos: \"First of all, please receive a big hug for your support through this microcredit.

El nombre del grupo lo eligieron ellos mismos porque es un nombre b\u00edblico, as\u00ed se llam\u00f3 el lugar donde Ad\u00e1n y Eva viv\u00edan.\n\nDo\u00f1a Adoraci\u00f3n o Dora, como le dicen de cari\u00f1o, es la representante del grupo, tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Armando; juntos han formado una familia con una hija que se encuentra estudiando. Do\u00f1a Dora se dedica a la cr\u00eda y venta de cerdos desde hace ya seis a\u00f1os platica como fue que inicio su negocio \u201cLa cr\u00eda de los cerdos la inicie por necesidad, tambi\u00e9n por la falta de un trabajo estable, las saudas o las estructuras para iniciar con la cr\u00eda de mis cerdos ya estaban porque eran de mis padres\". Los padres de Dora tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a esta actividad. Do\u00f1a Dora solo cr\u00eda y engorda sus lechoncitos para despu\u00e9s venderlos mientras que a unas cuantas cerdas las utiliza solo para pie cr\u00eda cuando estas dan sus  a luz a sus cerditos de inmediato inicia  a buscar su comprador en muchas ocasiones es muy dif\u00edcil encontrar personas que desean adquirir un lechoncito. Do\u00f1a Dora adem\u00e1s de estar ofreciendo sus lechones con sus vecinos tambi\u00e9n coloca un letrero afuera de su casa con la leyenda \u201cSe venden lechones\u201d. Esta situaci\u00f3n es la dificultad de Dora, es decir, poder encontrar un buen comprador. Ella tiene una amplia experiencia en cerdos porque desde muy chica se vio involucrada en esta actividad. Sus cerdas solo pueden llegar a tener seis o siete lechoncitos en cada camada. Al momento de quedar cargada la cerda se esperan cuatro meses es un periodo de gestaci\u00f3n, los lechones nacen y por cuarenta d\u00edas Do\u00f1a Dora tiene que tener un cuidado especial con ellos, pasando este tiempo ya puede venderlos. Aunque de ante mano sabe cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 la dificultadad para vender sus lechones, ella est\u00e1 muy motivada a seguir con su actividad \u201cNo hay de otra m\u00e1s que seguir ech\u00e1ndole ganas, me gustar\u00eda hacer crecer mi negocio tengo las estructuras necesarias para tener los suficientes lechones pero en la comunidad hay muchos vecinos dedicados a la cr\u00eda y venta de cerdos as\u00ed no puedo vender ya con mucha facilidad\u201d. Sin embargo la meta de Do\u00f1a Dora es ver realizado el sue\u00f1o de su hija que quiere llegar a ser  un medico cirujano. Esta profesi\u00f3n le naci\u00f3 desde peque\u00f1a porque siempre sus abuelos eran muy enfermizos, siempre deseo poder ayudar a mejorar su condici\u00f3n. Los miembros del grupo son Wilebaldo quien invertir\u00e1 en la venta de jarciar\u00eda; \u00c1lvaro, en la cr\u00eda, engorda y venta de pollos y guajolotes; Jos\u00e9, en la venta de fibras y Rosario, en la cr\u00eda y engorda de cerdos. Ellos est\u00e1n muy agradecidos por la oportunidad de recibir un pr\u00e9stamo fondeado por personas de diferentes partes del mundo, adem\u00e1s porque llevan ya dos a\u00f1os en VFM y ya han visto las mejor\u00eda en sus actividades.","en":"The group \u201cEden\u201d is composed of five people, both men and women. All of them are very good friends and unconditional support exists among them. They chose their name themselves from the biblical name, calling it after the place where Adam and Eve lived.\n\nAdoraci\u00f3n, or Dora as she is affectionately called, is the representative of the group. She is 40 years old and married to Armando. They have a daughter who is studying. Dora has been raising and selling pigs for six years saying about starting her business, \u201cBreeding pigs was a necessity because of the lack of stable work and the inclination and framework were already there from my parents to begin raising pigs.\u201d Dora\u2019s parents also work in this field. Dora breeds and fattens some of her piglets to sell later while some of the other pigs are only used for breeding and she starts looking for buyers right away as many times it is hard to find people wanting to buy a piglet.\n\nDora also offers her piglets through her neighbors placing a sign outside their house reading, \u201cPiglets for sale\u201d. This situation is difficult for Dora, that is to say, finding a good buyer. She has extensive experience in pigs because since she was a young girl she has been involved in this business. \n\nHer pigs can only have six or seven piglets in each litter. From the moment of conception they have a four month period of gestation, then the piglets are born and for forty days Dora has to be especially careful with them, waiting for the time when she can sell them. Although she knows before hand that it will be difficult to sell her piglets, she is very motivated to continue working in this field. \u201cThere is no other option than to continue going forward. I would like to grow my business. I have the necessary structures in place to have enough piglets but in the community there are many neighbors growing and selling pigs so I can\u2019t sell them easily.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dora\u2019s goal is to see her daughter become a surgeon. This professional desire has been there since childhood because her grandparents were always ailing, and she always wanted to help them get better.\n\nThe members of the group are Wilebaldo who will invest by selling rigging ropes; \u00c1lvaro who raises, fattens and sells chickens and turkeys; Jos\u00e9 sells fibers, and Rosario raises and fattens pigs. They are very grateful for the opportunity of receiving a loan funded by people from different parts of the world, and because they have been with VisionFund Mexico for two years they have already seen their activities improve.

She would like to invest in the purchase of more silver, jade and tools so she can develop her new designs.\n\nZandra has been selling through NOVICA since 2011. This is her story:\n\n\"The first thing I ever made on my own was a pair of silver earrings. My husband taught me so I could help him. I remember watching him work on his own 'til all hours of the night and I really wanted to learn how to craft jewelry. Finally the day came when he asked me to help him and that's how I started. As I saw the jewelry I had been crafting and saw how beautiful it was. It's not been easy getting established as an artisan because silver is very expensive and it's difficult to purchase. But when you set your own mind to it, you can achieve your goals. My greatest dream is to be able to buy a piece of land and build my own house so that I may leave it to my two sons.\n\nI like to work with jade because it is a sacred stone for us Maya people. Jade used to be worn as an amulet, and those who wore the most jade pieces were considered to be the most important people in the community. Rescuing the value of our traditions is always important.\n\nSilver has become a way of life for my family, and little by little I'm teaching my sons so that when they grow up they may choose to continue what their mom and dad began for them. Guatemala offers many opportunities for those of us who like to work hard and now my husband and I have a workshop where we also sell our designs. I strongly believe that everything is possible if one has dreams, and that nothing is impossible if you work hard to achieve your goals.\"\n\nA message from Zandra: \"I have many new ideas in mind for new jewelry pieces, but I need some special tools to be able to make them. I would also like to prepare a good stock in time for the holiday season. That's why I would like to thank you so much for your support through this microcredit.

His wife is working in a municipality and sometimes helps her husband when she has free time. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Milorad  generates income also by planting wheat and corn and working on the land for other people in the area where he lives. Now he is in need of a loan to pay for a new tractor. The loan will help him to expand and improve his business and generate more income. He hopes that, in this way, he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family. He thanks all of the Kiva lenders."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":233.74,"image":{"id":1443947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a new tractor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"XK","country":"Kosovo","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42.583333 21","type":"point"}},"partner_id":240,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milorad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"EUR","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":49},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":58},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":59},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":114.12,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-20T10:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":84.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420424981,"comment":null},{"amount":119.62,"local_amount":87,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":88.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439765119,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T04:05:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615085,"name":"Leutrim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leutrim is 22 years old and a happily married father of a 1-year-old son, living in the southern part of Kosovo.

She also has her own farm.  Batima has a secondary-specialized education, and works as an accountant in a local hospital.  Beginning 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5000 KGS, Batima's engagement in animal husbandry has been the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to the hard work of Batima, she now has: 1 milk cow, 1 calf, and 7 sheep.  Her monthly earnings are 10,000 KGS.  With the goal of further developing her herd, Batima turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 40,000 KGS in order to purchase cows for breeding.  With the earnings from her loan Batima plans to continue to increase her numbers of cattle and also plans to save funds to repair her home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1447331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kumaryk village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T18:57:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615096,"name":"Kalssom's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kalssom belongs to an ultra-poor family and has been feeding her seven children.

Kakamega county is located in Western Kenya and is famous for having the only tropical rain forest in the country. Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas, and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping. \r\n\r\nPeter is married and has one child. Peter works as a carpenter, while his wife is a businesswoman. When he and his wife are not working, they farm their land. They are currently growing sugarcane, maize, and vegetables on their plot. He was interested in starting beekeeping because it is not an expensive activity, and because you harvest more than once per year, it is a good source of income. \r\n\r\nThis is Peter\u2019s first loan with Kiva, and he plans to use the income from his beehives to start a savings fund to \u201cpay primary school, secondary school and college fees for my children.\u201d When asked about his hopes for the future, Peter had a very specific answer: he wants to \u201cbuy more land, buy a motorbike and do business with it, see my children through school, own a powersaw for business of cutting timber, live a better life with my family, and expand my carpentry business.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy beehives for honey production.
