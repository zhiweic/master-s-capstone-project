Currently, he is separated from the woman he had been with for a year and with whom he had a daughter, who is now 1 year and 2 months.

He has worked at this for 13 years in the car that his friend lends him.  He drives around the streets of the city with the goal of looking for passengers, and thanks to his skills as a good conversationalist and because of his joyful spirit, he has loyal customers who call him for his service.  In addition, he knows the streets, avenues, and alleys of the city.  Although he works day and night, he also sells spare parts and car accessories (rims, rotors, and others).  He offers them casually and sells by the order.  He has also found this side business to be profitable and with the development of both, he hopes to settle in the field of transportation.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his work is knowing that he has the opportunity to advance and he feels grateful that people trust in him.  He really enjoys driving the city streets, even though on occasions, he has had to face inconsiderate passengers who haven't wanted to pay him the fair price.  Still, he knows that this is part of his job and he has to carry on.  He hopes that in the future he will be able to purchase his own car and establish a shop selling car parts, spares, and accessories.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he is content knowing that he has financial support, since this makes him feel more secure to advance with his job.  Likewise, he promises once again to complete his payments punctually, as he has done with the previous loans.

He lives at home with his parents and wife Mariela, 18, and their two beloved children: 3-year-old Ken and 1-year-old Andrea. He has been working very hard every day on their behalf so that he can provide them with better circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor five years, he has been buying and selling fresh fish, working with three co-workers who help him select, transport, and sell the fish. He has been able to comfortably maintain his family and provide for theirs needs this way. His constant desire to succeed led him to undertake this business, and little by little he has become well known for selling the freshest, most delicious fish in the market and always greeting his customers with a smile. He also rents out a motorcar, which is an additional source of income, and he occasionally drives in the afternoons. At first he found it difficult to adapt to the routine because he didn't understand the business well, but over time he has begun to find his footing. \r\n\r\nConversing with his customers is what he likes most about his job; the most difficult aspect of it is putting up with the intense odor that remains on his clothes and skin. He hopes that he will one day have an air conditioned vehicle to transport and store his fresh products for longer periods of time.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan cycle with MFP, and he is grateful for the opportunities and confidence the institution places in him.

Thanks to the enthusiam that she has always shown in her work and the personal desire she has to improve herself, she has worked in a number of different businesses and, in every one, she managed to save up money.  She used her savings to buy her first vehicle which is now used as a taxi.  Margarita has been in her business for a little over three years and, thanks to this, her income has improved and she has been able to cover some needs that her household face.\r\n\r\nWhat Margarita most enjoys about her work, as a vehicle owner, is that it allows her to travel constantly and enjoy the landscape of her area.  The most difficult part of her work is having to get up early in the morning in order to meet the morning rush hour demand.  She knows that her work is hard but she also knows that, in the shorter term, she will receive rewards from her hard work.  In the future, Margarita hopes to buy another car and to continue making progress.\r\n\r\nThis is Margarita's seventh loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support as it makes her feel more certain in making progress in her work.  She pledges, once again, to make her repayments on time as she has done with her previous loans.  She is very happy to be a member of her community bank because all of her fellow members are very responsible and supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nMargarita will use the loan for 1,500 soles that she has requested to buy some spare parts and to send her vehicle to the mechanics for its six-monthly service."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1117938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy spare parts and pay to have her car serviced","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-16T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-16T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":221.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":239.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":238.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":257.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":267.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":275.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.79,"local_amount":221.2,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":226.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099013,"comment":null},{"amount":91.87,"local_amount":239.64,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":245.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401898,"comment":null},{"amount":91.49,"local_amount":238.69,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":244.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456172,"comment":null},{"amount":98.7,"local_amount":257.47,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":264.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451838,"comment":null},{"amount":102.38,"local_amount":267.07,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":273.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447013,"comment":null},{"amount":105.77,"local_amount":275.93,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":283.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052918,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T21:36:12Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438240,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Vilma.

is Vicky, 39, resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Randy, a security guard, and mother of one child who is currently in elementary (school) level. By the grace of God, Vicky has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college. For most Filipino parents like Vicky, as she herself has been a college undergraduate, believe that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nVicky maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in to receive as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She also sells snack food for additional income. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands.\r\n  \r\nVicky dreams to be able to give her child a high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1118328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

The climate in the canton is subtropical due to its moderately high altitude, in contrast to the climate of the province\u2019s highlands between the Western and Central Cordilleras.  The canton is divided into two parishes: the urban parish of San Miguel de los Bancos and the rural parish of Mindo.  As in the other cantons in Pichincha province, the economy of Los Bancos is mainly agricultural, and is mostly based on raising livestock.  However, there has recently been considerable growth in ecotourism, especially in Mindo.\r\n\r\nVinicio is a resident of this beautiful canton.  He is a 41-year-old entrepreneur who has spent his life working in the field and feels very much at home there.  Vinicio is a native of Loja, but he decided to come to Los Bancos a little over 15 years ago to start his cattle business.  He lives alone, and has an 18-year-old son who no longer lives with him.  Vinicio works on his land about 12 hours a day caring for his cattle and maintaining his property.  In his free time he enjoys playing sports to stay healthy; he also enjoys going out in the surrounding area and admiring the beauty of the ecosystem and the vegetation there.  Vinicio is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, an institution that manages funds from Kiva and provides them to local entrepreneurs.  Vinicio\u2019s goal is to increase the number of cattle he has on his property and thus increase his agricultural production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1117899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase more cattle to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-06-17T02:00:56Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-17T02:00:54Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cosme Vinicio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":97.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":99.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.14},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.3},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.27},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.75,"local_amount":71.23,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":71.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334561,"comment":null},{"amount":82.54,"local_amount":81.94,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":82.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390485,"comment":null},{"amount":84.14,"local_amount":83.53,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149475,"comment":null},{"amount":86.3,"local_amount":85.67,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":86.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382599,"comment":null},{"amount":87.44,"local_amount":86.81,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989687,"comment":null},{"amount":89.55,"local_amount":88.9,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":89.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126096,"comment":null},{"amount":90.87,"local_amount":90.21,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":90.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516698,"comment":null},{"amount":92.63,"local_amount":91.96,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:55:49Z","rounded_local_amount":92.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068562,"comment":null},{"amount":389.78,"local_amount":386.95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":389.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494837,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T15:42:41Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438103,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 26 a\u00f1os, es una mujer joven, amable y muy trabajadora.

Tienen cuatro hijos, de los cuales dos de ellos son menores de edad, tienen 17 y 10 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1n en etapa escolar y dependen aun de lo que Zoila y Jorge. Viven en su casa propia, la que consiguieron con mucho esfuerzo y toda la familia pone mucho empe\u00f1o para seguir adelante. \n\nSu negocio es la venta de comida, ella misma se encarga de la preparaci\u00f3n de sabrosos potajes regionales, la clientela es atra\u00edda a su puesto por el inigualable aroma y el agradable sabor de sus comidas. Vende en la vereda de su casa, que est\u00e1 ubicada en un sector muy concurrido, aunque solo realiza este trabajo por las noches, ha visto que le genera buenos ingresos econ\u00f3micos. Se inici\u00f3 en este rubro hace 40 a\u00f1os, ya que desde muy ni\u00f1a ayudaba en la cocina y participaba en la preparaci\u00f3n de los alimentos al lado de su madre, oficio que tambi\u00e9n ella realizaba de manera ambulatoria. Este negocio le ha dado el dinero necesario para alimentar a sus hijas y pagarles sus estudios, pero siente que m\u00e1s adelante va a tener m\u00e1s gastos y el dinero le va a faltar, por eso desea tener un restaurante en su casa, donde pueda vender con mayor comodidad. Por otra parte, durante el d\u00eda, quiere incursionar en la venta de repuestos de moto, ya que ha visto por el trabajo que realizan sus hijos mayores que esta actividad tambi\u00e9n genera buenas ganancias; con ambos trabajos busca consolidar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos. Zoila disfruta mucho de su actividad, m\u00e1s a\u00fan adora ver a sus comensales contentos, pues le agrada conversar con sus clientes mientras disfrutan de sus platillos. Algunas veces se le hace muy dif\u00edcil atender a todas las personas que concurren a su puesto, a pesar de eso no decae en su af\u00e1n de salir adelante.\n\nEste es su cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 6 con MFP, por tanto agradece la oportunidad y confianza que ponen en ella. Por otro lado, se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas de manera puntual. Y le agrada ser parte del banco comunal al que pertenece, ya que ha visto que sus integrantes son personas responsables y solidarias.\n\nCon el monto solicitado (S\/. 3500) comprar\u00e1 ingredientes y algunos insumos que necesita para continuar con la preparaci\u00f3n de sus comidas. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n, invertir\u00e1 en materiales de construcci\u00f3n para acondicionar un peque\u00f1o local para la atenci\u00f3n de sus clientes. Y destinar\u00e1 cierta cantidad en la compra de repuestos de motocarros.","en":"Zoila is 50 years old. She is a happy, friendly and hard-working woman. She lives with Jorge who is 50 years old and who has been her partner for 35 years. They have four children of whom two are minors, 17 and 10 years old. They are of school-age and remain dependent on Zoila and Jorge. They live in their own house, which they obtained with a lot of hard work, and their family is determined to get ahead. \r\n\r\nHe business is food sales. She herself is in charge of preparing delicious regional stews. Her customers are attracted to her stall because of the unbeatable aroma and delicious flavour of her foods. She sells on the sidewalk in front of her house, which is located in a very busy area, although she only carries out this work at night. She has seen that she makes a good income from this business. \r\n\r\nShe started working like this 40 years ago, as since she was a young girl she helped in the kitchen and with the preparation of food at her mother\u2019s side, something she also did as a mobile-vendor. This business has given her to money necessary to feed her girls and pay their studies. However she feels that further down the track she will have more expenses and she will not have enough money to cover them. For this reason she wants to start a restaurant in her house, where she can sell more comfortably.\r\n \r\nOn the other hand, during the day she wants to start selling spare motorcycle parts, since she has seen from the work her older children carry out that this generates a good income. With both business she hopes to consolidate her income. \r\n\r\nZoila enjoys this work very much, and loves even more to see her diners happy, since she she likes to chat with her clients whilst they enjoy her dishes. Sometimes she finds it difficult to serve all the people who attend her stall. Despite this she does not falter in her eagerness to get ahead. \r\n\r\nThis is her sixth credit with MFP, and for this reason she is thankful for the opportunity and confidence it inspires in her. On the otherhand she promises to make repayments punctually. She is grateful to be part of the communal bank of which she is a member, since she has seen that its members are responsible and there is solidarity amongst them. With the amount she is asking for (S\/.3500) she will buy ingredients and some supplies she needs to continue with the preparation of her foods. She will also invest in some construction materials to air-condition a small restaurant-premises for the service of her clients. She will also invest part of the sum in the purchase of spare motorcycle parts. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1117972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients and some supplies for food preparation and the construction of a restaurant premises for her business.

He is married and the father to a son who is in his care.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to having his degree in systems engineering, he has owned an internet cafe in his community for a year, where he has gotten experience and knowledge.  He started this business when the old owner of the internet cafe decided to sell the business at a favorable price.  Elvin saw the opportunity to become independent and have his own business, so he found support from financial institutions to purchase the business with the hope of having a business and being able to get ahead.  This has been his first business that he has shared with his wife, who helps with the administration of the internet cafe.  He also has other income since he receives money from relatives who are outside of the country.  He is happy with the place he has found himself, since he has no competition in the area and has a fixed customer base.  \r\n\r\nHe is asking for this loan to purchase spare parts for the computers, such as mouses, monitors, keyboards, and more.  This loan will help because he can perform maintenance on his machines to offer better service to his customers.  His future plans are to open a second business, which will be a bookstore, to purchase other computers for faster service, and to remodel the internet cafe for a better presentation of the business.  He hopes to own his own home to avoid the costs of renting, and to have a stable business that generates more income so that he can get ahead with his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1117977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase computer accessories such as mouses, monitors, and keyboards.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-17T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-17T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvin Marin \t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-20T08:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613467,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-19T08:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452939,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308448987,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443848,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-17T21:43:24Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438130,"name":"Oscar Ovidio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar, se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol y a la crianza de ganado, vive con su esposa y tres hijos de 8,10, y 12 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 dedicado a la actividad agropecuaria desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde las seis de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las tres de la tarde.\nEl est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para poder realizar la compra de abono y herbicidas, que son los necesario para iniciar el cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol, esto le ayudar\u00e1 a tener una siembra libre de plagas y poder ayudar de una mejor manera a su familia.\nSu objetivo es desarrollarse como agricultor y crecer en la ganader\u00eda, ya que esto le ayudar\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n a su familia y a sus hijos para que sientan el apoyo econ\u00f3mico y puedan superarse en sus estudios\n","en":"Oscar, who works cultivating corn and beans and raising cattle, lives with his wife and their three children, who are 8, 10, and 12 years old.

Sadly, due to a lack of financial resources and the need to work to pay her expenses, Ana was not able to finish her elementary school education, but she dreams of doing this someday.

Vive en casa de su madre y juntas realizan grandes esfuerzos para progresar.\n\nSu trabajo es la venta de ropa, utensilios del hogar y gasolina, los cuales pone a la venta de manera quincenal o mensual. Cuenta con la ayuda de su madre que se encarga de comprar ropa usada, ollas, tazones, bandejas, escobas, combustible y otros art\u00edculos que luego vende por las zonas alejadas a la ciudad, principalmente en las comunidades ribere\u00f1as o centros poblados que carecen de estos art\u00edculos o no tienen acceso a la ciudad por la distancia y el gasto que esto le genera a sus pobladores. Ella se traslada en viajes por v\u00eda fluvial y su recorrido puede durar hasta 8 horas para llegar a su primer destino. Traslada gran cantidad de mercader\u00eda variada por lo que sus ingresos, al retornar, siempre son altos y sus ganancias, muchas veces, pueden triplicar su inversi\u00f3n inicial. Lleva en esta actividad cerca de 2 a\u00f1os, y eventualmente cuando se encuentra en la ciudad trabaja vendiendo productos de perfumer\u00eda por cat\u00e1logo. \nLe gusta mucho lo que hace, pues puede disponer de su propio dinero y aportar a la econom\u00eda de su hogar, tambi\u00e9n le permite manejar su tiempo y dedic\u00e1rselo al cuidado de su hijo, quien a su edad necesita todos la atenci\u00f3n necesaria.\n\nEste es su cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 3 con MFP, por tanto agradece la oportunidad y confianza que ponen en ella. Por otro lado, se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas de manera puntual.

She is separated from her husband and has a 15-month old son.  He is why she works hard-to offer him a comfortable life and a good education.  She lives in her mother\u2019s house and she and her mother work together to get ahead.\r\nShe sells clothing, household items and gas twice a month or monthly.   Her mother helps her by buying the used clothing, pots, bowls, trays, mops, fuel and other articles that she then sells in areas far away from her home city.  She sells mostly in villages or in remote areas where the people can\u2019t get to the city because of the distance and the cost. She travels by river and her trips can last up to 8 hours before she arrives at her destination.  She carries a lot of varied merchandise that give her a good income.  Sometimes she triples her initial investment.  Dalia has been in this business for about 2 years and when she is home in the city, she sells perfumes through a catalog.\r\nShe likes what she does because she can make her own money and carry the household expenses.  It also allows her to manage her own time and to be able to care for her son, who is at that age where he needs a lot of attention.\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP and she appreciates the opportunity and confidence given her.

She has been in a domestic union for 7 years, and has two children with her partner: 5 year old Daniel and 3 year old Ever.  These two little ones constitute her principal motivation for her constant dedication to her work.  She lives in her own home, which she was able to acquire recently with the support of her partner, and they are very happy as a result.  \r\n\r\nHer work consists of selling groceries, for which she must purchase the products--that she sells from the store she has set up in her home--at wholesale prices on a weekly basis.  Her clientele comes to her with the surety that in her store they will find every that is necessary for preparing meals, such as bread, milk, eggs, oil, rice, beans, and others.  In the same way, just in the past few days she has set up a section for accessories and hardware products, since she has seen that in the area where she lives there is a lot of demand for such items.  All of her customers are treated with much respect, care and with the joy that characterizes Gaby's youthful exuberance.  \r\n\r\nGaby began by selling just plantains and eggs that she would set up on a table in front of her house, and little by little kept on growing, and now she has been in the business for over 2 years.  She is open 24 hours a day and since she began this business she has worked alone, and she feels very peaceful and happy.  What she likes most in her work is the satisfaction of seeing her customers come back happy to have found in her store everything they need.  This small business has given her independence and general economic solvency to be able to manage the costs coming from feeding her children, watching after their health, and sending them to school.  She hopes to increase the size of her store, stock it with a greater diversity of products and keep the customers that she has been able to attract up until now.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, since as a result she will feel more secure as she moves forward with her work.  She is also committed to following through with her payments in a punctual manner.  She also feels satisfied belonging to her cooperative bank, since all of its members are very responsible and socially conscious.  With the requested loan (700 soles) she will purchase a larger quantity of staple products such as rice, sugar, and oils, and she will stock her hardware section by purchasing nails, piping and light bulbs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1117104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase grocery items and hardware products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-17T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-17T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gaby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":104.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":105.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":115.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":120.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":123},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":130.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.19,"local_amount":104.85,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":110.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099005,"comment":null},{"amount":41.26,"local_amount":105.02,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":110.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401888,"comment":null},{"amount":45.49,"local_amount":115.8,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":122.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456162,"comment":null},{"amount":47.4,"local_amount":120.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":127.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451829,"comment":null},{"amount":48.32,"local_amount":123,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":129.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447003,"comment":null},{"amount":51.34,"local_amount":130.68,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":137.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052909,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She is a widow and bringing up two children of school age on her own. Gulzada works as a secondary school teacher, and, as additional source of financing, she also raises livestock, having launched this business in 2000. Thanks to Gulzada\u2019s hard work, her farm, which had been  started with 10,000 KGS, has grown. Now Gulzada has 20 heads of sheep and goats, which brings in a monthly income of 10,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nIn order to develop her business further, Gulzada turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 135,000 KGS for purchasing additional livestock.

Her partner of the past 6 years is William, 38, with whom she has a 2-year old son.  They live in his mother\u2019s house, where they educate their son; they want to give him a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHer business is the rental of her car as a taxi.  She rents to a driver on a daily basis, from which she receives an amount that helps cover some of the necessities of the home.  However, to do this, her tool for work must be in optimal condition, from the cleaning of the outside of the car, to supervising, verifying, and proving that all the systems are working properly.\r\n\r\nShe carries out this work with the help of an auto mechanic, and also ensures that all the vehicle registrations are valid so there will be no problems with the transit authorities.  She has been doing this activity for 2 years, and was able to buy the car after a great deal of hard work and constant struggle in her previous business of selling food and clothes.  \r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it allows her to dedicate her free time to caring for her baby.  After doing other work, her income has increased, which allows her to improve her standard of living.  However, everything was not always so favorable; at the beginning, it was very complicated because she didn\u2019t know much about the business but, over time, her ability improved and she now feels calm about everything she is receiving.  In the future, she would like to buy herself another car and, little by little, create a large enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know she has a means of financial support since this lets her feel more secure in growing her business.  Likewise, she once again commits to making her loan payments on time the way she did before.  She is also very glad to belong to her cooperative bank, as all the members are very responsible and united.  With the amount requested (1200 Peruvian soles), she will buy some replacement parts, tires, and do the mechanical checkup that her car is lacking.  She will also obtain the registration documents, insurance and will refurbish some details.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1118131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to make repairs and obtain vehicle registrations for her car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-17T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-17T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luc\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":176.68},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":191.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":198.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":199.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":213.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":220.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.26},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.26,"local_amount":176.68,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":177.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099020,"comment":null},{"amount":71.77,"local_amount":191.41,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":192.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401913,"comment":null},{"amount":74.46,"local_amount":198.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":199.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456187,"comment":null},{"amount":74.97,"local_amount":199.93,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":200.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451853,"comment":null},{"amount":80.03,"local_amount":213.4,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":214.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447028,"comment":null},{"amount":82.51,"local_amount":220.03,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":220.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052933,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her neighbors and the local community are her regular customers. She also maintains a direct selling business as a source of additional income. She earns a minimum of PHP 450 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMercedita hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have her own car service that will be used for the business.

The older child is five years old, and the younger is three. Her husband is a migrant laborer. Her husband's parents are dependent on them. Shoira's love of sewing began in childhood. It is a profession which was passed on to her by her mother. In the past she sewed for her own enjoyment and needs, but after marrying and facing serious financial problems in the family she decided to help her husband who last sent her money four months ago. Her husband is currently unemployed and unable to send his wife money. She decided to sew seriously not just for herself but to order. After finding out about classes for women run by NABWT (National Association of Business Women of Tajikistan) in cooperation with IMON International, Shoira became an active participant and after learning the needed information, submitted an application for a loan. She is a very confident and skillful woman, and able to reach her stated goals. Shoira would like to buy a sewing machine and the supplies needed for sewing traditional and European dresses. She very much hopes for your kindness and help. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1115615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a sewing machine and the necessary fabrics for sewing of national and European dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shoira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":154.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":172.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":177.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.98},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.02,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":0.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294596305,"comment":null},{"amount":999.98,"local_amount":999.98,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":999.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301429827,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-18T09:29:20Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:32:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438538,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is 22 years old.

As he lives far from the city, he was unable to attend university, and instead stayed to help his parents. He also raises peanuts seasonally and early in the morning he sells the peanuts to traders in the market. His son is still young, but when there are more children he wants to provide them all with the higher education he himself could not obtain, and later build them homes and pay for their weddings. To do this he needs to save a certain sum for each child, and so Farhod is already beginning to save.

They live in her father\u2019s house, next to her sister and her two nephews.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling beer. Every Monday she orders from the distributors with whom she works, and they deliver the boxes of beer to her home, and she puts it in the refrigerator to be ready for consumption. She also sells soft drinks, ice, and fruit lollipops. She has been doing this work for more than three years with the help of her sister. For some time she has been selling roasted chicken on the weekends, as she has seen in this business the perfect opportunity to sell more beer and soft drinks. At times she also sells clothing.\r\n\r\nShe still remembers the first day that she began to sell drinks, all the fears and doubts that she had, but little by little she was establishing and learning the business.

She is a kind, supportive and very responsible woman. She has been with her partner, Victor, for 12 years. He is 54, and they have two children, age 12 and 3.\r\n\r\nRosa works selling food and juices. Every day, from early morning, she sells juices made from the freshest fruits of the region (orange, papaya, grapefruit and others), and breakfast sandwiches of egg, chicken, cheese, avocado or bolognese. In the evening she sells dishes typical of the region: the richest roast chicken, fish and pork, with her own secret seasoning. Her stall is on the pavement outside her house, and she has had it for 2 years. She also works for a state government agency, and also sells cleaning products door-to-door, such as detergents, air fresheners, wax and soap, so as to bring in some additional income. Like any woman wanting to excel, she has many goals, but the main one, for now, is to consolidate her food business, as she wants to develop a space inside her house to make the work easier and more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is Rosa's fifth loan with MFP, and she welcomes the opportunity and confidence placed in her. She agrees to make the repayments on time. She likes being part of the communal bank to which she belongs, as the members are responsible and supportive of each other. With the requested amount (1500 Soles), Rosa will buy fruits, ingredients and supplies to continue her work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1118136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fruit, ingredients and consumables to continue her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":220.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":248.23},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":249.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":266.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":274.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":176.4,"local_amount":460.18,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":472.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401915,"comment":null},{"amount":95.16,"local_amount":248.23,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":254.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456189,"comment":null},{"amount":95.82,"local_amount":249.96,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":256.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451855,"comment":null},{"amount":102.27,"local_amount":266.8,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":273.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447030,"comment":null},{"amount":105.35,"local_amount":274.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":281.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052935,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T20:02:37Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438479,"name":"Valon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valon is from Kosovo.

","en":"Abraham, 45, is a humble man who is married to Alejandrina, 44.  They live in their own house, which they bought 12 years ago, with their two beloved children, Jilmer and Noem\u00ed, who attend school.\r\n\r\nHe is a cocoa farmer and has much expertise after working with this crop for 15 years.  He enjoys his work because he has ample support from his wife and children (in their free time).  The income he makes provides enough to cover household expenses.  He believes the most difficult part of his job is having to transport the crops to the sales point, since the sacks are very heavy.  But even so, he worries about taking good care of his cropland in order to obtain a good harvest.\r\n\r\nAbraham is committed to paying back the loan on time and is happy to have access to financial support once again.  He always attends and participates in the communal bank meetings, and enjoys working with responsible people.\r\n\r\nWith the 700 PEN loan, he plans to buy fertilizer to spread over his crops after removing the weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1118181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T09:40:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abraham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":735.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121740,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-19T21:18:12Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438760,"name":"Faamanuia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faamanuia is thirty-two years old and married with four children.

Because they also need more support to cover the family's needs and costs, Samaher is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her husband purchase more spare parts to resell. This will increase sales and improve the family's income.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:<p>\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her partner is Romulo, who is forty years old. They both purchased a plot of land where they built their house with durable materials (cement and brick). They currently live there with their two children, who are students, and for whom they hope to provide a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nAlong with her husband, Dionisia takes great pains to get ahead day after day. They both hope that their children will have professional careers and a better future. To that end, they opened their grocery store thirteen years ago in their house, which is going well for them since it provides them with good earnings. What she likes best about her work is that she works with her husband while attending to her customers. In the future, they hope that their store will make wholesale sales since that would help them generate more income to cover their children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma] for trusting in her work. She promises to make punctual loan payments as she has previously done.\r\nWith this loan of 2,000 PEN [$750], Dionisia will purchase a bag of rice, a bag of sugar, vegetables, varieties of noodles, and other foodstuffs for her store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1118255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"purchase merchandise for her grocery store.

She has been separated from her partner for many years and has four children who are already grown and independent.  Only her 37-year-old daughter Diana lives with her.  Mis\u00e9lida owns her house, which she bought with great effort and after many years of saving.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is a multi-faceted woman who has a vision for business.  Mis\u00e9lida has developed different ventures according to the season.  One of her businesses is buying and selling basic staples such as corn, beans, and kudzu.  On a few special occasions or on celebration dates, she will sell clothing.  However, her main business activity is selling food since she enjoys cooking.  She has no hesitation in preparing and selling food every day, especially the delicious dish of chicken and fried potatoes commonly known as \u201csalchipollo\u201d, which is served with a healthy portion of rice.  This dish has become a favorite among all her customers.  Mis\u00e9lida has worked alone ever since she started her business six years ago.  She still gets excited about the process of growth that she has had to go through in order to earn the public\u2019s trust.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Mis\u00e9lida hopes to have a restaurant where she can sell all day and be able to prepare food in much calmer conditions since she currently works alone and into the night.  Even though she has gained experience through her work, Mis\u00e9lida still finds it difficult to serve all of her customers.  She expects all of her efforts to result in a fruitful outcome, just like in past experiences, so this is the only thing that drives her to press forward.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 10th loan with MFP.  Mis\u00e9lida is very pleased to know that she has financial backing and feels more confident about advancing in her work.  At the same time, she promises once again to complete her payments just as she did with her previous loans.  She is glad to be part of her Communal Bank since all of the members are responsible and supportive.  The amount of 2,500 PEN that she requested will be used to buy ingredients, supplies, and cooking utensils so that she can continue preparing her most requested dish and keep all of her customers happy.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1117955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients, supplies, and cooking utensils.
