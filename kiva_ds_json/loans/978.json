is Maria, 52, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Decoroso and is a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMaria operates a buying and selling business. What she basically does is buy clothes and shoes from wholesalers, then sells them with a little profit. Her products are t-shirts for men and women, shorts, shoes and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stock of supplies and products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years.

She tried to expand her business to prepare not only cold drinks but fix up her kiosk to be a coffee shop and she added more snacks. \r\n\r\nNow, a few meters from her home, the government is going to build housing for residents in her district, and usually the workmen take breakfast and coffee time in her coffee shop. So Ida is using this loan to buy more cigarettes, coffee powder, sugar and snacks to prepare drinks in bigger amounts. \r\n\r\nFrom the profit Ida can prepare a better life for her children, for example, buying lesson books and taking her family to a local amusement park. Her dream is to send her child to college at Indonesia

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family's daily needs and her children's education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nCarmelita hopes to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He's very responsible with his daily work because he always does the best to feel satisfied and comfortable with what he does, always looking for the benefit for his family.\r\n\r\nFrom a very young age he has grown corn twice a year, always making a living.  At the same time he has a small herd of cattle that demand his attention all day.  He personally cares for them, taking them to pasture, deworming them, giving them vitamins, and other things.  He's dedicated because he's the person who supports the household on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nV\u00edctor wants to continue earning more profit and to always have something to eat for his household.  This is why he went to Integral to request a loan.  This way he'll be able to finish paying back his debt on the cattle, because he had acquired them on installment.  He also wants to buy what he needs to keep the animals healthy.\r\n\r\nHe hopes and trusts in God that your help will be very useful.  He also hopes to pay back the debt early, because he has a good payment record.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1225120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to finish paying for his cattle and to buy supplies to keep them healthy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-10-26T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-25T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356447794,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-27T00:38:05Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:27:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":487843,"name":"Minerva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Minerva is 46 years old and married with one kid.\r\n\r\nMinerva is in the agricultural business raising pigs in the Philippines.

Suzanne lives together with her husband and children, and works together with her husband to provide for the many family expenses.\r\n\r\nFor almost three years, Suzanne has been selling a range of products out of her home.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stock of supplies and products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeonora hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and dreams to give her children a good and quality education.

As an itinerant saleswoman, it has been almost eight years since Emilienne began selling food packs -- bunches of akassa [a local dish prepared from cassava starch] accompanied by fried fish.

She is married to Jobert and is a mother to her children. She manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCharlene operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sells them with a little profit. Her products are pillow cases, bedding and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Charlene is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy RTW products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCharlene hopes to be able to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1222309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for additional stocks of merchandise needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-26T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-25T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.33,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6764.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315351096,"comment":null},{"amount":326.67,"local_amount":13332.98,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13528.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960235,"comment":null},{"amount":245,"local_amount":9999.99,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10146.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094947,"comment":null},{"amount":326.67,"local_amount":13333.03,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":13528.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484100,"comment":null},{"amount":163.33,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6764.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036626,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-28T19:37:10Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":487934,"name":"Tuvshinjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Tuvshinjargal is a 42-year-old widow who lives with her 4 daughters in a ger in Govi-Altai province in Mongolia.

lives in the Muranga area of Kenya, which lies in the central Rift Valley. She has one child and has earned a living for the last 20 years by producing milk and various crops. She enjoys farming, but suffers from a lack of capital. She will use this loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.  She likes being a client at Juhudi Kilimo because it offers low interest rates and good repayment terms. Her main monthly expense is caring for her family. When asked \"How will this loan benefit your family?,\" Esther replied \"I will get more income from my dairy cows and therefore be able to better provide for my family's needs.\" \r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

In particular, they have 5 milk cows, 3 calves, and a pig. Eliso milks cows and produces cheese and Sulguni (Georgian pickled cheese), which are sold in the capital city. Eliso has a rich experience in her work. \r\n\r\nEliso requested a loan to purchase hay to feed the cows during the fall and winter seasons. She planned to sell a cow for buying food for the cattle, but preferred to get a loan so she is able to keep her livestock. Hay is cheap now, but the price increases by 30% to 40% in the winter months. She can significantly save on the costs of feeding the cows. Since the cows will be fed properly in winter, they will give a planned amount of milk to the family. The income of the family will increase accordingly. Thus, Eliso will be able to increase her agricultural business and improve living conditions of the

is 50 years old. She is married and has two children, ages 30 and 26. In 2008, Gauri established her grocery store business, and she supports her family by working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day. In the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called pasal, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of pasal use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By purchasing inventory in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profits. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nGauri has already received and successfully repaid one loan from BPW Patan, which she also used to buy groceries for her pasal. In the future, Gauri plans to improve the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support.

is 29 years old and married, with two children. He is an Internally Displaced Person and lives with his family in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement.   He breeds sheep and cattle and additionally sells milk products and meat. Namiq has more than six years of experience in this field, thanks to his father who taught him the best way to look after cattle. \r\n\r\nNamiq usually buys lambs, which he raises and fattens in three to six months and then resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar.  Milk and yoghurt he sells to the neighbors. Milk and meat-selling bring AZN 150 income per month. \r\n\r\nMilk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in such everyday national dishes as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce.

She has a 16-year-old son, who is in his fourth year of secondary school. Both live in the city of Managua. Her work is selling food, especially breakfasts and lunches, in addition to tending a grocery store.\r\n\r\nShe began her business at the age of 35. She began selling food because the people who worked across the street from her house asked her for food and inquired about it, and so she decided to invest in a food business at home.  A short time afterwards, she began her grocery store business, since the people who came to her business were looking for products that are highly used in homes, and grocery store businesses are very scarce in this area.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLuzviminda operates a 'variety' store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five-pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue running her business, Luzviminda is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda hopes to give her children a quality education and dreams of expanding her business through all her hard work. \r\n\r\nShe faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

a difficult bout with adult acne, Skinfolk owner, Tisha searched and tried anything that could possibly cure her skin. One day, she placed an order for African black soup and raw shea butter and her body immediately responded to the natural ingredients found in these products. This discovery led Tisha to develop a passion for using and promoting all-natural skin products.\r\n\r\nWhen Tisha lost her job in 2008, she took it as an opportunity to follow her passion and started \"Skinfolk\", selling her own line of all-natural skincare products. Tisha is currently selling her products on Etsy and at local farmers' markets in San Diego, and her business is growing. However, due to a limited credit history and cash flow, Tisha struggled to secure the financing she needs to take her business to the next level from traditional sources.  \r\n\r\nTisha will use her Kiva loan to market her business and invest in higher quality materials. She hopes that with better marketing opportunities and more inventory, she will be able to increase profits and reach her full business potential. She eventually dreams of creating a stable financial situation for her family and would like to become a fair trade certified business in the near future.\r\n\r\nVisit Skinfolk online at:

is Mercy, 48, resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Noel, a businessman, and mother of three children, two of whom are already in college, while the youngest is still in high school. By the grace of God, Mercy has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Mercy. She herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMercy operates a vulcanizing shop. To vulcanize is to harden rubber by combining it with sulfur or other substances in the presence of heat and pressure. This is usually done to punctured tires. Vulcanization gives rubber strength, resistance and elasticity. She also sells tires. They have a tire supply. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 60,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy more equipment for their business and also for items used to maintain their equipment. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMercy dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1222963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto
