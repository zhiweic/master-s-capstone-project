Before that, she lived in the country of Belize where she worked as a household domestic.  One day she found out that her homeland could move forward, so she returned to El Salvador in hopes of starting a business that would allow her and her children to succeed.  As a result of a conversation with a friend, the opportunity to sell fattened chickens stimulated Mar\u00eda\u2019s interest to establish this type of business.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Mar\u00eda\u2019s main business input is the purchase of breeding chickens.  When she has chicks that are newly hatched, they can be used for two purposes: sold as-is or fattened.  She buys her chickens at a place that is located in the central part of the city, which is 15 minutes from her home.  Maria travels in a pickup truck.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will be used to buy concentrated feed for a batch of chickens that is four weeks old.  The rest of the money will be used to buy a new batch of chicks in order to continue the productive cycle without having to stop due to a lack of funds.  Since the loan will satisfy this need, Maria can continue to be productive without having to worry about losing her existing customers.  She can maintain her business in order to support the members of her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nIncreasing the productivity of her business will have a direct impact on her quality of life.  She will be able to generate more income, attract more customers, and maintain her investment.  In the future, Sra.

Since she started her business she has never taken out a microfinance loan. Now that the holidays are starting, Gr\u00e2ce wants to increase her stock, so has requested this loan to buy three bags of corn and seven bowls of dried cassava chips. The income she obtains from her business will allow her to increase her working capital, as well as to sell wholesale to the resellers located in Assiy\u00e9y\u00e9

Dambadarjaa, 61 years old, lives with his wife, son, daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in a house on a plot of land. He began transporting goods between cities in June and his son helps his father by finding clients and driving when he is tired. His daughter works at a beauty salon as a masseuse. His son-in-law renders taxi service to local people. His wife cleans houses for a living. \r\n\r\nIn spring just after the harsh winter period, he decided to build a new house on his land replacing his old wooden house which has deteriorated over the years and loses its heat easily through its walls and roof. Their old wooden house in the past years hasn't received any renovation and its wooden components all decayed and became beyond any repair. He has already built the house foundation but due to lack of finances, he hasn't begun other building work. So he is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass, vacuum-insulated windows, hardwood floors, shingles, foam and a iron door. \r\n\r\nUsing his purchased materials, he, together with his son and son-in-law, can build a high quality new house. The Important thing about building a new house is that it will allow the family to live in a more spacious and comfortable place where they will burn less coal for heating and release fewer pollutants into the air thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.  The borrower is a very hardworking individual who wants to see his grandchildren  living happily."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":688.85,"image":{"id":1389405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

But it so happened that he decided not to work in some sort of institution but to engage in his own business and earn a living. \r\n\r\nHe has been involved in unusual work. His business is the butchering and sale of meat. He has been involved in this business for many years and from it he gets a good wage. Sanginmurod sells beef and mutton at the bazaar in which he rents a butcher shop. Also available for sale are beef and mutton fat, and he sells the wool and skins from the livestock to leather producers. Every week, Sanginmurod buys livestock for butchering and sells the meat. He has regular customers, including people who buy for their own consumption and others who buy meat for cooking at restaurant kitchens. \r\n\r\nSanginmurod now needs to buy a few head of livestock for butchering and resale, so he appealed to Arvand and wants to take a loan.

She takes care of the cattle and sells their milk. The cattle business brings Usmon a good and stable income. He therefore wishes to expand the business. He needs to buy a few head of cattle for breeding and later resale. For this, Usmon turned to Arvand and wants to get a loan to buy cattle. \r\n\r\nHe hopes that this business will successfully expand and bring more revenue to meet the family's needs in a quality manner. Usmon thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":384.93,"image":{"id":1388555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-07-19T17:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-18T17:20:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Usmon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":190.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":194.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":199.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":204.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":210.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":190.1,"local_amount":190.1,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":190.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550157,"comment":null},{"amount":194.83,"local_amount":194.83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":194.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774378,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T13:46:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":584283,"name":"Asif","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asif is a very hardworking and active borrower of BRAC Pakistan.

Shameem has requested a loan from KIVA partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a sewing machine to sew more dresses and to satisfy the needs of her clients more professionally.

He runs a retail shop where he sales fresh milk.

He used the previous loans to restock missing items in his shop inventory, such as sugar, beans, baking flour, wheat flour, and cooking oil. These are the items that move fast and are always getting out of stock. He started selling fresh milk for customers to drink from his shop and for taking away. He sells hot and cold drinks as well as yoghurt. He has managed to pay back all his loans successfully.

is 29 years old and he lives in the small city of Vedi, which is in Ararat region. He lives with his parents, who are already retired, his wife and a small daughter. Tigran is the only breadwinner in his family and he works very hard as he strives for a better future for his family. Since being back from his military service, Tigran has tried to earn money by doing different work, but finally he became engaged in agriculture. He is cultivating a large variety of perfect vegetables (cucumbers, zucchini, tomatoes, beans, greens, eggplant, onions and radishes) tasty fruits (apples, apricots, peaches and plums) and also colorful berries (strawberries, dewberries, mulberries and currants).

lives in the Litein area of Kenya. He has no children and has been doing this work for five years. His primary income sources are milk and tea ,eggs.\n\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming,  'poultry farming.' His biggest challenge is 'catering for expenses.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Kapku.'\n\nBenard was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Farmer incentives.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session and he replied, 'Savings.'\n\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs.

She earns a very good income thanks to this produce, but since coffee is unstable in the market, she also buys and sells fruit. For this, she outfitted a space in her house where every day she collects mature citrus fruit that she sells to wholesale merchants. She also makes the most of selling her own harvests, from which she receives additional income. Now she wants to improve the coffee crop, since thanks to the variety she planted this year she did not have many losses with the insect infestation.

Shoira's husband works on a farm. She grows vegetables and sells them at a local market. Five years ago, Shoira started her livestock business, as her husband's income was not enough to meet the family's needs. Shoira has steadily grown her business, and her livestock is becoming competitive on the local market. Shoira receives a good income from her business, as her husband grows hay for the cattle and it is cheap for her to feed them. She wants to grow her business further and increase her income. She plans to use the income to provide her children with good living conditions and give them a chance for an education. She has requested a loan in the amount of 5000 somons for the purchase of cattle.

age 21, is single and lives in the Telavi district with his parents and retired grandparents. His mother is an accountant at the technical store and his father serves locals as a taxi driver.\r\n\r\nZurab had to start working at a very young age and runs a car import business with his friend. They order second-hand cars from Europe, USA, and Japan and sell them in their district. These young fellows get special orders from clients and their profit is small. \r\n\r\nZurab is very hard-working man, with a great desire to get ahead. He decided to diversify the business and obtain credit for starting a car wash.

He lives with his mother in a small village of Marneuli district. His mother is provided with a retirement pension. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Rauli was unable to study for a professional career. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize, and he does all the agricultural work to make sure of a good harvest. Besides, he has 2 milking cows and 5 pigs. Rauli\u2019s mother milks the cows and produces dairy products (yogurt, cheese) for selling. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Rauli decided to start his own business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The start-up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. \r\n\r\nHis application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $2,000 for purchasing a car. After purchasing a car, Rauli will begin trade with fruits and vegetables.

She will use it to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products, to add to her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to continue meeting her family's daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with happiness, and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nGloria dreams to be more successful in her business and hopes to have a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Recently, Tolib has repaired his home, which was in a very poor condition,  and all of his savings have gone towards the repairs.  Now, Tolib wants to obtain new merchandise from his suppliers, but he does not have enough money, so he has once again turned to Avrand.

That's why he is applying for a loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua to pay for his children's school tuition fees. This loan is big support for him, and he hopes to keep on working hard to develop his business to keep it capable of covering his family's needs. He hopes that one day poetry will be back to its golden age and he hopes it will reach a level that it would cover his family's needs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":996,"image":{"id":1390602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

He hopes to expand his scrap business and to buy a wider truck, where he can collect a larger mass of scraps in it."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":597,"image":{"id":1390646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy and sell iron scraps at a very good price, in addition to paying his children's school fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Saida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.563056 35.368889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-07-20T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-19T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":107}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":199,"local_amount":199,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":199,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728778,"comment":null},{"amount":99.5,"local_amount":99.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":99.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997700,"comment":null},{"amount":99.5,"local_amount":99.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":99.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419762312,"comment":null},{"amount":99.5,"local_amount":99.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":99.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429412385,"comment":null},{"amount":99.5,"local_amount":99.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":99.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439630367,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-15T06:42:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":584402,"name":"Matilde","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Matilde is 22 years old.

is married and the father of seven children, five of whom still attend school.

As the family expenses exceed the total income, Tamaz decided to start his own business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts was unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The start-up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poors and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $300 to open a bakery. George thinks that the business will be profitable, as it is in a great location and the only business of this kind in the area. \r\n\r\nAfter the bakery is opened, the family will have a stable income which enables them to cover everyday costs as well as expand the business in future.  With support of the start-up program, George will get an opportunity to be involved in his own business and tackle financial difficulties."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":113.62,"image":{"id":1390648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to open a bakery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Bughaura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-20T06:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-19T06:40:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":22.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":23.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":24.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":24.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":26.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.91,"local_amount":20.91,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":20.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857582,"comment":null},{"amount":22.2,"local_amount":22.2,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":22.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134231,"comment":null},{"amount":22.99,"local_amount":22.99,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":22.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107814,"comment":null},{"amount":23.37,"local_amount":23.37,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":23.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255350,"comment":null},{"amount":24.15,"local_amount":24.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":24.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019482,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-20T08:02:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":582999,"name":"Ha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ha is 37 years old.

Isatu, she is in her late thirties and is from the Waterloo Western rural area in Freetown. She is married with three children aged between 2 and 10 years old. Two of her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Isatu established her wood business. She began her business because she needs to create income to support the home. She works at the business 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to buy more wood to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and renovate her house. In the future, Isatu plans to change her business to a local food business.
