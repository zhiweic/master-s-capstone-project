She lives together with her life partner and their two children. Her work is buying and selling clothing: skirts, pants, dresses --everything for women, men and children. She has been a merchant for many years, selling as a mobile vendor. She has a lot of experience with sales, which has helped her to build a large customer base. She is well known in the community where she lives and in the surrounding area, and people like to buy from her because the products she sells are of the best quality and her prices are affordable. In addition, she offers excellent service. Ada is an enterprising woman, dedicated to her work, honest, and above all a dreamer. She is always looking for opportunities which will allow her to have a more prosperous future, and she will not rest until she has achieved this. Like all good merchants, she wants to expand her business, but she does not have sufficient capital; for that reason, she is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL that will allow her to buy clothing on a wholesale basis. Ada Marina has good credit references and is taking responsibility for paying off her debt, while at the same time offering her family a better quality of life.

Her life has been a success story since she joined GHAPE because her standard of living has been raised. \r\n\r\nShe is a hardworking farmer involved in the cultivation of cassava, beans, and maize. She says if given the new loan requested, she will expand her business and improve her yields by paying people to clear her farmlands, buy improved farm seedlings, and also buy fertilizers. She holds a positive view her business will succeed, since she has experience in the field due to longevity. She will put good fertilizer on the crops and also plant good improved farm seedlings.\r\n\r\nShe promises to expand her business with the profit, educate her children, provide medication for the family, and also buy pigs as to diversify her business. She prefers GHAPE loans because the members are educated before loan disbursement, repayments are made at convenient intervals, and no collateral is needed before loan disbursement.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":185.77,"image":{"id":1187077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

is a married woman who lives in the Baray district of Kompong Tom province in Cambodia.

With the time she has left, Chhel weaves bamboo baskets and containers to sell for additional income. She has been engaged in these two businesses for nearly 10 years, and works continually harder to someday earn a better living standard.

Her husband is employed, but the salary he earns is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Zohor's husband has had an office where he provides printing, translating and copying services to students and customers.  This has been a profitable project, but also not enough to cover his costs. Zohor wants to assist her husband in increasing the family's income, so she is requesting a 1,500 USD loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing a new copier machine. This will improve his work quality and increase demand from customers. This will increase the family's income and provide Zohor and her family with better living conditions.

He likes his work because it allows him to be constantly in the field, an activity that he has had an affinity for ever since he was a kid.  His current priority is to consolidate another business that consists of selling food and other basic needs products.

Her best selling items are blouses, jackets, and sweaters. \r\n\r\nOlga needs an additional 10,000 griven in order to purchase women's fall and winter clothing. She cannot always count on getting a loan from local loan institutions because they are reluctant to give loans to people approaching retirement age.

She lives in Paz Centro, which is an area with many traditional specialities such as cheesecake, tiste (a sweetcorn and cocoa drink), and the making of tile bricks. The people are very welcoming, humble and simple, but very hardworking. Maritza has an industrial grinder, which she rents out to people in the area who need to grind sweetcorn in order to make all the various typical foods that use it as an ingredient: tiste, pinolillo (a similar drink, but sweeter), tamales, g\u00fcirilas (a sort of sweetcorn pancake). She keeps the grinder in her house and has been in this line of business for ten years. Her mother taught her how to operate the grinder and derive an income from it. Her mother, who is now very old and sick, gave it to her so that she could continue the family business. In spite of these difficulties, Maritza's business is faring reasonably well.

earns a living designing and selling shoes in a small store that is located in a strategic place along one of the busy streets of the town of Likoni, Kenya. He is a married man responsible for caring for his beautiful wife and their single bouncing baby boy.

I did not realize that it was the beginning of a career. Then we received an order for carved oware games and within four weeks I had developed and mastered my own style. Now I also enjoy researching the game and its history. I wrote 'The Rules for Playing Oware' booklet, a practical manual officially recognized by the Oware Society in London and Ghana.\"\r\n\r\n\"Assistance such as this microcredit will encourage me to produce new items and improve my cash flow.

His main products are potatoes, broad beans, and ullocos (a twining perennial herb native to the Andes bearing fleshy tubers), and wheat, which he cultivates with much care because he knows that, at harvest time, he will be rewarded for his hard work and perseverance. Thanks to his hard work, he now owns large tracts of farmland.  \u201cI plant everything that the land produces, and to produce a product in season, you have to invest a minimum of 10 thousand nuevos soles\u201d, he says.  For this reason, Domingo is working hard to be able to acquire the necessary capital for the next planting.  Now, he wishes to improve the quality of his products so that they will have more value at the market. He is sure of achieving his goal because he also raises cattle.  He extracts 30 liters of milk from them daily and sells it.  In this way, he generates income to cover the household expenses.  \r\n\r\nHe belongs to the solidarity group \u201cCentral Checcche\u201d.  This is his eleventh loan with MFP and he hopes to continue receiving financial support from them.  He enjoys working in his group, where each day he learns new things about his business. In addition, he promises to be punctual with his payments.Domingo will invest the money in the purchase of organic fertilizers and in the payment of farmhands that are helping him plant his products.\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1179667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase of organic fertilizers and in the payment of farmhands that are helping him plant his products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-09T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-09T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domingo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T14:52:20Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":466587,"name":"Jeiko Porave Rekavo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 Jeiko Porave Rekavo se encuentra en el 2\u00ba Ciclo del programa, cuenta  con 10 integrantes mujeres, todas vecinas de la misma comunidad que se dedican a activiades varias.El comit\u00e9 se encuentra muy agradecido con la Fundaci\u00f3n y espera cumplir con sus metas ya que se encuentran muy entusiasmadas con los nuevos retos.\nUna de las integrates, la se\u00f1ora Jacinta se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos como maquillajes y cremas para mujeres.\nEl cr\u00e9dito solicitado ser\u00eda para la compra de productos como sombras, bases, rimmel, etc todo lo necesario para los maquillajes tanto diurnos como nocturnos.\n\n","en":"The program for the communal bank, Jeiko Porave Rekavo, is in its 2nd term and has 10 female members.
