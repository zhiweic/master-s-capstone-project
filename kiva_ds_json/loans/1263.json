At first their aim was fellowship and to grow with each other spiritually. However, with time they realized that they could do more as a group and started a Merry-Go-Round savings system with VEP which helped them to buy household items. After they learned about solar power that could be used for lighting and charging mobile phones, they decided to use it. This will save them money as they no longer have to buy candles and kerosene or pay to charge their mobile phones. This technology will also improve their lives by saving time and their health.\r\n \r\nTeresia, the group Secretary (on the left-side squatting), has suffered the effects of using kerosene. The smoke she has inhaled for years from the traditional open lantern has affected her lungs and eyes. Her eyes have turned red with irritation and she is constantly coughing from the smoke effect. Six years ago she also lost her neighbour through a fire accident in her home.  This experience has helped her appreciate the benefits of solar power and she acts as a promoter of this technology in the community.\r\n\r\nThe group applied for a loan to purchase solar home packages that would enable them to light at least 4 rooms, charge a mobile phone and use a small radio. They will no longer need to buy kerosene. The amount saved will be used as savings as well as to repay the loan. Together the group members will also spread the good gospel of using solar and transform their dark village into a bright one. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":63.55,"image":{"id":1468907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to pay for solar lamps","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kiambu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.166667 36.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T17:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T17:30:12Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agatha Waithira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresia Wambui ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Wandia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalene Wanjiru","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes Wairimu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina Waithira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian Nyambura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jecinta Waithira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy Nyambura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydia Wairimu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5417},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5409}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.55,"local_amount":5417,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5447.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867629,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T03:41:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631581,"name":"Irshad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irshad is a 36-year old married woman, living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

Arzikan has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide additional income for her family, Arzikan is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 15 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Arzikan's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows, 20 sheep and also a 2.25 hectare land plot, where she grows beans and potatoes. The monthly income amounts to 13,000 som (KGS). Arzikan is part of the \"Han-Burgo\" group that includes two more persons. All together there are three of them in the group.  Arzikan is the leader of the group. In order to further develop her business, Arzikan requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls to increase livestock headcount. Arzikan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to repair her

Alyi has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Alyi is involved in animal husbandry, having started 30 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Alyi's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows, 1 horse, 1 calf and also a 1.75 hectare land plot, where she grows beans, potatoes and perennial herbs. The monthly income amounts to 11,000 som (KGS). Alyi is part of the \"Han-Burgo\" group that includes two more persons. Alyi is the second member of the group. In order to further develop her business, Alyi requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep to increase livestock headcount. Alyi plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a new house for her youngest

She has been able to learn all of this thanks to her parents, and the help she has given her husband every planting season.  In order to get to the place where she works, she must walk half an hour.  In many occasions, her children also help her with the agricultural work.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be used to pay the labor necessary to pick the basic grains from this harvest in which she has 10,500 square meters of corn and beans.  Due to the change in season, she is worried because if she does not harvest the crops quickly, their family may suffer financial losses.  The loan will also help settle a debt, because 2 days before seeking this loan, her husbands father passes away.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to see her children get ahead.  She also wants to own the land that her house is on and be able to live without any problems, and for her family to have adequate conditions for a better future.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1469216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for the labor needed to harvest her crops, of which she has 10,500 square meters of corn and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T21:10:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-16T00:19:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631859,"name":"Maria Esther","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda una mujer trabajadora de cuarenta y cuatro a\u00f1os de edad tiene tres hijas de 21, 19 y 15 a\u00f1os de edad, actualmente se encuentra separada de su esposo, viven en casa de sus padres ya que el esposo se quedo en su casa, la misma que est\u00e1 ubicada en una zona urbana de la ciudad de Latacunga, en la parroquia Eloy Alfaro, provincia Cotopaxi perteneciente a la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador este es un sector muy comercial de la ciudad por su buena ubicaci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica.\nDebido a la mala situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica que atraves\u00f3 ella y sus hijas despu\u00e9s de la separaci\u00f3n de su esposo tuvo que trabajar y dedicarse a la crianza y venta de pollos, las ganancias las ha designado para la manutenci\u00f3n de su hija Ver\u00f3nica que es la menor de las tres debido a que sus dos hijas mayores ya est\u00e1n casadas y tienen su hogar formado\nSe dedica a la crianza de los pollos de 4 a 5 horas diarias, esta actividad la aprendi\u00f3 de su madre, pero le resulta muy dif\u00edcil ya que no cuenta con una persona que le ayude; ya que por su trabajo de medio tiempo no le alcanza para poder atender su negocio, las ventas las realiza en forma ambulante y bajo pedido, solicita este cr\u00e9dito para la compra de m\u00e1s pollos y balanceado debido a que se acerca la \u00e9poca de navidad y en estas fechas la demanda es mayor a la de otros meses y esas ventas ayudar\u00e1n a incrementar las ganancias de Mar\u00eda.  \nMar\u00eda quiere extender un sincero agradecimiento y felicitaci\u00f3n a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en Ecuador y a Kiva por hacer posible el crecimiento en su vida laboral y personal, para brindarle a su hija una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Mar\u00eda, 44, is a hardworking woman.

People are convinced that a person who goes to his work with pleasure and comes back home gladly every day, is the happiest one. Most of us are supposed to think about our future careers since childhood. But when we become older, we always change our viewpoints and preferences. Not all images, which we dreamed about, satisfy us. We become more realistic, and start envisaging a profession we want to choose. This is the choice of our path to the real life.\n\nThe world of departments of universities is prodigious. It consists of huge number of professions. Each of us is responsible for solving a great issue, for the new step in our life. in this moment of our lives, we doubt, take suggestions, hesitate, and listen to parents and friends opinion. This particular line of professions require people be able to make decisions quickly and manage people. Unfortunately, not always that we can define our abilities and make the right decisions at our young ages. I think no one, neither young nor old, can say quickly whatever decision they are up to.\n \nI thought many times and made a decision to enter the Liberal Arts department. What I like in this department is that it teaches leadership skills to us, historic thinking, religion, etc. Another reason to choose this department is that I would like to know little about juridical knowledge too. As a student of the department, it is necessary for me to graduate the university as a highly qualified person who is capable to think critically, and work in group by using my knowledge that I will already have.\n \nAnother opportunity that AUCA gives to every student is a Kiva loan. It is what can make dreams come true. I am applying for the loan as well, as I have financial difficulties and am not able to cover my tuition fees fully.\u201d \n

Jyldyzkan has a secondary education. The family's primary source of income is animal husbandry, a business Jyldyzkan started eight years ago by purchasing 25,000 KGS worth of livestock. Thanks to Jyldyzkan's hard work, the farm currently boasts one dairy cow and five goats. Her monthly income is 6,000 KGS. Jyldyzkan is a member of the group \"Almaluu\". This group includes three other people. So there are four of them. Jyldyzkan is the leader of the group.

Since he has just started to increase his business, Abdurasul will keep moving forward.  He wants to get a loan of $3,000 to buy a big oven in which to make his baked goods.  When he gets the oven, his workload will increase.  His wife will help him; if Abdurasul worked alone before, then they will work together in the future.

","en":"Farhod, age 36, lives in the Ghafurov district of the city of Khujand.   He is married and the father of two sons and a daughter.  His wife works for a glass factory. With his children growing up and family expenses increasing, Farhod himself holds two jobs and spares no effort  to provide for his family. \n\nFarhod has been working at the Ecology Center for the past 15 years.  At the same time, he has been buying and selling fish for the past two years.  This year, his oldest son graduated from high school and enrolled at the \"Finance and Credit\" School of the Khujand State University.  His youngest son and daughter are still in school.  \n\nFarhod currently needs to pay his son's tuition fees at the University, which represent a large amount of money for the family.

Saikal has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide additional income for her family, Saikal is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 14 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Saikal's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 2 calves, 6 sheep and also 10 hectares of land, where she annually grows clover and wheat. The monthly income amounts to 5,000 som (KGS).

It took her a very long time to recover from the death of her beloved husband.  But she had to raise and put her children back on their feet, so she decided to take responsibility for the business and material circumstances and she took the situation in her own hands.  Matlubakhon has a secondary education and she is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. She started in this business 35 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, she now owns two dairy cows and 5 sheep, and she cultivates 0.54 hectare (1.33 acre) of land on which she grows potatoes, cotton and vegetables.

She has a very big heart, because she is responsible for a 10-year-old boy, whom she is caring for because his family abandoned him. She lives with him in her own house. Norma's work consists of different activities, but she has two main ones. The first one is sewing in her small workshop where customers arrive looking for her help. She also sells beauty products from a catalogue. She has been working in these two jobs for 10 and 15 years respectively. She works alone because she does not need another person's help to do her work. She is accustomed to the rhythm and she has her ways to facilitate the work. What she likes about her work is that her time is her own, in addition to the fact that it is easy to do the housework. It is going well for her in all aspects and she has a good income thanks to the effort that she makes to market her products and sew as much as she can.

He is married and has three children. Makhkamjon lives with his family in a small house in a rural village. He cares about his family and does everything he can to keep them well-fed. He works as a call agent for a company that produces soft drinks. He earns a good income there, but it\u2019s not enough to cover all of the family\u2019s needs. So Makhkamjon does animal husbandry on the side. He has a plot of land where he can look after his animals. Currently he has several head of cattle, but he would like to increase their number. His wife helps him to look after and raise the cattle. The livestock business is lucrative, so Makhkamjon wants to expand this business by acquiring more animals.  He has turned to Arvnad to request a loan to buy a cow. Makhkamjon thanks Arvand in advance for its support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1460329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-11-15T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-14T16:20:10Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maxkamjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":74.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":76.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":81.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":97.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-13T19:32:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":632032,"name":"Bermet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bermet is a first-year student at the American University of Central Asia in the department of European Studies.

Becoming and developing as an independent country for Kyrgyzstan is not easy process, because we have to learn many things for the first time. Today, we have to solve everything by ourselves, whereas before everything was solved by the Soviet Union Government. In overcoming difficulties, many economic, social, and legal mistakes were made and still are being made. Twenty years of independence is not a small term for developing a country. I am almost a contemporary of our young country.\r\n\r\nSeeing failures in the implementation of goals of our country, I am really worried, but also sincerely happy for the success of our country. Many people go to other countries looking for earnings and a better life. Thanks to them, the main part of the population of our country is surviving and has come out of material and financial difficulties. Studying at AUCA, I am sure that only here I will get an excellent education and the best professional skills which will be useful in my future life. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to its students, one of which is Kiva loans. It is one of the best opportunities, because students are able to cover their tuition fees. I would like to apply for a Kiva loan, too. It will give me an opportunity to fully dedicate myself to my studies, rather than worrying about how to make money to cover my tuition.\u201d

Y en la actualidad con mucha m\u00e1s raz\u00f3n porque es madre y padre  para su peque\u00f1o.\n\nGracia a  su esfuerzo y sus ganas de salir adelante tiene por actividad econ\u00f3mica la venta de atol elaborado de ma\u00edz. El negocio lo tiene ubicado en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n y tambi\u00e9n lo desempe\u00f1a de forma ambulante. El objetivo del cr\u00e9dito es invertir en capital de trabajo y surtir su negocio en la compra y venta de materia prima para la elaboraci\u00f3n del atol como ma\u00edz, canela, az\u00facar, vasos descartables, bolsas, leche, para que en un futuro no muy lejano pueda obtener mejores ingresos.  Yesenia agradece la ayuda que los inversionistas kiva les brindan a personas de escasos recursos y pa\u00edses pobre como es Nicaragua para tener un medio de trabajo digno.\n","en":"Yesenia is 21 years old and is a single mother with a 3-year-old son.  She is originally from Managua, which is located in the central region of her country.  This young mother is known for being responsible, hardworking, and for dedicating her life to helping offer a better future to her young son.  In her free time, she likes to enjoy the company of her son.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, she wasn't able to go to school and instead had to work starting at a very young age.  Currently, she has an even greater need to work because she is playing the roles of both mother and father to her little son.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts and desire to get ahead, she is able to work selling atol (a traditional, cornstarch-based drink).  She runs her business from her house and also sells as a street vendor.  The purpose of this loan is to invest in working capital and stock her business with raw materials that she will use to make atol.  These include corn, cinnamon, sugar, disposable cups, bags, and milk.  She hopes that with this loan she will soon be able to obtain greater profits.\r\n\r\nYesenia is thankful to Kiva lenders who help those with scant resources and who are from poor countries such as Nicaragua because it helps support them as they obtain respectable ways to support themselves."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.48,"image":{"id":1469407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"invest in working capital and buy raw materials for her business such as corn, cinnamon, sugar, disposable cups, bags, and milk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-11-15T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-14T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesenia Yahoska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.09,"local_amount":1252.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1252.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545965,"comment":null},{"amount":56.39,"local_amount":1409.72,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1410,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199740,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-15T21:27:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631934,"name":"Jose Salvador","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nJos\u00e9 de 44 a\u00f1os de edad habita en casa de su propiedad junto a su esposa y sus dos hijos.

To help address this issue, Roeung has applied for a loan of USD 500, which will be used to pay his tuition fees. \r\n\r\nRoeung is very delighted and grateful for the loan funded via a program like Kiva to allow poor student like him to pursue a higher education and contribute to the future development of Cambodia. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be disbursed over several years and paid directly to the educational institution at the time of enrollment fees for each academic year.  Accordingly, there is the possibility of a small variation in loan amount and repayment terms, based on shifting class availability and prices.  \r\n\r\nKiva lenders will be notified with a journal update in the event of any future changes to the loan terms.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1462683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay his tuition fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kep","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-11-15T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-14T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roeung","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T16:55:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":632054,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida is 57 years old, married, and has two children.

is Alicia, 52, resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nAlicia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nAlicia dreams to have another stall and hopes to have a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":256.67,"image":{"id":1469680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken, and vegetables and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-11-15T18:40:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-14T18:40:25Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.33,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":7128.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478947,"comment":null},{"amount":93.34,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4073.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701349,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-15T20:48:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631946,"name":"Barbara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Barbara started BLS Eldercare in February 2009.
