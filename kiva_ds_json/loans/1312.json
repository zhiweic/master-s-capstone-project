","en":"Latofat is a resident of Dushanbe and is 54 years old. She is starting a new business. Latofat knows how to sew and tailor, and wants to use her skills to earn an income. Latofat plans to open a sewing business in her home. She has already set aside a room for the work. \r\n\r\nLatofat is requesting a loan because her personal savings are not enough.

He has a small plot of land where he grows crops and lets his cattle graze. His wife helps him look after and raise the cattle. Animal husbandry brings Sayfullo a good income with which he can fulfill all his family's needs as well as educate his children in good schools.

","en":"Raima is a 57-year-old widow with three children.  After her husband died, Raima struggled for a long time with the death of someone so close to her.  She needed to raise and care for her children, so she decided to take the household and the material responsibilities of her family into her own hands.  She has been involved in raising livestock since 2008, a business she started with 20,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her tireless work and support, Raima now earns a monthly income of 12,000 KGS.  Her farm now has four dairy cows and a small apple orchard, which brings a decent income.  In the fall, Raima and her children gather the apple harvest and sell the fruit at the local market for extra money.

is married and has four children.  She has been working for 25 years.  When her husband became ill and couldn\u2019t work, she endeavored to look after her children and to be the breadwinner for her family.  At first she did crocheting and knitting at home, selling the items to her neighbors and her circle of friends.  Later she began selling at the market.  Alongside the knitted items, she began selling vegetables.  She would also go to fairs.  \r\n\r\nWhen the municipality opened an arcade for handicrafts sellers, Melahat applied and was accepted.  For the last seven years, she has made and sold handicrafts in the arcade.  Thanks to her work, she has made a living and raised her children.  All of her children except for her younger son are now married; Melahat wants to marry him off, too.  \r\n\r\nBecause she didn\u2019t have capital, she couldn\u2019t buy materials.  With the loan she gets from Maya, she\u2019ll be able to buy materials and supplies, and she\u2019ll be able to offer a greater variety of products.  With the tulle and lace she is going to buy, she will sew doily and tablecloth sets, and increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nHer only hope is not to lose her health. As long as she is in good health, she wants to continue working.  She wants to continue selling in the arcade.  Because the arcade is located in the town center of Karam\u00fcrsel, it is busy every day.  She feels that she has the chance to socialize and to meet many people by working in the arcade, and for that reason she doesn\u2019t want to leave.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n\r\nMelahat Han\u0131m,evli ve 4 \u00e7ocu\u011fu var.

daughter. Aiymkan has a secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Aiymkan raises livestock, having begun 23 years ago with a livestock purchase of 700 som KGS. Aiymkan resides with her daughter and son-in-law, who help her around the homestead.

is a married woman and a mother of two.

When her aunt got sick, she decided to transfer the shop to Zeynep, who began to work at this job, thanks to her aunt.  She did not have any stock when she first began in this business.  She took the business over with great courage and borrowed from her aunt.  She paid half of what she owed in only four months.  \r\n\r\nThere was only hosiery in the store when she first took the business over.  She then got in contact with local women who work in their homes and make muslin, towels, prayer rugs, and picot items.  She bought some trousseau items that the women produced, displayed them in her shop, and received a lot of new orders from customers.  Both Zeynep and the other women earned a lot.  \r\n\r\nShe is now working with ten women.  With the loan from Maya, she wants to buy women\u2019s clothing, especially winter clothes.  She believes that if the variety of the products is larger, she will make more sales.  She wants to advance her business, open a bigger shop, and support her children's education without depending on anyone.  She wants to stand on her own feet and move forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\nZeynep Ye\u015filda, evli ve 2 \u00e7ocuk annesi.  \u00c7ocuklardan bir tanesi okula gidiyor.

Kalygul has a secondary-specialized education. She is very responsible, personable and happy. At the present time, Kalygul and her husband are involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 9 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Kalygul's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 horse and 20 sheep, and also 3.34 hectares of land, where she primarily grows beans. They sell their harvest to wholesale distributors. Her husband provides significant support with the business.  The monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Kalygul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows and sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Kalygul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a new house."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1514462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows and sheep in order to increase livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Boo-Terek village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-22T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1012.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1012.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":660409,"name":"Dekontee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dekontee is 28 years old and lives in the town of West Point.

She uses these as well as the internet for inspiration for her variety of designs. \r\n\r\nShe took her first loan from Kiva 10 years ago. With that loan, she bought materials, and in turn gained capital, thus increasing her earnings. In the summer, she was able to sell a good amount of products from her seaside stall.

and active women, and she has four children.  She married very early, and therefore could not continue her education after finishing secondary school.  Thus, she does not have a higher education.  Because Malohat and her family live in a rural area, she could only find work in agriculture, and she has been working for 10 years in this field.  Not long ago she began working with Arvand, the first time receiving a loan for consumer needs.  Because her house has fallen into a state of disrepair, Malohat now hopes to make repairs to her house.  The money she has saved from her salary is not enough to pay for the repairs, so she needs additional sources of funds.  For this reason, she turned once again to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to purchase building materials to repair her home.  Malohat thanks Arvand in advance for its support. \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1491283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T19:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T19:20:13Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malohat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":362},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":374.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":387.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":401.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":415.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":429.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":444.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":460.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":476.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":493.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":510.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":528.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":547.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":566.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":585.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":614.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T17:42:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":649771,"name":"Lyantonde Twimukye Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jovanis is a single mother of five children who has seen them through school and provided for their basic needs using income from selling groceries.

is a 36-year-old married woman, from Kulashi village. She  lives with her husband, mother-in-law and father-in-law, who is veterinarian and gets 250 GEL per month. This is the only source of the family's income. So Natia has great desire to be involved in her own activity and do her bit for the family's welfare. \r\n\r\nShe has arranged the place with all necessary things for a grocery store and now requested a loan for products.

He is the father of a fifteen-year-old boy. He works in agriculture because he has worked in this trade since he was little. Estanislao does not have a formal education. During his youth, obtaining access to educational services was too complex because he lived in a rural area, and it was far away from the town where the national school was situated. Estanislao lives with his wife. She manages the household, and she's a part of the community's communal bank. Their son is completing his basic education at a school within the community. \r\n\r\nEstanislao has worked in agriculture since he was thirty-six years old, particularly in the cultivation of staple grains. His son helps him during the morning since he studies during the evening. Estanislao's parents, who dedicated their entire lives to agriculture, taught him the trade.

It was difficult for her to continue her studies because she lived very far from the Instituto Nacional and, due to the economic situation that confronted her family in those days. With the passage of time, she has been learning domestic tasks, to which she is currently dedicated. At the age of 18, she decided to become attached to her life companion, who is presently working in the United States, striving to offer the best for his family. They are now the parents of a two-year-old boy.\r\n\r\nNubia works with an aunt, helping in sales in a small cafe in the Centro Escolar, where they sell Salvadoran snacks, pastries, and other fast foods.

In addition to the earnings she receives from working in the shop, she also receives remittances from her husband in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe loan Nubia is requesting through CREDICAMPO is for purchasing products of primary necessity, since she plans to open her own store.

Her clients are her neighbors, relatives, friends, students, and others.

The months she considers to have the highest demand are January, February, March, May, August, September, October and November because she makes few sales during the other months.  The biggest challenge she faces is the increase in cost for the materials she uses. \r\n\r\nIn regards to competition, there is hardly any, because in her community there are no tailors of this type.

Because animal husbandry is one of the primary types of work among the village residents, he has a lot of experience taking care of livestock.  Olimjon is currently 46 years old, married and has four children.  His family, like many others, is involved in breeding cattle and producing milk.  His oldest son went to Kazakhstan to find work.  The rest of the children help Olimjon. To provide for his family and future for his gransons, Olimjon has to expand his business and, with the onset of cold weather, stock up on feed for the winter.  Some of his friends recommended that he obtained a loan from MDO Arvand.  Olimjon decided to obtain a loan from MDO Arvand and put in his request.  He plans to use the loan to buy livestock and a large quantity of livestock feed.  He is very grateful in advance to MDO Arvand for the financial support."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1493068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock and a large quantity of livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T22:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T22:00:19Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olimjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":12500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4040.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4165.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4293.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":848.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":874.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":901.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":660521,"name":"Mildred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mildred works hard to support her family.
