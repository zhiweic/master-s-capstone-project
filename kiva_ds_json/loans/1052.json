She lives in the Khoni District with her 18-year-old son. Ekaterine requested loans from local financial institutions several times in order to start an agricultural business, but did not have success. Her loan requests were rejected every time due to low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salary Ekaterine earns working as a cook. Seasonally, the family sells the harvested nuts and maize that were grown on the family-owned land. It is hardly enough for the family to cover everyday expanses.  According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category. Ekaterine requested a loan from Credo to start a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up program loans money for business start-ups and \"re-startups.\" It provides access to credit with less rigid conditions for the country's rural poor, who usually do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, Ekaterine will purchase a milk cow. She will place it in the old, empty farm building located in their yard. Ekaterine will work hard on the farm. She will produce cheese and sell it in the village. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income. Their income will double, and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1289789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a milk cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kukhi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-02-06T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-08T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ekaterine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":69.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":92.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":94.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.73,"local_amount":69.96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":72.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861351,"comment":null},{"amount":45.07,"local_amount":72.12,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":74.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570155,"comment":null},{"amount":46.99,"local_amount":75.18,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":77.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968788,"comment":null},{"amount":47.9,"local_amount":76.64,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":79.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749207,"comment":null},{"amount":49.81,"local_amount":79.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":82.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613112,"comment":null},{"amount":50.91,"local_amount":81.45,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856839,"comment":null},{"amount":52.47,"local_amount":83.96,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":86.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133504,"comment":null},{"amount":54.37,"local_amount":86.99,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":89.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107110,"comment":null},{"amount":55.76,"local_amount":89.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":92.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254689,"comment":null},{"amount":177.99,"local_amount":284.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":294.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440018870,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-06T18:50:08Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:40:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525007,"name":"Mariana Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mariana Luz vive junto a sus hijo en casa propia;

Her eldest daughter is a college student.  Uul has worked as a nurse at the local hospital for many years. Despite all of her problems, she is cheerful and fun. She firmly believes in her family's bright future. A major source of income for the family is Uul's work in animal husbandry.  Through perseverance and hard work, Uul was able to start her business with 9,000 KGS.  Currently, her monthly income from the business is 3,000 KGS. In order to further develop her business, Uul turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan 100,000 KGS to buy one dairy cow and a calf so that she can increase her revenue from selling milk. Uul plans to invest her income from the loan into increasing her number of cattle.

The family resides in their own house which was built last autumn. In June 2012 he began running newspaper, magazine and mobile phone sales, renting a shop at a trade center. \r\n\r\nCurrently his wife is operating this shop because in October 2012 he began purchasing heads and intestines of livestock from brokers and then cleaning and classifying them. In the end he sells them to customers and some outdoor markets. Also he uses some of them in his family's daily food. One time he said that by using livestock intestines in food, the family really decreased their food expenses significantly. Even though he has been running his intestine sales business for just three months, he has already attracted quite a number of clients. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in is incompletely built and in wintertime, it really loses its heat, and as a result the family gets chilled to their core. The house needs its roof to be covered with metal, walls to be insulated both from inside and outside, and floors to be molded. So Sainsanaa is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase metal, glass cotton, bricks and cement. As a result, the family will be able to live in a comfortable and warm place and most importantly, the house will preserve its energy and enable the family to burn less coal, thus contributing to the effort against air pollution.\r\n\r\nThe borrower is a very hardworking individual who greatly cares about his children's

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGeorge has requested loans from local financial institutions several times, for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to restart his family business, which was stopped a couple of years ago because of financial problems. His loan request was approved, as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with fewer conditions, to the country's rural poor, for business start-ups and restart-ups. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low incomes, and they often do not have access to credit.\r\n\r\nWith the credit, George will purchase chickens to restart a poultry farm.

As a business, she has had a bar-restaurant in a neighborhood of the town for approximately 1 year. She benefits from good experience in this field, but her capital does not allow her to satisfy all her clientele anymore, and they are sometimes obliged to go to the competition. This is because of her small capital.

Several years ago, she divorced her husband and is raising their three children on her own. She's forty years old and endures a harsh existence because her ex-husband pays no alimony and offers no assistance with their kids. Mahfirat's parents and loved ones try to help as much as possible; however, their help just isn't enough, for every year the children demand more and more resources. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Mahfirat decided to earn a living by starting a business. She went to courses offered by the \"Women's Business Association\" and received a certificate of completion. She learned a great deal and is confident in her ability to successfully lead a business. She wants to focus on profitably reselling women's and children's clothing. She plans to use future profits to obtain a good education for her children and supply them with healthy food. \r\n\r\nShe's asking for a loan of 1000 somoni in order to purchase her first inventory and start her business. Mahfirat is hoping for your help.

Her family is her biggest motivation and the cornerstone of her existence.\r\nTwo years ago she decided to get started with her business idea. That's why she set up a small food stall located next to a construction site.

She was not able to study for long because her parents had a very low income, but with effort she studied up until the fourth grade of primary school. She is married with three children, of whom one is still a minor and depends on her and her husband financially. Her other two children are adults, married and living in their own houses.\r\n\r\nShe has made a living in agriculture since she was very young, as this has been the only way for her and her family to earn an income. Today, she and her husband continue with the same work, which has helped them to cover their basic home necessities such as clothing, medicine, and food, among others. Her crops are located 500 meters away from her house, and they walk to and from the field every day. This allows them to care for and maintain the crops.\r\n\r\nMirian is asking for help to buy fertilizer and pay the labor costs to cut and collect her crops. She will then be able to sell her good-quality product in the local market in order to earn an income and continue providing food for her home.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to give her son a better future and a better lifestyle, so she manages to save for his studies so that he can become a useful man who can work and defend himself in life with his studies. She also hopes to continue improving her lifestyle every day and to help her parents with what little she earns from her crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1290257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer and pay labor costs to maintain her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-02-07T00:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-09T00:00:01Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirian Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T21:55:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525133,"name":"D\u00fao San Vicente Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao San Vicente\nDo\u00f1a Ver\u00f3nica de 26 a\u00f1os e integra el d\u00fao San Vicente, representando al grupo la se\u00f1ora Ver\u00f3nica quien se dedica a  la elaboraci\u00f3n  y venta de servilletas, como tambi\u00e9n la venta de ropa t\u00edpica, actividad con la que ella percibe ayuda econ\u00f3mica para el sustento de sus dos hijos,esta solicitando este credito para la compra de materia prima para la elaboracion de servilletas.","en":"San Vicente Duo\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica, 26, is a member of the San Vicente duo and represents the group.

","en":"Indira is 30 years old, married and has four children.  According to her mother, the children and husband actively help with the business.  To provide an income for her family, Indira is involved in animal husbandry and farming.  Thanks to her hard work, the business allows her to bring in about 5,000 KGS per month, which serves the source for covering expenses for food and basic family needs.

used the previous loan to buy manure to boost the fertility of the soil to increase production.She is 45 and married with seven children. Three of her children are below 18 years of age. She lives in her own house located in Fort Portal, Uganda. She is a farmer and has been farming for ten years. This has enabled her to buy more land and also start to build a new residential house.

lives in the happy and warm city of Chincha, known for its varied gastronomy, beautiful beaches and happiness of its people.

To cover his education expenses he works at a parish in the city about five hours a day.  He believes he is doing well because he is responsible and wants his family to be proud of him.\r\n\r\nKevin is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their support, he is able to buy construction materials such as matting, wood and cane so he can put the roof on a small room where he plans to live.

is from the village of Kvemo Khvedureti. He is 31 years old, single and lives with his parents. His father is a pensioner and also works as a stone-mason. Zaza cultivates a family-owned plot of land, growing carrots, beets, onions and potatoes and selling them to vegetable retailers. In addition, the family has a calf and a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. The cheese is sold at the local open market. \r\n\r\nZaza has received a loan as part of a start-up program so that he can establish a new family business.

lives in the Nanyuki area of Central province, Kenya. He is married and has five children. He owns a tea tree farm, a business he has been operating for one year now. Besides this, he has been a horticultural farmer, planting potatoes, maize, beans and wheat. This other type of farming has been doing for ten years. The oil from the tea tree is used to manufacture cosmetics.\r\nHe learned of Milango through a friend who invited him to the group and he joined with an aim of accessing credit to improve on his business operations.

and Epiphania manage a cacao farm with around 700 trees in the village of Pueblo Viejo. The village is located outside the electric grid, next to an under way highway that will connect western Belize with eastern Guatemala. The couple has raised 11 children, the youngest of who is 15 and oldest 33. \n\nThe farm is truly a family business, as everybody is expected to help out when they can. Epiphania has been instrumental in growing and harvesting cacao. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to have a better product. Especially now that we can sell it wet, we just need to take care of the trees,\u201d says Santiago. The possibility of selling wet cacao at the farm gate has passed the burden of fermenting and drying from the farmers onto the buyers. \n\nA cacao farmer of seven years, Santiago started growing cacao inspired by the arrival of a new market in Toledo. Equipped with some seeds and bags for planting them from the local co-op, Santiago planted his cacao in the foothills of the Maya Mountains and has been successfully tending to them ever since. His favorite thing about cacao is that once it\u2019s producing, it is a secure and stable source of income. \u201cSaturday I harvest, Sunday I have the money. It\u2019s not like planting beans and corn, which takes six to eight months to harvest,\u201d says Santiago. For Santiago, the most challenging part of cacao is fermentation, because the beginning of cacao harvest coincides with the end of the rainy season. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to hire help with cleaning their 700 cacao trees as well as bagging 200 new seeds for a planned farm expansion. Once bagged, the seeds take about six months to grow to seedlings that can be transplanted into the ground as soon as it has at least four healthy leaves. The cleaning and bagging will require and create 64 hours of labor in the community. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":169.14,"image":{"id":1290221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean 700 cacao trees and expand farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Pueblo Viejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-07T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-09T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":47.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971163,"comment":null},{"amount":41.7,"local_amount":83.4,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":84.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751688,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":41.69,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":42.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993429,"comment":null},{"amount":20.82,"local_amount":41.64,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255598,"comment":null},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":41.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136439,"comment":null},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":41.7,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":42.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900656,"comment":null},{"amount":20.33,"local_amount":40.66,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":41.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088537,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-07T19:14:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525098,"name":"Brigido","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Brigido, age 65, and his wife Andrea live in the beautiful village of San Jose, which is located in the foothills of the Maya Mountains.

is 28 years old. He is an IDP (internally displaced person) who lives in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement with his wife and two children. He is farmer who has grown seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last five years. He chose this business because it is profitable and fresh crops are in high demand. People use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits serve every family's table in Azerbaijan. They are also used to make fresh punch.\r\n\r\nRashad sells his crop in the Bilasuvar central bazaar. His monthly income is 250 AZN.

the few he already owns.  This is his main work.  In his region, raising cattle and cultivating agriculture is a very important practice.  Therefore, he takes it very seriously in order to support his large family.  There's work in his village, but not enough for everyone.  Many travel to Russia to earn money, but Ilhomjon doesn't want to travel to a foreign country and tries to live and work in his homeland. Ilhomjon is trying to grow his business and he does everything possible to ensure that his family lives prosperously.  With this loan, Ilhomjon plans to buy a few head of cattle and expand his business.

Her husband has been working as a salesman for a company since 2007.  \r\n\r\nAntonia has a business washing and ironing clothes for families in her community.  She charges them $3.00 for a dozen pieces of clothing.  She has been doing this kind of work for more than 5 years.  Previously, she worked as a domestic.\r\n\r\nAntonia will invest this loan in a closet, which is something she doesn't have in her home, so that she can keep her garments neat.
