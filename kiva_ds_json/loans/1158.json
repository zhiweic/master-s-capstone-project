Her greatest wish is to make the business grow so she can combine various services like spa, beauty salon, permanent make-up, among others and to improve her quality of life in order to be able to offer more employment opportunities.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1381318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Antonio de Prado","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T23:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T23:30:04Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60080},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61721},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63406},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65138},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66917},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68744},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70621},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72550},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74531},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76567},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78658},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80806},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83012},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85279},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87608},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90001},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92458},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94983},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97577},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100242},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102980},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105792},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108681},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111648}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":578073,"name":"Intisar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Intisar is a 55-year-old widow who has to work hard in order to make her living.

He says that for more than 10 years he has worked selling dough and he does this with the help of his motorcycle. Everyday, Lorenzo gets up very early to start grinding his boiled corn.

Fizura's husband works as a farmer. \r\n\r\nTo earn a consistent living wage, Firuza works as a merchant. She learned her trade early on in her childhood. When she was 15 years old, she traded products to pay for her school expenses. She used to sell a just bit of produce, but now she has significantly expanded and stabilized her business. Since 2011, she repeatedly received loans from Arvand to grow her business, which helped her successfully expand her business and grow the profits earned from it. \r\n\r\nToday, she has a store where she sells her goods. She also has a wide assortment of food products, consisting of canned foods, pastries, pastas, teas, coffee, as well as household goods such as soap, laundry detergents and others. Firuza buys her products from suppliers and sells them in her neighborhood. \r\n\r\nHer progress does not stop there--she wants to further expand her business, since demand for her existing products is growing and demand for new products is developing in her neighborhood. Firuza has applied for a loan from Arvand to purchase additional products to better equip her store.

39 years old, lives with his wife and two children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in their old house on a plot of land. He has been rendering taxi service to local people using his own automobile since 2011. His wife gets a welfare pension monthly. His children both go to high school. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some renovation such as replacing old windows and insulating walls. He is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as vacuum insulated windows, planks, shingles, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, he can repair and insulate his house and provide comfortable and warm accommodations for his family. The renovated house will enable the family to reduce its coal consumption, thus releasing less pollutants into the atmosphere, which will have a positive impact on efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

locality named \u201cJalakanya\u201d with the intervention of Mahashakti Foundation. The lady standing at the extreme right raising her hand in the photo is Puspanjali. \r\n\r\nShe is a 38-year-old single woman living with her son, age 7 years. She belongs to a Below Poverty Line family (BPL), a segment living on less than a dollar a day. \r\n\r\nPuspanjali started her leaf plate business four years ago on a small scale and has been working hard to grow her business. She makes plates woven out of dry leaves at her house and local traders in the village come and collect them every week. She makes 1,000 to 1,500 plates each week. These plates are biodegradable, disposable, hygienic, and an inexpensive alternative to modern paper or plastic utensils. These are widely used by local food stalls and hotels to serve food. She gets her supply of leaves and bamboo twigs used for stitching from local sellers in the market and sun-dries them for two days to make them ready to be stitched. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the stock she buys from the local sellers is enough for her to make plates for one day and sell the next day.

Gouri is one of the members of this group. The lady standing extreme right raising her hand in the photo is Gouri. \r\n\r\nShe is 31 years old, living with her husband, one daughter, age 3 and one son, 8 months old. She has been involved in the leaf plate business for the last 10 years. She makes plates woven out of dry leaves at her house and local traders in the village come and collect them every week. She makes 1,000 to 1,500 plates in a week. These plates are biodegradable, disposable, hygienic, and an inexpensive alternative to modern paper or plastic utensils. These are widely used by local food stalls and hotels to serve food. \r\n\r\nGouri gets the supply of the leaves and bamboo twigs used for stitching from the local sellers in the market and sun-dries them for two days to make them ready to be stitched. Currently, the stock she buys from the local sellers is enough for her to make leaves for one day and sell the next day. She wants to have enough stock to support her business during the monsoon as well when she cannot get dry leaves. So the present loan will be used by her to buy more stock of leaves and bamboo twigs. This additional income will supplement her income during bad weather times when it might be difficult to dry leaves. \r\n\r\nGouri dreams of building a small concrete house for her family and giving a proper education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of her group are Pramila, Rabannama, Jaya and Lalita who are running a transporting business with leaf plate trading, a milk business, a tailoring centre and a laundry business, respectively.

The resources are there!\u201d \r\n\r\nFollowing the advice of her mom, an accountant, and her loan officer, Leah started using QuickBooks and created a detailed client database.

She has a permanent disability and having her own space has given her freedom over her schedule, to best serve clients and manage her disability. With the flexible schedule Leah has also been able to attend trade shows to keep up with trends in beauty products and services.

Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kithituni is a group of young women entrepreneurs engaged in a number of businesses ranging from farming to retail shops and clothing sales, among others.  Though their businesses are still viable, they saw an opportunity to expand by selling solar lamps to their community members.  In their rural setting where there is no electricity, promoting solar will be of double benefit since they will make some income from the sales as well as empower their community by encouraging green energy.  Families purchasing and using solar lamps will no longer have to buy or use kerosene or candles and hence can save money and improve their health.  The women's group will also be sustainable since profits will be ploughed back to grow their stock of solar lamps.  Their vision is to have a one-stop-shop for solar lamps in the region and also also create employment for their children.\n\nNicera, standing on the far left side, is a single mother who runs an electronics shop which she inherited from her father. She used this loan to purchase 24 lamps for resale and to get started in this business.  From the lamp sales she will be able to repay the loan and reinvest into the business.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3062.5,"image":{"id":1377283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase solar lamps for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Embu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.533333 37.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-07-02T14:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-01T14:30:08Z","loan_amount":6125,"lender_count":188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naodia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purity","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purity","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doreen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":525000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":6125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":43750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":510.42,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":43829.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390694386,"comment":null},{"amount":510.41,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":43829.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399940568,"comment":null},{"amount":510.42,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T09:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":43829.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410681387,"comment":null},{"amount":510.42,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":43829.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419987576,"comment":null},{"amount":510.41,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:35:56Z","rounded_local_amount":43829.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429639951,"comment":null},{"amount":510.42,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":43829.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867605,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T20:59:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":578207,"name":"Dagoberto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dagoberto, a native of El Salvador, arrived in the USA in 2000. He is married and has three children. \r\n\r\nAfter working in the construction industry for a year, he moved to Virginia where, since his arrival, he has been working in the field of heating and air conditioning. After Dagoberto acquired experience as a worker, foreman and supervisor, his boss suggested that he open his own company. As a result, Dagoberto created his own heating and air conditioning company. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the company is negotiating contracts with larger companies, aiming to diversifying its customer base.

He attended secondary school but would have liked to have studied Agronomy.\r\n\r\nWith much effort and above all the wish to get ahead, Simon works his land growing broad beans.  He spends about 10 hours daily at work above all because he\u2019s careful to keep his plants free from pests so that harvest will be good.  He believes he does well in his business because he\u2019s very dedicated and well-known by his customers.\r\n\r\nSim\u00f3n is very happy and grateful for the support Kiva lenders are providing because thanks to their help he will be able to buy supplies like fertilizer and manure for his plants to improve harvest for next year and improve his income.  In this way he will be able to continue striving every day to make his greatest dream reality: to finish building his house out of substantial materials.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1381462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy manure and fertilizer, among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-07-02T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-01T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simon Honorato","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3057.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819890,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-10T15:38:04Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T12:58:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":579176,"name":"Eugenia Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"DO\u00d1A EUGENIA DE 48 A\u00d1OS ES HABITANTE DE UNA COMUNIDAD RURAL UBICADA EN EL MUNICIPIO DE EL VIEJO CHINANDEGA.

is a 35-year-old businesswoman from Liberia.

She describes herself as a hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County. Buchanan is located by the sea.  It is well-known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating 'fufu,' a dish made from a cassava-based dough that is typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city speak Bassa, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nRuth has a table business, where she has been selling food items like Vita, oil, pepper, and onion, for the past three years.  She started in business by selling for her mother.  She works at her business from 8:00AM to 4:00PM each day.  Her greatest challenge in business is low income. She intends to use the loan to buy more Vita, oil, pepper, onion and similar items, to resell at her table.  She likes her business, because it helps her to support her home.  She hopes one day to own a house.  She wants to thank the Kiva lenders, in advance, for their help.

Only four are currently living at home and attending school. \r\n \r\nMarie has owned her own small shop business selling rice, soap, pepper, oil, etc for the past eight years.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more rice, soap, pepper, oil, etc to resell. On average, she works 10 hours at her business from Monday to Saturday.  She started her business with a small amount of money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by shared taxi.  She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge.

the age of 5, Wendell knew he had the knack to rap, but he never took music seriously until he reached 19, when he began recording and producing music. \u201cI knew I could do some nice things with it and open a lot of doors,\u201d he says, reflecting on his initial thoughts of rapping. He says now, \u201cMy goal is to try to make a million copies and sell to people; that\u2019s my goal.\u201d\r\n\r\nRapping about life, poverty, life-changing experiences, and general struggles under the name \u201cLock\u201d, Wendell records and produces his own music in his home. Determined to be successful, Wendell converted a former pool house in his back yard into a studio where he produces music off a Compaq computer his mother gave him. Earning $500 to $2,000 per show, the Baton Rouge native plans to be noticed by major labels. Wendell says he tries to perform three shows per month, but it has been slow. He says he could record and produce other rapper\u2019s music, and is currently taking courses in audio engineering for that, but says he needs to prioritize his wants and needs and is focusing on himself at the moment.\r\n\r\nNeeding funds to further his label, Wendell ventured to Accion Texas Inc. after a friend informed him about the nonprofit microlender. \u201cY\u2019all really helped me out a lot,\u201d he says about Accion.

Operating out of Pflugerville, Texas, the Miami native began her health and fitness business two years ago. Meeting with clients in their homes or in her studio, Alyassia offers her personal experience and expertise. As a mother of eight, Alyassia was never on the same fitness path as the rest of her family members but was able to transform herself from having 45 percent body fat to a healthy state. Her personal experience inspired her to obtain certification and become a certified professional trainer. As opposed to other trainers in the Austin area, Alyassia says she can relate to her clients, as she has not been a trainer \u2013 or, therefore, fit \u2013 all her life.\r\n\r\nThough Alyassia would love to hire an assistant, she needs to build her business first. To expand into a studio, purchase more equipment and market her business, Alyassia ventured to Accion Texas Inc. for a loan.

In this place they still maintain the Mazahua language, the typical dress - coloured outfits, and food such as huaraches [a fried dough base with toppings], quesadillas, sopes [a similar dish to huaraches], etc. Norma is a very sunny person but most of all, a very hard worker. She has dedicated herself body and soul to ensure the wellbeing of her children. Norma is 40 years old, she has been married to Javier for 23 years. Together they have created a family with three children who are currently studying at university.\r\n\r\nFor the last 15 years, Norma has been working renting furniture like chairs, tables and table linens for special events. She says that they began their business because her husband Javier was working in the town hall and one day he accompanied a person in charge of those events. It was there that they suggested to him that he begin this business because it was very good. It is going very well for them but at times they face two great challenges: competition with their neighbours and when their customers don't pay them in the end. For Norma this is a loss of profit but despite these difficulties she does not give up: \"Many people can begin the same business but there are few who know how to withstand the work that is required to start up the business\". Her customers are already acquaintances, she treats them very well so that they are instilled with confidence to come back again. In addition to the furniture rental, Norma is also starting to sell desserts as a result of courses that she has taken at an educational institution. \r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva and VisionFund for the opportunity to receive a loan.

This is 49-year-old Precious from Bulawayo. She is married and has one child. Precious runs a manufacturing business. She specializes in the manufacturing of school uniforms for various schools around town, and outside as well. The business has been in operation for two years. She says the main challenges faced are unavailability of raw materials and other material for use in her business. \r\n\r\nPrecious has requested a loan of $500 to order more cloth. She needs to buy the raw material in bulk so as to cut costs instead of buying in smaller quantities. The price for a roll of cloth costs around $120, which is much cheaper by at least 30 percent than when buying in smaller quantities. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to increase business capacity and fulfill outstanding orders. This will also enable her to operate profitably on the finished products when pricing them. In the future Precious plans to open a bigger factory as well as a shop selling her products.

She says that although she only sells for a half hour, her job starts very early at home, making her snacks and at 9:30 she goes to the school to set up her sales spot so that when the children come out at recess at 10:30 she starts to sell. With her husband's help, she also sells pork, chicarrones, longaniza, carne enchilada and carnitas once a week in order to make extra income.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her activity, in addition to earning her own money, is when people like her food. She says that she has customers in  Tuxtepec and Oaxaca who come to visit her when she is on vacation to buy her longaniza or carne enchilada and they take them to other places. This makes her happy.\r\n\r\nShe will invest this loan in buying beans, cheese, corn meal dough, chiles, eggs, oil, lettuce, tomatoes, gas and meat in order to make the snacks, and pork for the meat selling. In the future, she would like to open a butcher shop in her home, as well as improve her family's quality of life and build a house. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nJosefina- selling shoes\r\nTrinidad- selling chicken\r\nRosa Elena- selling groceries\r\nRubicela- selling clothes\r\nOfelia- selling groceries\r\nNicolas- growing corn\r\nAlejandra- selling shoes\r\nLeonor- blacksmithing \r\nCarmen- to sell chicken\r\nMar\u00eda- to sell shoes\r\nClaudia- to sell drinks\r\nAngela- to sell groceries \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7700,"image":{"id":1381773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy beans, cheese, corn meal dough, chiles, eggs,oil, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, gas  and pork.

Jane hopes that, in the future, she will be self independent. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":83.33,"image":{"id":1381513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer and seeds as well as maize and beans to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Maua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":138,"posted_date":"2013-07-03T14:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-02T14:00:32Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1425.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399922149,"comment":null},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1425.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410205081,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1425.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419969527,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1425.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429622037,"comment":null},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1425.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439847753,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-03T22:25:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
