Now that she is 30, she farms in order to support her family. The land in Huaripampa is favourable for sowing peas and potatoes. She has her own land where she sows these products. \"Every year I plant peas twice, and it goes well for me,\" she says. Her husband is the one who works the hardest in the fields. Every day, Felipe gets up at dawn to clear weeds and care for his plants. Their potato plantation is 30 minutes away from where they live; the long days of working and transporting the products are tiring.\r\nRocio is a strong, resolute woman. These qualities allow her to confront any and every situation in the fields. She has been able to provide an education for their three children, who are the main reason she keeps working. Rocio plans to sow one more bag of pea seeds this season; this will mean 40 bags harvested. This will be her thirteenth loan with MFP. In the previous loan cycles, she demonstrated her punctuality with repayments; she plans to continue to be punctual.

She has worked in a store business for several years.  This business is located in her house, in which she has a suitable space to place her products attractively for her customers.  Given that she is a responsible, hardworking, and charismatic  woman, many people prefer her and every day she has more customers who request her products.  With effort and dedication she has managed to support her little store, which is her main source of income.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to be able to give her children a different quality of life than what she had.  This is why she works hard to achieve her dream and be able to improve the situation in which she currently finds herself.  She has been thinking a lot about the way to make her business grow and she has come to the conclusion that it would be beneficial to stock her store in such a way as to be able to cover greater demand.\r\n\r\nFor this reason she has made the decision to request this loan of INTEGRAL to invest in buying store products wholesale, such as eggs, oil, cookies, rice, beans, \"churros\" [fried dough], soap, and other products that will attract more customers.\r\n\r\nShe trusts in Almighty God that in this way she will manage to get her family ahead and achieve her dream.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1006825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

She has a creative business through which she offers a cleaning service for rugs and living room and dining room furniture.  She started this business in 2006.  Before that she worked for companies in the city for ten years.  Although she is a psychologist by profession, when she learned about this business, which she carries out through her mother-in-law in the city of Medell\u00edn, she became keen and started working with a lot of enthusiasm which she still hasn't lost.  She has grown and strengthened her business in the city of Barranquilla and has invested in marketing the business through leaflets, ads in newspapers and telephone directories, mobile ads, etc.  Most of her customers are households who need cleaning and upholstering services for their living room and dining room furniture, drapes and rugs.  Gisela has the help of one worker who handles the cleaning machine and leaves the furniture clean, unstained and dry the same day.  This is something her customers really like.  With her great business vision, Gisela has taken part in cleaning fairs organized by chain stores and large stores in the city.  She will invest her loan in buying supplies and hiring staff to collect from customers who pay 30 days after they have received this service.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVeronica operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells personal products for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVeronica hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

Much like other families in the rural area, she fattens up livestock, after starting this business in 2000 with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  Today, Zivayda has two heads of dairy cows and five sheep in her business, and sales of milk products and meat allows her to earn about 5,000 som (KGS) per month.

Much like many other families in the rural area, she fattens up livestock, after starting this business in 2007 with a loan from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS). Today, Tadjikhan has two heads of dairy cows and four sheep in her business, and sales of milk products and meat allow her to earn about 5,000 som (KGS) per month.

Hernando is very satisfied with this business, with which he has managed to raise his family, which consists of his wife and three children, ages 13, 4, and 6 months. Now the carnival season is approaching, and it brings with it a great increase in his sales, and his working capital becomes insufficient to respond to this demand and offer competitive prices. This is the reason why he has turned to a Kiva loan, the first financing that he will receive from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which he will buy soft drinks and beverages, in addition to ingredients to prepare his foods. He will make these purchases for cash and in large volume, which will decrease a percentage of his costs and is precisely what motivates the success of his investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1006637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy soft

They grow some of their crops on 4 hectares of farmland that they inherited from their parents in their own community and some on a 1 hectare plot of land that they own in Paracti community.  They also own 3 dairy cows, 1 cow which is raised for meat and 2 calves.  Gregorio and his partner built a new house in which they invested all of their savings.

Specifically, she makes weavings with a power loom in a workshop that she has set up in the dining room of her house. \r\n\r\nShe says she began in this field when she worked for a company selling wool. Later they sent her for training where she did a course in weaving. In this way she learned the trade. Over time she realized that she liked handicrafts and she bought her first power loom so that she could work independently. Currently she makes woven pieces with different designs, as she weaves a lot. Additionally, she has two big customers who buy her handicrafts at wholesale and then resell them at retail. One of these customers is an exclusive clothing store in the city of Vi\u00f1a del Mar. She also makes pants, vests, t-shirts, and other innovative designs in women's clothing. She buys her merchandise, essentially \"wool\", in La Ligua (an area known for its artisanal textiles). One of her goals is to add-on to her house so that she can install her workshop in another area of the house. With this loan she will buy wholesale wool. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Luisa mentions that she has been separated for three years. Right now she lives with her two children who are 16 and 10 years old. Her personal dreams are to give her children a better quality education.

","en":"Faizullo is an active young guy and a family man with two children. He and his wife Manzura were engaged in the same business, but as Manzura is raising their small child, she is not currently working. For almost 15 years Faizullo has been making kebabs (a traditional meat dish) and selling them ready-to-eat near the entrance to the local hospital, where he has his diner-like spot. It's a crowded place with many visitors, and Faizullo sells over 150 kebabs daily, while also serving fish and beer. \r\n\r\nFaizullo first came to MDO Arvand, LLC six years ago, and since then has been taking loans continuously to expand his business. Every day Faizullo purchases raw ingredients at the market using his car. The vehicle has become worn out and requires daily expenditures, so Faizullo is planning to buy a new car as he cannot do without one. He has saved up some money on his own, and is requesting this loan to cover the balance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1011346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a new car for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-02-22T05:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-23T05:00:04Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faizullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":149.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":153.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":164.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":168.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":172.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":176.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":180.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":185.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":185.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":146.2,"local_amount":146.2,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":146.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095169,"comment":null},{"amount":149.69,"local_amount":149.69,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":149.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276919629,"comment":null},{"amount":153.27,"local_amount":153.27,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":153.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283197649,"comment":null},{"amount":156.93,"local_amount":156.93,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":156.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287197334,"comment":null},{"amount":160.69,"local_amount":160.69,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":160.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397392,"comment":null},{"amount":164.53,"local_amount":164.53,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:54Z","rounded_local_amount":164.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452217,"comment":null},{"amount":168.46,"local_amount":168.46,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":168.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308212470,"comment":null},{"amount":172.48,"local_amount":172.48,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":172.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443223,"comment":null},{"amount":727.75,"local_amount":727.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":727.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048196,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-21T14:38:36Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:19:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395050,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a fishing business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 40,000 through NWTF to purchase additional fishing net and other fishing equipment for her fishing business.\r\n\r\nNenita has been in this business for five years.

She tells us that, some years ago, she decided to start her own business selling soft drinks and Mexican snacks (empanadas, tostadas, fried tacos and picadas) because she wanted to support her husband with their household expenses and enjoy a better quality of life.  Adela tells us that she rented a small sales location next to the elementary school and this is where she sells her soft drinks and sweet treats.  She also sells Mexican snacks (empanadas, tostadas, fried tacos and picadas).  During recess she puts her food on a table to sell.  She says that her business is doing well because the children buy their breakfast there and she is already popular with the students.  \r\n\r\nAdela needs this loan to buy corn dough, tortillas, oil, cheese, meat, soft drinks, juice, cream, disposable plates and candies.

Con su credikiva lograr\u00e1 una inversi\u00f3n exitosa, porque lo hace sobre pedidos,  que garantizan una rotaci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida de sus ventas y con descuentos especiales que agregan valor a su venta. Su meta mas adelante es tener su propia casa y para disminuir los gastos de arriendo del hogar y disfrutar de mayor sosiego familiar. ","en":"56-year-old Teresa is a married woman who has two children aged 28 and 36.  She has been selling cosmetics in Atl\u00e1ntico department for 10 years and used to carry out the same business when she lived in the country's capital city.  Teresa currently lives together with her husband as her two children are living in other cities in Colombia.  She makes income from her own business selling perfume and vegetables to a market consisting of housewives and small businesses.  She makes her sales for cash and on credit.  As her customer base continues to grow, her working capital is not enough to respond to her buyers in a timely manner.  For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy vegetables and a variety of merchandise including cosmetics and perfume.  She has specialized product catalogs which she uses to promote and sell her products.  Teresa will make a successful investment with her Kiva loan because she sells to order.  This guarantees her a quick sales turnover and she enjoys special discounts which makes her more profits on her sales.  Her goal for the future is to own her own home so that she can reduce her rental expenses and live more peacefully with her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1006640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy
