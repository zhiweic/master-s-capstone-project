They have two children together, Axel and Milena, and live in the city of Coronel Oviedo. \r\n\r\nSilvio has been working in sales for more than 11 years now. He started as a street vendor with small boxes of knit tops, t-shirts, shorts, hosiery, toys, cosmetics, and other products. His business grew from this small start. Now he has his business in a very strategic location in the city, which is very busy. His spouse Fatima works there, while he continues to work as a traveling salesman in his own vehicle, with a good amount of products. He says that the work is very demanding but that it is worth the effort, since it is in this way that he was able to get his own home and support his family. \r\n\r\nHe is asking for this loan to invest it in buying knit tops, t-shirts, shorts, hosiery, toys, cosmetics, and other products, so that he continues having a good variety of products to offer his customers.

Se cas\u00f3 y se dedic\u00f3 a los quehaceres de su hogar, sin embargo, luego de muchos a\u00f1os de matrimonio su esposo con quien tuvo cuatro hijos, se fue de la casa sin previo aviso ni ninguna explicaci\u00f3n hace dos a\u00f1os. Para ella fue muy dif\u00edcil sobrellevar esta prueba, pues ten\u00eda que comenzar a valerse por s\u00ed sola. Sus hijos de 34, 30, 27 y 24 a\u00f1os cada uno la animaron para que emprenda con nuevos retos y con quienes comparte su tiempo libre. Ahora vive sola en Los Bancos un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Pichincha, una de las provincias  m\u00e1s grandes en la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Este cant\u00f3n se encuentra a pocos kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de Quito, y tiene diversidad de bosques, adem\u00e1s sus barrios est\u00e1n poblados con gente amable y costumbres propias de esta ciudad en donde tambi\u00e9n se encuentran establecidas varias microempresas administradas por los emprendedores que luchan por hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os cada d\u00eda. Otras de las actividades sobresalientes son la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda, produciendo abundantes cultivos que luego son comercializados para distribuirse hacia muchas provincias. Tambi\u00e9n posee varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como cascadas, r\u00edos, senderos, balnearios en donde el turista es atra\u00eddo por los deportes de aventura que se venden all\u00ed con seguridad garantizada. Carmen forma parte de esta poblaci\u00f3n y ha desarrollado su esp\u00edritu emprendedor tambi\u00e9n pensando en ser un protagonista del crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de su ciudad y del pa\u00eds.\nPoco antes de que su esposo se fuera, hace 4 a\u00f1os, establecieron una tienda de productos de primera necesidad en su hogar que se encuentra ubicado en un lugar estrat\u00e9gico para atender varias familias. Su esposo le ayudaba en la tienda mientras ella atend\u00eda los quehaceres del hogar. Hace 2 a\u00f1os ella se qued\u00f3 sola con el negocio y ha hecho que crezca el n\u00famero de clientes y por ende las ventas. Invierte en esta actividad al menos 10 horas, desde que sale el sol, hasta altas horas en la noche, para as\u00ed satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes. Los ingresos que este negocio le generan le ayudan a sustentar sus necesidades pero ahora requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para realizar varios arreglos en su casa y as\u00ed poder vivir con una mejor calidad de vida, pues los cambios de clima causan inestabilidad en la infraestructura de su casa. Carmen espera que con los arreglos que realice en su casa pueda ampliar el espacio que dedica a la tienda y as\u00ed ampliar la oferta de productos. Esta mujer de naturaleza emprendedora agradece a todos quienes aportan la financiaci\u00f3n de este sue\u00f1o.","en":"Carmen is a 58-year-old woman who was born in Ibarra, a city located in Northern Ecuador. Since she was young, she left the city with her family and started working with her parents, since the basic education she received was not useful to find a job outside the city.\r\n\r\nCarmen got married and became a housewife. After many years of marriage, her husband, father of her four children, left without a reason. This happened two years ago. This was a difficult test for her, since she was going to have to make a living on her own. Her children, aged 34, 30, 27 and 24, and with who she spends her free time, encouraged her to embrace new challenges. She is now living alone in Los Bancos, a canton that belongs to Pichincha province, one of the most populated in Ecuador. This canton is located close to Quito and has numerous forests. Its neighborhoods are full of kind people that keep their traditions and it also has numerous small companies run by entrepreneurial people that struggle every day to make their dreams come true. Other common activities are agriculture and livestock farming, and the wide variety of produce are sold and distributed to many provinces. The region has also numerous touristic attractions such as waterfalls, rivers, paths and water parks. It is popular also because of the different adventure sports that are offered with the proper security standards.\r\n\r\nCarmen is an inhabitant of this locality and has developed an entrepreneurial spirit. She wants to be part of her city\u2019s and country\u2019s economic growth. Just before her husband left, they opened a grocery store at home, located on a strategic location, accessible to surrounding families. Her husband used to help her in the store while she took care of the household chores. Two years ago, she was left alone to take care of the store and has managed to increase the number of customers and thus the sales. She works at least ten hours, from early in the morning until late at night, in order to serve her customers. The income from this business helps her to make a living, but she needs a loan to make some improvements to her house and live a better life, since the changing weather affects her house\u2019s structures. Carmen expects that these improvements will result in more space for her store and in more storage capacity. This enterprising woman wants to thank all of those who are contributing to financing this dream."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":780.65,"image":{"id":1322184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to make some improvements to her house, where she has a grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-27T23:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-26T23:00:01Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":93.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":95.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":97.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":99.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.91,"local_amount":73.37,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":73.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524930,"comment":null},{"amount":82.83,"local_amount":82.23,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":82.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133235,"comment":null},{"amount":83.83,"local_amount":83.22,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":83.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313774,"comment":null},{"amount":86.01,"local_amount":85.39,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":86.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565379,"comment":null},{"amount":87.18,"local_amount":86.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":87.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814418,"comment":null},{"amount":88.91,"local_amount":88.26,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:43Z","rounded_local_amount":88.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320591,"comment":null},{"amount":91.02,"local_amount":90.36,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":91.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856281,"comment":null},{"amount":92.45,"local_amount":91.78,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":92.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059857,"comment":null},{"amount":94.51,"local_amount":93.83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":94.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995204,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T01:22:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":542218,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of three children, Grace works hard to support her family.

is 31 years old and is from the small village of Mtskheta district.  He is married and lives with his wife and two children (9 and 11 years old). Soso requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success.  His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. Soso\u2019s wife milks the cow and produces cheese for selling. They also have three pigs. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \r\n\r\nSoso requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of a business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor.  These people do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d  because of low income. Soso plans to start his own business.\r\nThe place in which he lives is very conducive to opening a fast food stall, where he will sell Doner (similar to kabobs). With the received credit, Soso will purchase the stock of raw materials to make doner and a refrigerator for juices.

Five years ago she decided to get a means of livelihood of her own. That's why she bought a photocopier and soon thereafter she rented a small space in the town centre. It is very close to several educational institutions and there she attracts a larger number of customers. Every morning she heads out to her store and makes copies according to the orders she gets, and that's how she earns the income that her family needs. She gets help from her children on occasion.

Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros.

She has attended secondary school but did not have the opportunity to continue her studies at the university as she has worked since she was very young and she married Jos\u00e9, who is 67 years old and works as a driver. They have one child who lives on his own. Lucinda lives in the Rio Verde area, which is a historic area of Santo Domingo, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo of the \u201cTsachilas\u201d, a province in Ecuador. In the last few years this area has grown quite a bit. The capital is a city, which is known for its delicious fruits and for the food that is prepared there. There is also a lot of trade, as it is becoming a commercial center for the mountain and coastal regions of the country. Also, there are a lot of tourist attractions as it has a temperate climate. Many local and international tourists visit here. This is why most of the people are business people or they offer services for the locals or the tourists.\r\nLucinda, three years ago, started a stationary business in order to help her husband with the household expenses. She is able to do this business along with her housework, as this business is located in her house. Lucinda offers a variety of products for customers of all ages. She also sells candies and other fresh grocery items in order to increase her sales. She attends to her customers many hours of the day. Her business is stagnant because she doesn\u2019t have financial support. Thanks to some of her friends who belong to a credit group, she was able to learn about the services offered by the Alternative Foundation. She decided to join them in order to ask for a personal loan in order to buy more supplies for her business.

Joseph joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough food for the family and use the increased profits to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nJoseph reports that before One Acre Fund, he was able to grow about three bags of maize per half acre, but with his One Acre Fund input loan during Long Rains 2012, he harvested 8 bags per half acre! He plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future. During the 2013 Long Rains season, each group member will receive half an acre of agricultural inputs on credit.

is 40 years old. He lives in the village of Klde, Akhaltsikhe district, with his wife, Shorena, and three children who are going to school. Malkhaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. They own a plot of land. Malkhaz cultivates the land and plants potatoes and maize. Harvested products are sold locally at the markets and the family gets a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nMalkhaz requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Malkhaz wants to open a shoe shop.

is a 30-year-old married man who has four children living in Kyenjojo, Uganda. He operates a retail shop, where he has spent five years. This has helped him to earn income, which he has used to satisfy his family's needs. He also does farming on a large scale.

Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides that, they have 0.3 hectares of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested nuts and cheese locally at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nSvetlana requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Svetlana will begin a trade in clothing. She plans to purchase clothing from the wholesalers and then resell it at a higher price. This will increase the income of the family.

She lives in the small village of the Martvili district with her 36-year-old son. \r\n\r\nLamara requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have a pig and 1.6 hectares of agricultural land, where 100 nut trees are grown. Besides, her son works as an artisan and gets a small income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLamara requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. With the received credit, Lamara will purchase a milking cow. After purchasing the cow, she will be able to produce dairy products for selling. This will increase the income of the family.

is 45-year-old Rugiatu. She is married and has 5 children ages 24, 22, 18, 16 and 13 years. In 1998, Rugiatu established her local foodstuffs business selling garie (cassava flakes) and palm oil. She began her business because she wants to help her husband to take care of the home. Her business is located in the outskirts and her main customers are general community people. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 700,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 4,500,000 SLL.

is 32 years old and a married mother of one child, age ten years. She runs a pharmacy in Waterloo, in the eastern area in Sierra Leone. Her child is currently attending school. Her husband is a driver, but his income is not enough to support the family.\r\n\r\nShe's been in this business for five years and sells injection medicine, blood tonics, and anti-malarial drugs. At present, her challenge is with price inflation.\r\n\r\nMariama requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone Microfinance Company Limited to purchase more injection medicine, blood tonics, and anti-malarial drugs.

is 52-year-old Abu-Bakarr. He is married and has three children, 18, 15, and 12 years old. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Abu-Bakarr established his rice and timber business. He began his business because he was not educated. His business is located in the outskirts and his main customers are general community people. Working seven days per week and 12 hours per day, Abu-Bakarr earns about SLL 500,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nAbu-Bakarr would like a loan in the amount of SLL 3,000,000.

This is 51-year-old Lita from Harare. She is married with four children; two attend school. She also cares for two dependents. \r\n\r\nLita runs a poultry project and sells chickens; she has been in business for three years.

Thus Lily will continue working and making an effort to achieve her dream of having her own house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1322216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy dresses for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-28T21:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-27T21:40:17Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lily Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":206.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":207.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":218.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":224},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":235.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":241.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":251.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":262.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":271.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":282.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":292.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":304.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.07,"local_amount":206.99,"processed_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":209.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776499,"comment":null},{"amount":81.24,"local_amount":207.43,"processed_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":210.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483419,"comment":null},{"amount":85.7,"local_amount":218.8,"processed_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":221.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889457,"comment":null},{"amount":87.73,"local_amount":224,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":227.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664356,"comment":null},{"amount":92.22,"local_amount":235.45,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":238.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775748,"comment":null},{"amount":94.73,"local_amount":241.87,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":245.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779084,"comment":null},{"amount":98.42,"local_amount":251.28,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":254.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054261,"comment":null},{"amount":102.96,"local_amount":262.86,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":266.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819187,"comment":null},{"amount":450.93,"local_amount":1151.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1167.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472158,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T02:24:50Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541581,"name":"Dative","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dative is 38 years old.

His business is the only place in the street that sells shoes which is an advantage for him over his competitors among the street vendors.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, he will rent a more permanent kiosk in the nearby market where he can run his business and add a greater variety of shoe types to his inventory. By doing so, he hopes to increase his income for the family and children's education. Suwandi will use this loan to increase the capital available to buy shoes and sandals.\r\n\r\nSuwandi expects to be able to grow his business and generate more income which will allow him to have some savings in order to send both of his children to higher education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2447.29,"image":{"id":1318145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Enkhbold, 28 years-old, lives with his family in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. In 2004, he worked as a driver for a private business entity and in 2005, he went to Korea on a three year employment contract. After his return, he began working as a taxi driver at another private business. His wife used to work as a saleswoman at a store and recently went on maternity leave. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. He is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT in order to purchase insulation and building materials such as fiber glass, foam, bricks and plants. As a result, the family will live in more comfortable and warm place.

Maritza vive junto a su familia en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una ciudad que cuenta un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Sus varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros y la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nMaritza ha visto la necesidad de aportar en su hogar para la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos y cubrir los gastos b\u00e1sicos de la casa, por lo que hace dos a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 a comercializar cosm\u00e9ticos por cuenta propia gracias al consejo de amigos. Para no descuidar los quehaceres del hogar y el apoyo que ella brinda a sus hijos con sus tareas, trabaja apenas 3 horas en las que tiene que arregl\u00e1rselas para entregar pedidos y ofrecer sus productos. Maritza desea invertir en un negocio fijo en el que pueda al mismo tiempo atender los quehaceres del hogar y a sus hijos, es por esto que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la adecuaci\u00f3n de un local para instalar un restaurante de comida t\u00edpica  de la zona que ella tan bien prepara con el saz\u00f3n \u00fanico de su familia. El mayor obst\u00e1culo que le ha impedido emprender en este negocio antes, ha sido la falta de capital, obst\u00e1culo que ahora es derribado gracias al apoyo de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y Kiva que adem\u00e1s de apoyo, confianza y agilidad, dan la oportunidad a otras personas alrededor del mundo para ser parte de este sue\u00f1o.

She was only able to finish primary school, and from a very young age Maritza has worked hard to help her family make ends meet. She and her partner, Augusto, have two children and live in their own home. Maritza\u2019s children are in school, and she hopes to be able to support them in their studies all the way through to the completion of professional degrees. \r\n\r\nMaritza and her family live in the parish of R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, which is located in the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. The city of R\u00edo Verde has a growing business sector, and is also a centrally located zone that connects the mountainous and coastal regions of the country. With a warm climate and many tourist attractions, R\u00edo Verde has become a popular destination for foreign and Ecuadoran tourists. With the influx of tourism, the people of R\u00edo Verde have adapted and learned various trades and crafts that both support and benefit from the tourist industry. \r\n\r\nIn response to growing education and household costs, Maritza started a business selling cosmetics at the suggestion of some of her friends. As a complement to her household duties and time spent with her kids, Maritza works an average of three hours every day managing client orders, delivering products to customers and sharing her products with prospective clients. Ultimately, Maritza wants to invest in a stable business that will allow her to balance the personal and professional aspects of life. With her goals in mind, Maritza is requesting this loan, and she plans to use the support from the loan to set up her own small restaurant where she can prepare delicious food dishes that draw on her family\u2019s unique recipes, flavor and tradition.\r\n\r\nThe greatest challenge that has impeded Maritza\u2019s progress in this business endeavor up until now is her lack of access to startup capital and funds. She is very grateful for the support and confidence she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva, and for the support they provide in helping people all over the world fulfill their dreams. When she is able to get her restaurant up and running, Maritza does not plan to stop selling cosmetics, but rather to install a display case for her products in the new restaurant in hopes of combining her two businesses and improving her family\u2019s quality of life.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":841.25,"image":{"id":1322133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to set up a display case for her cosmetics and undertake the new challenge of opening up a small restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-29T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-28T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maritza  Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1056,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":107.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":109.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":111.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":113.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":115.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.27,"local_amount":88.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":90.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133249,"comment":null},{"amount":100.93,"local_amount":99.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313788,"comment":null},{"amount":103.49,"local_amount":101.66,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":103.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565393,"comment":null},{"amount":104.96,"local_amount":103.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":104.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814432,"comment":null},{"amount":107.05,"local_amount":105.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":107.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320604,"comment":null},{"amount":109.51,"local_amount":107.58,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":109.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856294,"comment":null},{"amount":111.31,"local_amount":109.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":111.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059869,"comment":null},{"amount":113.73,"local_amount":111.72,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":113.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995213,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T09:34:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":542699,"name":"Pamoja Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emanuel, who is in his 20s, is a married man staying together with his wife.

He will also hire someone to build the shelf and paint his store. This is why he is so glad for the financial support that he is receiving, because it will help him to continue expanding his business.

He is married and lives with his wife, two children and mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Gocha has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is Gocha\u2019s small monthly income working as a baker at local bakery. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGocha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Gocha will rent a bakery. He plans to start his own bakery and increase the income of the family. He has chosen a commercial space, which is in very crowded area, so he hopes that the business will be profitable.

He began his business because he did not go to school so he was trained in business. He works at the business from 7:30 am to 6:00 pm, 7 days per week. He says that the main challenges to his business are transportation and price inflation of goods.\r\n\r\nYusufu requires a loan in order to buy more ground nuts, palm oil and beans. He hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow him to educate his children and increase his business. In the future, Yusufu plans to buy a plot of land. He thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":992.3,"image":{"id":1321645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more ground nuts, palm oil and beans.

is 37-year-old Adam.  He is married and has two children, aged 8 and 2 years. In 2000, Adam  established his stationery business. He began his business as a means of generating revenue.

is 36 years old. She lives in the Borjomi District with her 43-year-old husband, Jumber, and three children who are going to school. Irma requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the mini-bus that they own. Jumber gets private orders and he transports different things.\r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Irma will purchase potatoes at the wholesale price from Akhalkalaki district, bring it to Borjomi and sell it with a price markup among their villagers. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1321715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to trade with potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Borjomi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-29T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-28T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":85.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":88.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":90.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":92.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":95.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.71,"local_amount":75.71,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":75.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570432,"comment":null},{"amount":74.27,"local_amount":74.27,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":74.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969073,"comment":null},{"amount":75.41,"local_amount":75.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":75.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749492,"comment":null},{"amount":78.01,"local_amount":78.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":78.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613400,"comment":null},{"amount":79.37,"local_amount":79.37,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":79.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857118,"comment":null},{"amount":81.42,"local_amount":81.42,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":81.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133772,"comment":null},{"amount":535.81,"local_amount":535.81,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":535.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107363,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T15:25:14Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:40:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":542805,"name":"Saribek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saribek is 44 years old and lives in Sevan city with his wife.
