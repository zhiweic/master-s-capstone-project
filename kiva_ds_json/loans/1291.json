A few years ago, Caroline started her own business to support farmers and their employees in the flower and tea-growing region of the Rift Valley and Western Kenya, where she has improved the lives of thousands by providing access to sustainable energy products that are needed within local communities.\n\nCaroline\u2019s product line now includes solar energy solutions, as well as improved cook stoves, which she and her small team sell on farms, in factories, savings and credit cooperatives, and in open-air markets.  The team also conducts trainings and live demos for community members to see the positive aspects of solar when compared to traditional energy sources such as candles, kerosene, and disposable batteries.  With years of experience selling a variety of solar products and building a reputation in her community, Caroline began working with One Degree\u2019s team in Kenya in 2012 after hearing about BrightBox, a new solar energy kit that powers lights, phones, and radios.  During initial demos, customers would get excited when seeing BrightBox lights in action; Caroline acted quickly as an entrepreneur. \n\nSince April 2013, Caroline has already sold over 230 BrightBox kits to her customers.  She already has requests for many more, which she would like to provide before the holidays.  While happy with her initial success, Caroline has been selling to customers on a regular cash basis, while many others cannot afford to pay upfront.  These same customers are often stuck spending $10-$15 per month - a considerable portion of their income - on lighting and phone charging.\n\nTo break this cycle and provide renewable energy to these customers, Caroline would like to start offering flexible payment terms to those who need it most, while also increasing her inventory on hand to serve more customers.  She seeks support from Kiva lenders to make this happen.\n\nCaroline will use funds for 170 units of Bright Boxes solar kits, which will energize and empower households across her region.  Customers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them upfront or over several months.  Since they are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4-5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. With your help, Caroline will help families eliminate energy expenses, improve safety, and allow their children to read into the night."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":14550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1486781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for solar energy systems and offer financing plans to lower-income farmers and farm employees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T21:30:05Z","loan_amount":14550,"lender_count":359,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":14550,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":14550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":14550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T18:46:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":644287,"name":"Ada De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Ada de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, es una persona soltera, estudio hasta noveno grado.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 28 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for one-quarter acre of maize and one-quarter acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Everline is pictured on the right of the Madete Kaviri Group with her hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEverline is a reliable member of the community. She is married with seven children. Everline is 35 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 25 years to support her family. In addition to this, she is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group, prayer group, and burial committee. She described her harvest last year as not being with One Acre Fund. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoy the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEverline joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. She joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school. Because she likes being a leader, and she is an active community member, Everline wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Everline has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Everline's life because she has more farm training and more farm group support and was able to feed the family. In the future, Everline hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school, repair the home, save for the future, and buy a goat.  \r\n\r\nEverline and the Madete Kaviri Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1487097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T21:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T21:50:09Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":149772,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149772}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-05T02:43:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643463,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Margret is single with three children and all her children go to school.

She graduated from 6th Grade Primary School before she started working.  Herminia is a professional seamstress that has been successfully managing her small business in Ciudad Vieja in the Sacatep\u00e9quez region of Guatemala.  Her top-selling items are dresses for the first communion and for \u2018Quincea\u00f1eras\u00b4 (a traditional 15th birthday celebration).

Her dream is to travel to the United States of America to explore a different world.\n\nHerminia wants to invest her loan money in two new sewing machines, fabric, accessories, and mannequins.  She is very innovative when it comes to new strategies, and wants to explore new markets and products, such as special covers for chairs.

Credit is not generally available to women with businesses of this size, so an important program element is an appropriately-sized business loan.  Women also receive coaching in leadership, economic and gender empowerment, and renegotiating household power relationships.

Her goal in the STARZ Program is to increase her monthly profits to approximately $970 US in the next year.  To do this, she has requested this loan of 30,000 Guatemalan Quetzales, with repayments over 36 months.

Later, Chef D managed a national restaurant chain, and was promoted to product development, leading the execution of three of the corporation\u2019s popular menu concepts.\n\n\nIn January 2011, after years of working in the corporate world and learning the ins and outs of the industry, Chef D decided he wanted to return to running his own business. In May of that year, Chef D opened \u201cIt\u2019s a Wrap Caf\u00e9\u201d, an innovative establishment offering healthy and affordable fare in his hometown of Plainfield, New Jersey.\n\n\nNow, Chef D\u2019s catering business spans the New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey states. The first volume of his autobiography, aptly titled \u201cJack of All Trades: Mastered by One,\u201d hits stores soon\u2014as does an episode on Food Network featuring his restaurant and it\u2019s noble work in the community during the devastation of Hurricane Sandy last year.\n\n\nAs many who meet him will attest, Chef D is passionate about what he does, and what he does is provide value for his customers. He cares about people, and that is what sets It\u2019s a Wrap and his other ventures apart from the competition.\n\n\nA graduate of Johnson and Wales University, Chef D is passionate and dynamic\u2014the perfect personality for a business owner. He credits his childhood, when he would frequent banquet halls, as his inspiration for pursuing this career path. And that path involves big dreams.\n\n\nLooking forward, Chef D\u2019s goals involve expanding the catering and retail side of the restaurant, and opening new storefront locations. A repeat borrower in good standing with the Intersect Fund, Chef D needs working capital to help to complete rebranding efforts and allow further expansion of the business. The funds from this loan will go toward creating a new logo for the company and renovating the current storefront location.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1479746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To rebrand and renovate this young entrepreneur's cafe and catering business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Plainfield","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":316,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T00:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T00:30:07Z","loan_amount":5250,"lender_count":163,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":5250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.61},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.79},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.32},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T22:46:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641163,"name":"Sathi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sathi is a rural married woman of 27 years, the mother of a daughter.

As an active member in his community, Salim also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative and he wants to help more farmers.  Salim plans on using future profits from the harvest to save for the future and buy a goat.  He believes that his life will improve by working with One Acre Fund because he has more farm training and has more farm group support.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nSalim and the Bidii Farmers Ass Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is 1 additional group leader in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.

He started this activity at a young age and later continued in an independent manner thanks to a couple of plots of land his parents gave him when his daughter was born.  <br \/><br \/>Presently he has 2 hectares of land where he grows organic cocoa, coffee and other profitable products. His plots are very fertile which helps him obtain a high production.  He comments that in spite of the constant adversities like the constant rains that soak his region Juan sees no inconvenience and continues with his labors motivated by his family.<br \/><br \/>The same as many of the farmers in the area he uses a variety of means to reap high commercial quality fruits. Principally he uses organic fertilizer such as guano which he buys wholesale by the bag. One of his main long term goals is to improve the materials used in constructing his home hoping to improve their quality of living. <br \/><br \/>This is the first loan that Juan has requested from Kiva and he thanks the lenders for the opportunity they are providing him. At this time he is asking  for 1,500 PEN to buy an adjoining plot of land to expand his plantation."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1488769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She has been involved in business her entire life, being able to stay in school only through the sixth grade. When she could no longer keep studying, she found herself obliged to engage fully in her work. She is married and her husband works hard on a farm bordering the town.\r\n\r\nEvery morning she takes the bus seven km across town. While she is at work, their two children go to school.  Her business is selling food. She rents a stand at a bus terminal and has seven years of experience in this work. Before, she sold pupusas (a typical Salvadoran meat pie) out of her house, but when she had the chance to grow, she chose to get a wider variety of products and move across town.\r\n\r\nShe learned this business from her mother. She works every day, Monday to Sunday, from 6:00 am until 3:00 pm.

At the moment, she doesn't have the resources to make these improvements, which is why she decided to request a loan.

She is both an employee and the owner of her own business. Her partner works as a mechanic at a bodywork and painting shop, and together their work manages to sustain the family. They have three children in school.\r\n\r\nReina is an employee at a business that sells fried chicken. She's been there two years and receives a salary of $180 per month. She says the work pays poorly, but she doesn't currently have the luxury of not working. Employment in the country is a difficult situation. So as another source of income, she also makes and sews clothing. Her neighbors need the service, and she takes advantage of the opportunity by using the sewing lessons she learned from her mother.

He sows crops such as onions & potatoes (among others) for a living.  This line of work pays well, but is seasonal, and can be quite finicky; for example, if the soil isn't fertilized in time, the harvest could be ruined.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Salohiddin needs fertilizer himself.  He's specifically in need of mineral fertilizers, but lacks the money to buy them.

Crupskaya is currently attending the Universidad Domingo Savio, working towards her degree. She plans to graduate in January 2015 but without a loan from Vittana, she fears that she will need to defer her graduation. With this loan, Crupskaya plans to buy her schoolbooks. Up until now, she has been managing to get by without them but it has become a challenge. With books and school supplies, she feels she will be able to get better grades. In addition to her responsibilities at school, Crupskaya currently has a job in technical support. She works 30 hours a week and earns $7 a day. With a degree in systems engineering, she expects to earn $15 a day. Because Crupskaya's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education, her parents never had the chance to increase their earning potential. Growing up, the family's finances were always tight.

Her challenges are insufficient funds and livestock diseases.\r\n\r\nDorca chose Juhudi Kilimo because they offer low interest rates for their loans.

She is married and is the mother of three children who live under her roof.  They are school-aged, in the community school.  She didn\u2019t have the opportunity to finish elementary school, and so she only finished second grade. This was due to a lack of economic support from her parents, because of their scarce economic resources.  For ten years, she has worked in the business of coffee farming, learning it from her parents as the family business.  It was the means of income for her family in her childhood, and she is still doing it today.  Besides growing coffee, she also works growing corn and beans on a plot of land she got thanks to a purchase her husband made a few years ago.
