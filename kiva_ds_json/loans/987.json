She lives with William, her husband of 10 years.  They have three children, Estefan\u00eda, Josu\u00e9 and Jean Carlos, who she cares for in her own house located in Usibamba.  Her motto is constant work.  She prepares the food she\u2019ll sell at her local school very early in the morning.  She opened a small business there two years ago selling snacks, soft-drinks and home-made food to students and teachers who visit Yanet during recess.

has raised two children. Her daughter is married and her son is studying. \r\n\r\nIn the search of a source of income for the family, Tamara started working with livestock breeding in 1976. After having started with 5,000 som (KGS), the farm today brings in around 8,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy products and from re-selling of livestock. Thanks to Tamara's hard work, the number of livestock today counts 3 dairy cows, 18 sheep and 1 horse. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Tamara turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 55,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of livestock. The purpose of the loan is to purchase two bulls. Tamara plans to invest the income in further increasing the number of livestock. In the future, according to the plans that Tamara shared with us, she dreams of purchasing an apartment in the city of Karakol."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":587.5,"image":{"id":1230551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase 2 bulls for fattening and reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sary-Dobo village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-11-05T23:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-05T23:20:08Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":6875,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6928.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459700,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":6875,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6928.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458833,"comment":null},{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":6875,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6928.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495382,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":6875,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6928.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776903,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T02:51:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492495,"name":"Ararati Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Masika est membre du groupement d\u2019affaire Ararati, elle est mari\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e d\u2019environ 46 ans et m\u00e8re de 7 enfants.

Back then she did not have a point of sale, and the income was very small. \r\n\r\nZilola had the strength and the patience to increase her turnover through activities and support from her husband and relatives.

She and her husband made possible building their house with substantial materials on a piece of land their parents passed down to them.  \r\n\r\nForced to leave the countryside where she worked growing coffee and cocoa beans among others, she arrived in the city seeking help for her daughter\u2019s illness.  She opted for buying a mototaxi on credit to start a new life.  Fortunately, based on effort and extra work hours they met all their obligations and this motivated them to continue with still more dedication.  One of the objectives they have in mind is to acquire a second vehicle and do longer routes because demand for transportation by local residents is increasing and this could lead to her reaching her future dream of owning a grocery store.\r\n\r\nLike all vehicles it sometimes has breakdowns which are why she wants to have additional money to counteract the inconveniences caused by them.

Her children often slept without having any food. \r\n\r\nWhen Kashf\u2019s loan officers found Shahida in these circumstances they informed her about microfinance and the facilities they had to offer. The couple decided to take a loan so she could start her work. She said she remembered doing it with her mother in her childhood and was hopeful that the work would help them fight poverty.

They have been working together with the sole aim of offering their little ones, Jos\u00e9, Jhon and Anelhy, a good education that in the future will allow them to face life with fewer hardships than they had. \r\n\r\nTemporarily, they occupy a rented home, with the desire of also owning their own home in the future. In order to improve their finances, she decided, with Juan, who until that time had been working as in an employee in an auto repair shop, to have their own business in order to ensure their family's livelihood. \r\n\r\nThis is how they have had a repair shop for various vehicles for three years, and alongside that, a well-stocked spare parts store that she runs. Forming a two-person team, they work with the aim of making the business grow in the future. She also says that working together with Juan to get ahead in life, makes their marital happiness grow.

is 37 years old; she started a business selling milk last year. Every morning, she milks her three cows and prepares gallons of milk that her son takes to the market, but business was not always this smooth. A year back, Shameem had only one cow. Her husband works as a welder whose income is not sufficient to meet the needs of a family of five. \r\n\r\nLife was difficult for the family, as expenses were high and income was minimum. The family was in such circumstances when Kashf\u2019s loan officer found Shameem. After informing her about the organization's services, the loan officer discussed different business prospects for Shameem.

He lives in the company of his wife, with whom he has four children they care for in the house they acquired in their community 24 years ago.  Since he was very young he has made a living in agriculture; his family have been peasants for many generations.  He has farming land in Chuqui and Matar\u00e1, where he was born.  There he plants corn, beans, and potatoes of every variety.  When the planting season begins he spends the day immersed in the field and nature, preparing the earth for the seed, caring for the growth of the food, and providing a lot of love.\r\n\r\nHe has more than 20 years of experience in the food business.  Thanks to this he has a little house with his wife 25 minutes from the nearby city where he sells and makes his earnings, although he says that during times of plenty he sells his harvest in the city of Huancayo where he gets more profit.

She has been in the business of stitching since many years. She has expertise in the field of stitching and is famous in making attractive designs.  But Shabana\u2019s business was not as successful in the past years as she had little resources.  Her five children were barely provided with basic necessities as their father was the sole bread earner and did not make sufficient income to support the family\u2019s growing needs.

Lorpu's husband is a contractor, and he gave her the initial capital to start her business. Lorpu has a warehouse in her community, where she has been selling coal for the past nine years. A difficulty she faces is transporting the coal from the bush to Monrovia. She makes a profit when she sells, because she has customers who are always waiting to buy coal wholesale, after it has been transported to Monrovia.

At that time, a promoter visited her and offered her the opportunity to earn income without having to leave home and she took advantage of this opportunity and started her own business venture.  \r\n\r\nNow, Emma sells products from her catalogues like perfume, cream, underwear and outerwear to friends and neighbors among whom she\u2019s formed a good clientele.  She can\u2019t meet her growth goals alone because her working capital is insufficient to do so which is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan to buy more products to have stock available and increase her sales of perfume, cream, cosmetic, underwear, bathing suits and blouses.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, she\u2019d like to acquire display cases to furnish her business.  Emma\u2019s a good family member.  She has a 34-year-old son and she\u2019d also like to help with her granddaughter\u2019s university.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1229244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy perfume, cream, cosmetics, underwear, bathing suits and blouses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-11-06T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-06T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":59150},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":64341},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":65842},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":67378},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68951},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70559},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":72206},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":73891},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75615},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82067}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.8,"local_amount":59150,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":61866.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130831,"comment":null},{"amount":36.77,"local_amount":64341,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":67295.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519686,"comment":null},{"amount":37.62,"local_amount":65842,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":68865.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071530,"comment":null},{"amount":38.5,"local_amount":67378,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":70472.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497744,"comment":null},{"amount":39.4,"local_amount":68951,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":72117.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527554,"comment":null},{"amount":40.32,"local_amount":70559,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:14Z","rounded_local_amount":73799.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928314,"comment":null},{"amount":41.26,"local_amount":72206,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":75521.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705470,"comment":null},{"amount":42.23,"local_amount":73891,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":77284.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967764,"comment":null},{"amount":43.2,"local_amount":75615,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":79087.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816968,"comment":null},{"amount":46.9,"local_amount":82067,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":85835.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323252,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T17:36:48Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:52:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492068,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 45 years old and blessed with two children.

They live together in their own home, located in an agricultural region.  Ang\u00e9lica is a wonderful mother and a woman without compare, and she involves herself in various activities.  One of these is farming, to which she gives the majority of her time.  Since she was 18 years old, she has worked the land, cultivating crops like potatoes, broad beans, and field peas.  \"I prefer to grow potatoes because the variety that I grow I can sell for more than broad beans or peas,\" she says.\r\n\r\nShe has three plots of land under cultivation but at times when she wants to plant more, she rents other plots.  Each year, she seeds her fields two times with field peas or broad beans, but she only plants potatoes once.  Therefore, when the planting times come, she makes a great effort to make sure her harvest will be as she hopes.  With the support of her spouse and partner, she succeeds in planting her fields.  She is now thinking about fertilizing the fields of potatoes, and she also wants to acquire peas for planting, so she is asking for your help once again.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, thanks to your help.

They live in their own house, which he built himself in an agricultural district. Mateo is a man with perseverance. He has worked in agriculture for more than 20 years. Each season he leases land for his crops, but a year ago he acquired a plot of land of his own (one of his achievements and for which he feels pleased). There he also grows vegetables. One of the problems that he has always faced is the climatic change in the area, because of the intense cold and the rains. \"In spite of the cold, the rains are beneficial. In these months the big plantings begin, thanks to the rains,\" he mentions optimistically. With the help of his wife and two of their older children, he grows his products with happiness, because he likes his work. The satisfaction comes when he receives the money produced by his sales in the wholesale market of Tarma. His next goals are to finish this October and November planting season; for that he needs your support to acquire organic fertilizers and seeds.

from Sierra Leone! This is 26-year-old Joyce, from Torkpoi town, Bo Southern area. She is married and has no child, for now.  She has two relatives that she takes care of at home. \r\n\r\nJoyce runs a clothing business within her environment. She sells traditional pattern and design cloth. She has been running this business for 7 years. She works at the business every day, 6 days per week. Her business is the only source of income she has. Joyce says that the main challenge to her business is that sometimes customers refuses to pay her, after she provides goods on credit. \r\n\r\nJoyce has requested a loan in order to prepare more tie dye fabric for her to sell. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and start a savings account. In the future, she plans to open a clothing store. She thanks you for your

a very young age, Lorena witnessed firsthand what it means to run a small business through helping with the day-to-day activities of running her family\u2019s restaurant in Sinaloa, Mexico.  Lorena caught the entrepreneurial spirit through these early experiences and she decided she would someday follow in her parents' footsteps.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, money was tight for this single mother and she began to sell personal belongings at yard sales and swap-meets to supplement her income and support her family.  She soon realized that she had a natural ability in sales and would quickly sell out of her daily inventory.  Her friends took notice of her sales abilities and began to ask her to sell their stuff as well.  \r\n\r\nLorena\u2019s discovered love for retail led her to open her own business selling clothing and accessories at local swap meets.  Her new business is giving Lorena the opportunity she needs to better provide for her kids and create a better future for them.  \r\n\r\nThough Lorena\u2019s business is growing, she lacks the capital to purchase more quality inventory.  Lorena will use her $3,200 Kiva loan to purchase much needed inventory in time for the holiday season.  She dreams of someday growing her business to the point where she can move into a storefront boutique.

The group is located in the village of Vicente, where the Las Margaritas sugar refinery provides employment to the inhabitants of Vicente and nearby communities.\r\nEduardo is one of the members of the group. He is 42 years old and married, and he only completed high school. He tells us that he's worked at the sugar refinery since he was young, but a little over a year ago he decided to open his own business selling groceries in his house to earn a little more money and be able to give his family a higher quality of life. His wife tends the shop, and he tells us it's quite successful because the neighborhood is a new one and only has two stores. He keeps his store well stocked with a variety of products so his customers will always find what they're looking for and become loyal to his store. He will use this loan to buy beans, rice, tuna, soup, oil, cookies and crackers, soap, bleach, soft drinks, canned goods, toilet paper, toothpaste, and sweets to restock his business.

She lives with her two daughters, Hely and Emili, and cares for them in her own home.  Lourdes has spent her entire life around farming and ranching, and now it is the means by which she is able to generate income.  When she and her husband started their family 20 years ago, they decided to intensify their farming activity by growing mostly potatoes, corn, beans, wheat, barley, and fodder for their cows that roam on different plots of land.  At the moment, Lourdes continues to farm and is able to generate the necessary income to move forward.  She also owns cows and takes full advantage of them by making cheese from the milk that they produce.  Lourdes says that every morning, she is able to finish producing cheese molds within a matter of hours.  Her main customers are teachers and nurses.  Along with her family, she proposes to improve each year and exceed their previous livestock and farming production.  Her secret is to sell her products in the capital, where the level of competition gets stronger each time.  \r\n<p>\r\nLourdes is a member of the solidarity group \u201cProductoras Agr\u00edcolas Las Emprendedoras\u201d. This is her sixth loan with MFP and she is grateful for the financial support that has been provided to her in a constant manner. She now has the means to improve her business and promises to be punctual with her payments, thus demonstrating that she will be responsible.  Lourdes will invest the money she requested in the purchase of several sacks of organic compost that she can distribute among her crops.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1227450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of organic compost.
