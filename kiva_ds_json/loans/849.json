Fanny's husband is retired.  \r\n\r\nTo provide for her family, especially now that her husband isn't working, Fanny set up a grocery store in her home.

Currently, in addition to her grocery store Fanny runs a photocopy service and sells school supplies. She works everyday, often alone, or sometimes with the help of her husband or children when they are available. Her business is 11 years old and she hopes to continue improving it over time with the continued help of the loans that have brought her this far. \r\n \r\nThis particular loan will be used to stock her store.

is Zenaida, 52, resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Aureo, a driver, and is the mother to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nZenaida runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Zenaida\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a cart. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper compared to brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her cart is located in an urban poor area, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, and also used bags and footwear. If she can roll over the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nZenaida hopes to to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1086275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To pay for merchandise needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-06T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-05T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":3733,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3940.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095732,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359342,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2251.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303157,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-07T03:07:35Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":421949,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is 32 years old and lives in the town of Abaita Ababiri in the Kampala North region of Uganda.

is Melina, 55, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Federico, a vendor. She if the mother of four children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continue to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMelina operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from the round palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats, braided quilts, and bed sheets, as well as other crafts that most rug-makers make every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. \r\n\r\nMelina earns additional income from their tricycle which her husband drives regularly. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 8,000. She will be using the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, and thread for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMelina dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high-quality education through her hard work on her business.

One of the main resources in Los Bancos is water. Many streams and small springs which lead to much larger rivers have their origin in the region. The canton is home to lots of commercial activity, which takes place on the main street where hotels, restaurants, and warehouses, mostly for agricultural products, as well as veterinary services and stores which provide items used daily by the general population are located.\r\n\r\nTo cover her living costs, Maria raises chickens. She learned this business from relatives. She has a hatchery where she works for eight hours a day. When the chickens are big, it is difficult to feed them. Another activity this enterprising woman considers complicated is cleaning the ground, which is necessary to keep the hatchery clean and productive. Maria would like to invest by purchasing baby chicks and feed since she has room for more chickens than she currently has. With this investment, she hopes to increase her earnings and be able to provide her children with a better quality of life. We hope that with this loan opportunity Maria will be able to achieve the goals she has set for herself, and one day become an important business owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1078263,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

is married with three children aged between 15 and 23.

With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output. In the future, he would like to have a machine to help on his rice plantation.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \n\nFhevie operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Aside from this she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 1000 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 18,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan in her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nFhevie hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Manzanas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ten very cheerful women belong to Las Manzanas Trust Bank, which is located in the small community of Panim\u00e1, Totonicapan, Guatemala. Totonicap\u00e1n is one of the leading producers of crafts in Guatemala. Crafts are in high demand because of the quality and uniqueness of the products. \r\n\r\nLas Manzanas Trust Bank is in its sixth loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and is composed of some original members and a few new recruits. The women welcome all visitors to their community with the following words: \"Totonicap\u00e1n \u2013 land of apples, and pines, and beautiful women.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the group members, who is as enthusiastic as all of her Trust Bank members combined, is Santos. Named after holy week in Guatemala -- because that was when she was born -- Santos is 62 years old and has nine children. \r\n\r\nSantos purchases plain, raw yarn and then makes her own dyes to create a variety of colored yarn, which she then sells. She started her business 24 years ago after learning the trade from her husband\u2019s family. Santos then taught her children the technique, so now they also participate in the business. \r\n\r\nSantos is planning to use her new micro-loan to buy raw materials in bulk because the price is much better in bulk, and demand for her products is growing. In fact, one customer, who lives three and a half hours away, is requesting to have orders delivered every 15 days. Santos is thrilled with how well her business is going and now regularly employs three people. She hopes that if she continues to grow her business, she will be able to hire more employees.  \r\n\r\nSantos is very thankful to all the KIVA lenders for giving her the opportunity to improve her business, which not only helps her but also benefits her children. Las Manzanas Trust Bank is grateful to the KIVA investors for the loans. Thanks to the financial \"hand up,\" the Trust Bank members can move forward with their businesses even in tough economic times.

Josefina is 38 years old and has been married for 22 years. She has eight children (six girls and two boys), four of whom are currently in school. \r\n\r\nWith only two years of formal education, Josefina created a textile business that produces typical skirts made with a foot loom.  The business has been around for nearly a decade. She and her family spend at least six days a week working to complete their orders, and Josefina travels one and a half hours via bus once a week to deliver the orders to clients. \r\n\r\nJosefina is starting her third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. Her daughter, Maria, has also joined Josefina\u2019s Trust Bank for her first loan cycle. Maria is completing her teaching degree while building up her small business. \r\n\r\nJosefina is very excited about her new loan with Friendship Bridge because she will be able to purchase a variety of yarn and thread for her textile business. Josefina's vision is to grow her business enough so that she does not need to take out loans in the future. Josefina also wants her children to stay in school and continue their studies in college. She was not able to continue with her schooling because her family needed her to work. \u201cBefore I joined Friendship Bridge, I did think that my girls' education was important, but now I know that they need to stay in school,\u201d she says.  \u201cBy staying in school, they will be able to increase their knowledge and be more successful.\u201d \r\n\r\nJosefina, Maria and 12 other women are part of the Choqui Trust Bank. The Trust Bank members are all from the village of Chipuac, a fairly rural area outside of Totonicap\u00e1n, Guatemala. Many of the women in the Choqui Trust Bank have animal husbandry businesses, such as raising chickens, while several other members are involved in the textile industry. Each member of the Trust Bank has a different story but they all share a common vision: to be successful and to improve their lives and the lives of their families and community members. The 14 women appreciate the moral and financial support KIVA lenders provide, and they are impressed that technology can unite people from around the world with Totonicap\u00e1n\u2019s communities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6450,"image":{"id":1084870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

He is separated and has one dependent child in his care.  He lives with his son in his parents' home.  Pedro tells us that the quality of life in his community is one of subsistence.  Most of the residents are self-employed people who work in commerce, agriculture and livestock raising.  Pedro lives in the small village of Malingas, in Tambogrande district, in Piura department.  His home lacks basic services.  He tells us that approximately 80 families live in these conditions in his village.\r\n\r\nPedro's business activity is making and selling bricks.  He carries out this business on a plot of land near his home.  He also raises, fattens and sells livestock such as farmyard birds, pigs and goats.  He raises these animals in pens outside his parents' home.  He has his parents' support.  He tells us that he sells his animals either in the local market or to people who buy animals wholesale.  We should mention that Pedro has 10 years experience which has allowed him to build up a customer base for his businesses.  In addition, during the mango harvest season (the months of December, January, February and March each year) Pedro works as a security guard in a factory.\r\n\r\nPedro is currently requesting a new loan for 3,000 soles to buy fields from which he will get firewood that he needs for making his bricks.  This is a very profitable business in his area.  Over time, it will allow him to improve his family's standard of living."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1082596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy

She\u2019s been making enchiladas, fried plantain and fried manioc for more than 30 years.  The most popular item she sells are the famous \u201cpasteles de chucho\u201d as they are called.  They are made stuffed with potatoes, green beans and rice.  She sells these products in one of the city\u2019s markets from 2pm until 6pm and she also sells coffee and chocolate.  She learned this activity from family since they were in the same business.  In this way, Luscinda was able to provide her children with an education.  She buys the ingredients she needs to prepare her food like cabbage, corn, manioc, green plantain, oil and others, in the city\u2019s central market located half a kilometer from where she lives.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019s requesting is to buy 4 cabbages, 2 quintals of corn, 3 baskets of manioc, 100 green plantains, 5 gallons of oil, among others.  She will also buy 300 roofing tiles, 15 sheets of metal and 10 wood beams to replace the roof on her house that\u2019s damaged and she\u2019s afraid that with the approaching rainy season it will become even more damaged.  In this way her sales will increase and she will earn higher profits in order to attain economic solvency, pay her household expenses and help her granddaughter\u2019s with their schooling.\r\n\r\nLuscinda is thinking about adding another bedroom to her house because she has two granddaughters attending a public school and they live very far so she\u2019d like to give them a place to stay during the rainy season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1082641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

Ella desde muy joven ha sido muy activa y trabajadora. En su dinamismo aprendi\u00f3 el oficio de panader\u00eda cuando se educ\u00f3 en \u00e9l y hasta hace dos a\u00f1os fabricaba pudines y los vend\u00eda en diversas tiendas y a una clientela dom\u00e9stica entre conocidos, familiares y amigos; as\u00ed mismo aprendi\u00f3  a confeccionar ropa y confeccionaba, pero su esposo le recomend\u00f3 dejar de trabajar en estas actividades  y dedicarse a su hogar por cuestiones de salud, por eso decidi\u00f3   dejarlos, buscando una actividad en la cual no dejara de producir y pudiera ejercerla mas c\u00f3modamente y con mayor flexibilidad.

","en":"Nimia, 63, lives in the city of Barranquilla with her husband, who is retired.  They have three children, ages 32 to 39.  She has been very active and hardworking since she was very young.\r\n\r\nWith her energy she learned the trade of baking when she trained in the field.  Up until two years ago she made pudding and sold it in various stores and to home customers, among acquaintances, family members, and friends.  She also learned to make clothing, and she was making clothing, but her husband recommended that, for health reasons, she stop doing this work and dedicate herself to the home.  This is why she decided to leave those jobs, looking for a job in which she could produce and be able to to it more comfortably and with greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nThis was how she came to sell products through specialized guides or catalogues.  She tried three businesses until she chose one of them because she liked its work method and adapted it to her clientele, which she has built from among her friends and family members, who have referred her to other buyers.  This has turned into her sales strategy with her best customers.  Nimia grants one-month deadlines to pay for her products.  She works alone in her business and permanently visits her actual and potential customers to achieve business competitiveness.\r\n\r\nIn general she maintains no inventory because she sells all the products she requests and works on customer orders.  But many times they ask her for products she does not have at the moment, and this is the reason she is coming for a Kiva loan, the first financing she has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.
