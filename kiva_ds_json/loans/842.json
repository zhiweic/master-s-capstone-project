Antenor lives in the rural part of this district, but he does have electrical service at his house.\r\n\r\nAntenador raises livestock, and he farms.  When his animals reach the ideal size and weight he sells them in the local market in the area.  He has a well-established customer base, which is mostly comprised of meat dealers.  He has 0.5 hectare of farm land where he grows rice.  As a supplement, he also works as a day worker on the farms in his area.\r\n\r\nHe has requested 1,500 soles, which will be used for the maintenance and fertilization of his rice crop.  He will use the earnings from selling the rice to pay his loan obligations given that responsibility is characteristic of Antenor.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1076091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for the maintenance and fertilization of his rice crop.

Her husband is Orlando, a security guard. She together with her husband manages their household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nMarilyn operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of that sort. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be incorporating the loan in her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes her business grows more in the coming years.

They grow various fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes, onions, apples and peaches, on a family owned plot of land.  Josef sells harvested products in a local open market. Josef has a mini-tractor he uses for tilling the family owned plot of land. Also, Josef provides tilling services to neighboring farmers. Along with the agriculture work, Josef works seasonally as a worker\/painter. He fills  house-painting orders, mainly during the summer. The total average monthly income of the family is 1200 Laris.\r\n\r\nJosef requested credit for purchasing fuel for his tractor to cultivate the plot of land.

She and her husband decided that she should stay at home since he works in the coast guard and is away for two weeks each month. As a result of their decision and her financial needs, she decided to invest her capital two years ago to start a micro business, which she still runs. She invested half her money renting a house and purchasing imitation jewelry. She began to sell the jewelry in her neighborhood and in establishments in the region, recouping the money she invested and earning a profit which she used to continue purchasing more merchandise. When she looked for an opportunity to grow her business, she went to the Women\u2019s Office in Puntarenas where she was informed about the Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer [Women\u2019s Foundation]. She wants to increase her capital and be able to purchase other products so she can offer them to her customers and improve her earnings to provide for her household.\r\n\r\nShe receives 60,000 CRC [$119] in alimony for her eldest child.

According to Credo calculations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBadri requested credit for the start-up of a new type of agricultural business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Badri will purchase wooden materials, a polyethylene cover and will build the greenhouse. A small part of the credit will also be used to purchase cucumber and tomato seeds. Badri will grow cucumbers and tomatoes throughout the whole year in the greenhouse and will sell harvested products on Kutaisi market. The income of the family will significantly increase and Badri will be able to create better living conditions for his daughter and grandsons. Along with the above-mentioned, in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market, in case of need."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1079081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase materials to build a greenhouse.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kvitiri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-04-29T08:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-29T08:40:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Badri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":136},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":418807,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is thirty years old.

is Rubelyn, 33, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRubelyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRubelyn hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1080925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-29T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-29T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rubelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":866.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":3467,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3699.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606820,"comment":null},{"amount":86.66,"local_amount":3466,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3698.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095719,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2774.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359328,"comment":null},{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":3467,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3699.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303143,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-29T18:19:18Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":419579,"name":"Narantuya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Narantuya is a 51-year-old widow who lives with her parents and a son in Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia.

She earns a minimum of 100 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan.

He has a motorcycle workshop in the city of Caaguaz\u00fa. He is single and has one daughter who is a year and seven months old. \r\n\r\nRamon started working when he was a boy. He was about 8 years old when he started as an assistant in a mechanic's workshop, learning the mechanic's trade.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 23,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLorna hopes to be able to expand in the coming years, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The total average monthly income of the family is 1,000 Laris, including George's parents' pensions.  \r\n\r\nGeorge requested credit to rent a tractor to till the land and purchase fertilizers. After tilling and fertilizing he will sow maize and melons. George and Dariko will work hard on their plot during the whole spring, to get a good harvest in the summer. They hope that the weather conditions will be favorable as well. After selling the harvest George will get profits, which will be used for the family's well-being.

For the past two years, Winnifred has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Winnifred has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Winnifred to generate greater profits and pay half the school fees for her child. Winnifred hopes that in the future she will be able to spend more on the medical expenses. \r\n\r\nWinnifred is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

She currently lives in Granada.  She is 52 years old and has a primary education.  She sells groceries for a living and she is the mother of two children.  She started her business 15 years ago traveling to the market in Granada to sell the few fruit and staple grains products she got from her harvest.  With time, she bought a stall with the money her business was making from selling her fruits and grains and since then she has started to sell different products that are produced and consumed within the area.

For the past year, Madina has been working hard to manage her small mobile business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Madina has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Madina to generate greater profits and expand her business. Madina hopes that in the future she will be able to own a shop that sells clothes. \r\n\r\nMadina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Madina's future prospects by helping her to expand her business.
