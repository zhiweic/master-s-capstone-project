For many years now, Fatmata has been selling rice and groundnut\/peanuts, etc. \r\n\r\nFatmata and her group members are requesting for their second SMT\/Kiva lenders loan. Previous loans have made a huge impact on the lives and businesses of these borrowers. Having completed repaying the previous loan, they are again requesting for a new loan of 500,000 (SLL) Sierra Leonean Leones for each, in order to further develop their respective businesses. Group leader Fatmata will again use her share of the loan to buy rice and groundnuts in bulk to add to her current stock.

Her goal for later on is to export her sanitary products and her greatest challenge is not having sufficient working capital to quickly attain growth which is precisely the reason for the Kiva loan request, the first financing she\u2019s had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy supplies, like sodium bentonite in larger amounts, among others to have sufficient stock

I make most traditional Peruvian musical instruments, including percussion such as bombo and tinya drums, stringed instruments such as charango guitars, and wind instruments like the quena panpipe and zampo\u00f1a flute. I use wood and bamboo and colorful cotton threads to give each instrument a traditional Cuzco style. Thanks to hard work and my great customers, my children are able to get a higher education. Three of them want to follow their own career, while the other three want to help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you so much for your help. I'm just getting out of a difficult economic situation and this micro-credit seems like a gift from heaven! With it, I hope to be able to continue crafting instruments and increase sales.

is a Mexican artisan who works in ceramics and stoneware, and with this microcredit, he hopes to purchase materials such as clay, minerals, and glazes.\r\n\r\nChecuan has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I'm from the state of Guanajuato, and I recall being attracted to ceramics from a very young age. By the time I was 16, I started going to my godfather's workshop. I would just go there to visit and admire his work, but I had no intention of earning a livelihood from it. Eventually, my first assignment was at the potter's wheel, and during those first three years I became enamored with the work as I learned more and more with each passing day. Thinking about my future when I was 19, I decided that one day I would like to set up my own workshop. I now feel I have established myself in the world of ceramics and see it as my duty to teach others who hope to one day have their own ceramic workshop like me. Being associated with Novica means a lot to us. It makes us feel proud to know that people from every corner of the world will appreciate our work. I am thankful to the Lord, as well as to those who graced me with their teachings and confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate the opportunity for growth through this microcredit.

We work on pedal looms, a process that can take anywhere between one day and a whole month, depending on the size and design.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to thank you for making it possible for us to preserve the art of Zapotec weaving and share our designs with the world.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Mario's rugs on the NOVICA site:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.novica.com\/artistdetail\/index.cfm?faid=4567"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":1177048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To expand and improve his workshop and invite other weavers to collaborate with him","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2012-08-27T20:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-26T20:20:01Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":224.92,"local_amount":224.92,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":224.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323082721,"comment":null},{"amount":219.87,"local_amount":219.87,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-10T12:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":219.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332034622,"comment":null},{"amount":118.23,"local_amount":118.23,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-07T10:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":118.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340259533,"comment":null},{"amount":86.19,"local_amount":86.19,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":86.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347154335,"comment":null},{"amount":275.93,"local_amount":275.93,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":275.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355902182,"comment":null},{"amount":244.79,"local_amount":244.79,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":244.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364613870,"comment":null},{"amount":411.46,"local_amount":411.46,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-04T09:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":411.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373010157,"comment":null},{"amount":117.97,"local_amount":117.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-25T08:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":117.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381796042,"comment":null},{"amount":500.64,"local_amount":500.64,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":500.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390869495,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T17:17:50Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:34:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":11,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":462858,"name":"Nelson Santiago","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelson vive en Libertad donde tiene una tienda de venta de v\u00edveres, escogi\u00f3 esta actividad debido a que no consegu\u00eda empleo, empez\u00f3 con un peque\u00f1o capital que le fue dado al momento de recibir la liquidaci\u00f3n en su empleo.

All the rest of our colors are a result of combining fibers and threads from these three when weaving the fabric.

Thorn is a 33-year-old, married mother of four children. She has three daughters and one son, all of whom are dependent on her and still in school. <p>\r\n\r\nThe main source of her family's income is from rice-farming, though her husband supplements the family\u2019s income by working for others for a fee. They have been in these businesses for almost ten years. Their current businesses allow them to earn approximately 20,000 KHR per day and to save approximately 4,000 KHR per day for their future needs. Drought is the main challenge for her rice-farming business. <p>\r\n\r\nThorn has been with VisionFund for two loan cycles and proudly explains that she repaid the previous loans. The other team member has been with VisionFund for four loan cycles. The previous loans have helped her better support her family. Now she is leading her group of two to ask for a loan with VisionFund. Thorn will use her portion of the loan proceeds to buy fertilizers for her farmland and to pay fees for a water pump so that her rice plants can be harvested. She hopes this loan will enable her to grow more and better rice than before, which will in turn enable her to generate more income, improve her family's standard of living, and pay for her children's education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1177157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizers and to pay for water for her rice-farming business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ek Phnom district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-08-27T20:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-26T20:50:01Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thorn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":233300},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":233300},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":233400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":233300,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":237382.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118789,"comment":null},{"amount":58.32,"local_amount":233300,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":237382.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355941085,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":101750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046524,"comment":null},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":133400,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":135734.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837759,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T01:34:52Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":465266,"name":"06.03.07 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. H\u00e0 has a manufacturing business sewing clothes.

He earns a living by selling junior clothing and men's underwear at a local market. Vladimir rents market stalls as he does not have his own yet. He's been working in this area for 5 years.\r\n\r\nVladimir hopes to use a 5,000-UAH loan from Kiva to purchase an additional batch of junior clothing before the start of the new school year in September.

is 40 years old. He lives in the Ganta area and is married with 3 children aged 5 to 15. They all live at home and attend school. For the past 10 years he has been running a general shop. David has requested this loan to purchase more batteries, soap, rice, toothpaste, etc, in order to turn his business into a bigger one. \r\n\r\nThe problem he\u2019s faced with is his small amount of capital.

He is married and the father of a family, and has been engaged in business for the last few years. He manages his brother's business by bringing a refrigerated truck to Mali with a chauffeur to purchase fish; his brother pays him 75,000 francs CFA per month. \r\n\r\nOn each trip Mandiaye also purchases fish for his own business account, and sometimes bags of onions which he comes back to Senegal to resell. Each trip earns him an average of 50,000 francs CFA which allows him to provide for his family's needs.\r\n\r\nMandiaye is requesting a loan of 200,000 francs CFA for purchasing fish which he plans to resell in Senegal. He hopes one day to have his own vehicle and to go to Mali on his own business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1179297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase fish to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-08-28T13:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-27T13:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mandiaye","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":41948.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315889148,"comment":null},{"amount":33.02,"local_amount":16508,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-23T09:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":17312.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323610117,"comment":null},{"amount":40.64,"local_amount":20321,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T12:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":21311.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331715934,"comment":null},{"amount":46.34,"local_amount":23171,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:45:19Z","rounded_local_amount":24299.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339636168,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":20974.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356753345,"comment":null},{"amount":105.23,"local_amount":52617,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":55180.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373041443,"comment":null},{"amount":54.77,"local_amount":27383,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":28717.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381832135,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T21:21:09Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:58:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":463813,"name":"Hannah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hannah is 27 years old and lives in Buchanan.

They cultivate a collective field of millet and groundnut, and the sale of their crop brings them a fairly consistent income. They use this income to provide for their own needs as well as those of their families. The leader of the group (on the extreme left of the photo in a black boubou) is mother to four children.

More recently she was informed about the micro-loans granted by IMF H\u00e9kima. She was consequently granted a first loan of $50 to boost her business. The profits from her business are used for savings, as well as for her children's food and schooling. Meanwhile, she has just been granted her seventh loan. During this period, this customer has seen her business prosper. She has thus decided to increase her loan for this new cycle and will use it to buy two sacks of beans. In the future she would like to see her children grow up and buy a piece of land. The customer is grateful to Hekima for its actions to make poor women with low income more autonomous.

For 10 years she has worked in the area of sales stalls (kiosks) and bakeries (sopaipillas; tortillas; and cheese, shellfish, and ground beef and onion empanadas).\r\n\r\nLaura works every day from 6 in the morning until 12 midnight.

It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of the region, being the most important city in the Central Valley of Chile. There is a curious allusion to Talca in Chile, the expression \"Talca, Paris, and London.\" Among the many myths about the matter, some say that it derives from something an English person once said, \"Talca looks like London\" [Spanish \"parece\" 'looks like' and \"Par\u00eds\" 'Paris' sound alike] because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in the winter season, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1173960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy dough, flour, oil, meat, cheese, and olives","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-08-28T14:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-27T14:30:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":557114,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":63144},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66628},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":67899},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":69195},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":70516},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":71862},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":73234},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":74636}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":130.34,"local_amount":63144,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":63222.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301879092,"comment":null},{"amount":277.69,"local_amount":134527,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":134694.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147846,"comment":null},{"amount":288.4,"local_amount":139711,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":139884.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315381003,"comment":null},{"amount":299.51,"local_amount":145096,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":145276.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988154,"comment":null},{"amount":154.06,"local_amount":74636,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":74728.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331124635,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T17:40:01Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T13:14:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":464367,"name":"Keamarh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Keamarh lives in West Point.
