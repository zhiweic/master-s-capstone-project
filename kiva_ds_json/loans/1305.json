Shodi has a 7x5 meter barn in the yard of his home.  He wants to use it as a cowshed for livestock.  But the barn is very old and needs to be repaired slightly.  Shodi has savings in the amount of 600 dollars.  But this is a small sum to start this business.  He requested a loan.  Shodi will use the loan and his savings to buy four heads of bulls and make repairs in the barn for keeping livestock there.

Zoila raises chickens for a living.  She does this on her own land, where she has set up a space that can hold up to 100 chickens.  She has been in this business for about 5 years straight, during which time she has made herself known to her neighbors and the wholesale chicken buyers.  She does this work with the help of her son.  What she likes about her business is that it is profitable; it provides her with good income that allows her to cover her expenses; and it allows her to be with her children at all times.  What she does not like is that the price of chicken feed varies, which makes her profit margins vary, but this does not discourage her from continuing to work.

Narayani Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maa Narayani is a Joint Liability Group of six poor women of a rural village, Chanabeda, of Nuapada district in Odisha, India. This group was formed to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the expansion of existing businesses. \r\n\r\nJayanti, a simple and confident lady, is one of the members of this group. She hails from a poor family living below the poverty line. The lady standing third from the left in the photo and raising her hand is Jayanti. She is 34 years old and lives with her husband, one son of thirteen years, and two daughters of eleven and four years of age, in a small mud house. Her elder daughter and son are continuing their studies in the village school. \r\n\r\nJayanti has been running a tiffin stall with selling of eggs for the last five years in her village, with the hand-holding support of her husband. Jayanti prepares breakfast items like samosa, wada, potato chup (local names for different types of snacks), etc. Her stall is very popular due to good-quality items. She starts her tiffin stall at 8:00 a.m. in the morning and closes at 6:00 pm in the evening. \r\n\r\nDue to the rural base, she earns a little monthly income of 4,000 INR from the above business. With this small income, she is hardly able to manage her household and the educational expenses of her children. She had wanted to expand the business, but finance was a constraint for her. \r\n\r\nWhen she learned about Mahashakti Foundation, she joined in the group and has taken a loan of 10,000 INR for expansion of her business. With the present loan, Jayanti wants to purchase more stock of oil, dough, sugar, etc. to increase the quantity of items. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she has to replenish her stock frequently from the nearest market of five kilometers away. \r\n\r\nJayanti hopes to save enough to construct a permanent cabin for her tiffin stall and construct a house for her family. \r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Banita, Sabhya, Bhagyabati, Indira and Phulmani, who are running a fruits stall, tea and tiffin stall, general store, dry food vending business, and tea stall respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is self-employed, engaged in the manufacture of stone products. Not so long ago, Jolt's family bought a small home.<br \/><br \/>Jolt needed a sum of 24,000 hryvnia in order to improve their living conditions. In raising three small children, Jolt understood the a family needs a new warm and cozy home, where his children would be able to grow happy and healthy. Therefore they did everything possible in order to buy a small one-story little home, where they also recently moved. Since money was quite sparse, they bought a home in disrepair with the hope that they will then do repairs gradually. Jolt dreams of renovating the existing premises and later building three additional rooms, so that his family, in the end, will be able to live in normal conditions. For this, he works a lot, facing challenges not to lose heart. <br \/><br \/>In the photo, Jolt stands beside his wife"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1492610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to remodel a newly purchased house that is in a very poor condition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Beregovo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.216667 22.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-12-19T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jolt","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":653.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":650.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":747.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":771.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":703.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":818.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":844.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":788.71},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":896.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":905.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":900.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":982.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":981.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1015.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1090.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1086.79},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1112.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1181.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1210.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1235.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1290.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1373.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1426.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.69},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.12},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.71},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.73},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T12:59:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647088,"name":"Svetlana","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435 38 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 -

financial help of Kiva. Due to the increase in production and the consistently high quality of production of his goods, Viktor has loyal customers. In particular, one private hotel became a regular customer, making him regular orders. Viktor in turn could then begin to make more complicated furniture, and of a better quality. Due to the regular income, Viktor was able to buy a home and make repairs there.

He is pictured here in a group of eight One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 87 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Amos has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving one-quarter acre of maize and one-quarter acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nAmos is married and has three children. He is 25 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Amos has been a farmer for eight years. Amos described his harvest as good last year, but he believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nAmos first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Amos joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer, and hybrid seeds. He also wants to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, is an active community member, wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.\r\n\r\nAmos and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

The individual farmers are not pictured here, but they will be receiving an average loan of KES 5,349 (shillings).\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPeter is 64 years old and has been a farmer for 34 years. Peter works as a farmer to provide for his 13 children. The community and other farmers know Peter as friendly, hard-working, and trustworthy. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community, such as the prayer group and burial committee. Peter described his harvest last year as being good, but he hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPeter joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season, as a group leader. Peter joined One Acre Fund, so that he could get new farming methods, fertilizer, and hybrid seeds. Because he likes being a leader, Peter has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund, as a group leader and as a Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Peter's life because he was able to save money and he was able to feed the family. In the future, Peter hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nPeter and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are two additional group leaders in this photo that will be working with One Acre Fund, but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-19T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":5575,"lender_count":189,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hezron ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wataka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zebedayo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kiveu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mboya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makari","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":481410,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481410}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T19:20:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647395,"name":"Goderdzi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Goderdzi, age 47, is from the village of Dzirula.

The community and other farmers know Daniel as friendly and trustworthy. He is also involved in his community with the men's group, prayer group and burial committee.  Daniel described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nDaniel joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.

He also wants to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  \r\n\r\nBecause he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Daniel has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Daniel's life because he has been able to save money and feed his family.  In the future, Daniel hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and buy a cow.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Daniel and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

The work schedule varies according to demand, but the work day is normally about 6 hours. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is seeking is for the purchase of fabric to make clothing designs that are in demand in the community. She is well-known, since she is the only person who has learned how to do this work, and people seek her out.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help her to earn more income, since she will be able to fulfill her demand; and this will translate into well-being for her daughter, as she will be able to provide for her basic needs.\r\n\r\nMartha\u2019s dream for her business is to open her own shop in the city, and she says that she would like to become a businesswoman. She hopes that her business will grow until she has her own dressmaking school where she will teach anyone who wants to learn this profession.\r\n\r\nHer desire for her family is that her daughter will be able to study what she, for lack of economic resources, could not; and she works hard so that will be able to give her daughter an education.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help her to have the materials that she needs in order to sell her garments.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase fabric in order to make the clothing styles that people in her community are requesting.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":37.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":37.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":42.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":43.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":52.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T22:28:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647406,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys, a 53-year-old married mother of one from Thika, has a business of mixed crop farming.

She works as a seamstress in a textile factory. She is married and has two adult children. Since both children had to go to school, all of the family's money was used to pay those expenses. Their house has needed repairs for a long time. The family needs 11,000 hryvnia to replace the roof of the house. Now the family doesn't have to pay for the children's education because they are grown up and have their own families, but they still do not have enough money to repair the house. Anjelika's husband used to work a lot, but then he got sick and only receives a pension now. Therefore, the family really hopes for additional financial assistance through Kiva, because it is critical for them.

She has been running a cloth weaving & selling business with her husband. Presently, she has two hand looms for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader 20 km away from her village. They knit 80 to 100 pieces from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. She only produces saris because of the demand in the market. Damayanti makes two pieces of sari per day. Apart from this, she also purchases ready made garments from the local market. Her husband goes to weekly markets to sell the clothes. From this business, she earns a monthly income of Rs 7,000, which is not sufficient to make her future dream materialize. With the present loan of 48,000 INR, she wants to buy bulk quantities of thread\/yarn and ready-made garments to increase her income. Purchasing in bulk will help her to reduce the purchasing & transportation costs of the raw materials. Damayanti wishes to grow her business and save enough to construct a good house.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Pramila, Basanti, and Hema who are doing a cloth business  and Padmabati, who is running a general store.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase thread\/yarn and ready made garments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TUKLA,KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":3900,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Padmabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":240000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":240000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T05:45:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647429,"name":"Karen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Karen is 34 years old and lives in the village Getahovit in Tavush region.

At one point he even worked out of M\u00e9xico City for some time. Mar\u00eda, she likes to take care of their children and 10-15 chickens they usually have, she cooks and gives the family food. They sow maize in the maize season and they collect coffee as well.\n\nMaria and Alonzo would love to leave the land for their children in the future but they know it\u00b4s difficult nowadays because there\u00b4s not much land to split among all of them. That\u00b4s why they want to at least leave them with a better and safe house where they can help each other to live happy and healthy. \n\nThey would like to have a kitchen and bathroom inside the house, they would keep it clean and without smoke. There\u00b4s a governmental organization that helps with money sometimes in exchange of going to reunions and workshops, the difficulty for them is that they don\u00b4t have where to leave their kids and they are not allowed to take them with them.They think Habitat can support them and they really wish to be beneficiaries.\n\nHabitat for Humanity is a nonprofit international organization founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe and affordable place to live. Habitat for Humanity Mexico works in communities with groups who build through mutual help and a self-construction system where the families need to participate in workshops and trainings about building, healthy housing and financial education, this aiming to develop and strength their capacities. In M\u00e9xico, works since 1989 and today more than 7,000 families have been served just on the last 3 years."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1477378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy

Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nHenry is married and has eight children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for 30 years now. They are currently growing beans, millet, and maize and raising livestock on their farm. Henry is excited about beekeeping as the honey produced will be a source of food and medicine for his family and it will also earn him extra income.\r\n\r\nThis is Henry\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. He is interested in working with Honey Care because they are keen in keeping their promises. He intends to use the income generated from his beekeeping to pay school fees for some orphans he is taking care of and to provide for their basic needs.

Originally the business intended to exclusively distribute shears and scissors made in their Pakistani factory. However, the company has expanded beyond their own factory to include products made in other factories. In 2010, the business generated $100,000 in sales. This year, Mohammad opened a store front. Having a store front has allowed Mohammad to offer a greater selection to his clients as well as be able to sharpen blades on-site, which is a service he would like to provide in the future.

She says this is the first time she\u2019s joined Pro Mujer after receiving an invitation from her mother who is a member of that institution. She currently has an onion-selling business and she has mentioned that she learned the business from her parents, since she worked on the family farm as a girl. After marrying, she decided to set up an independent workspace. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she\u2019s taking out now is to raise her capital (to buy onion seeds), which she\u2019ll buy from wholesale vendors from Ciudad de El Alto. After the crop grows, she\u2019ll sell it using her retail space. This kind of work helps her to generate an income to support her family, since she\u2019s married with 3 children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the training area and the meetings.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":652.79,"image":{"id":1470261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.

The community and other farmers know Priscillah as friendly and hard-working.  Other than farming, she is also involved in community activity, such as the women's group.  Priscillah described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nPriscillah joined One Acre Fund in 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Priscillah joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  Because she is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, Priscillah has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Priscillah's life because she has more farm training, and has more farm group support.  She was also able to save money and feed her family.  In the future, Priscillah hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to save for the future, and to buy a cow.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Priscillah and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-19T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":4150,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscillah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mildred","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zakaria","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":358383,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358383}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-20T09:03:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647507,"name":"Fanny Maritza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fanny de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta  primer grado de nivel acad\u00e9mico, es madre soltera de dos hijos.

He studied through the seventh grade. He lives with his wife who is responsible for maintaining their home. He is the father of a 3-year-old daughter who lives with them. In Juan's house also lives his mother-in-law and sister-in-law but only his daughter and wife are dependent on him. \r\n\r\nJuan works as a mototaxi driver, which he has been doing for three years. He learned the profession because he saw the need for transportation in his town, since many people traveled on foot across the town to their neighbors' districts. Therefore he decided to buy a mototaxi. Additionally, he owns a bakery with his mother and sister. This business is 30 minutes from his house and he travels to work in his mototaxi. He works in the bakery with his mother and sister, but works the mototaxi job alone. He works from 4 o'clock in the morning until 7 o'clock at night.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to buy more supplies for the bakery and two bicycles with baskets from which he can sell bread. That way he can employ additional people and generate more earnings for him and his family. This will improve his business because more people will learn about the delicious bread that he makes since he will travel to sell it in the nearby districts. This will satisfy his need for more profits.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to have a larger bakery and a mototaxi transportation business. He will achieve this with hard work and the help of God, through which he will increase his earnings and profits. With that he will give his family a better quality of life and an education to his daughter.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies and equipment for his bakery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Ram\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":43.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":44.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":51.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":55.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T21:11:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647331,"name":"Makhburat","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0430\u0445\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442 42 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c-\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043a\u0430, \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438-\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438. \u0423 \u041c\u0430\u0445\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442 -

In this way, she generates enough money to pay for personal and household expenses.\r\n\r\nWith the intention of continuing her work, she is requesting the loan to purchase wholesale fabric, thread, buttons, and other basic materials.  This will allow her to work more comfortably and enable her to fulfill her customers\u2019 orders and requests, leading to an increase in sales and, therefore, income she receives for her work. \r\n\r\nOrlanda says that her age won\u2019t stop her from continuing to dream, and for this reason, she continues striving to fulfill her desire to have a much larger workshop that is well structured, with industrial sewing machines.  This will allow her to generate jobs, improve profitability, and have the ability to improve her living conditions and enjoy old age without worrying about money.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase wholesale fabric, thread, buttons, and other basic materials.

","en":"Monica is 46 years old and the mother of a four-year-old child. She lives with her son in the south of the city. She has had a sewing workshop in her home for 13 years, where she sews women's, men's and children's clothing. She was very young, 14 years old, when she began to work at a workshop, completing a variety of different tasks. This is where she learned this activity, guided by the owner of the business, who saw that Monica was inspired and had a lot of potential as a seamstress. Little by little, Monica learned from her. After that, Monica trained for three years at an academy to develop better skills. She learned sewing techniques until she had to begin to work from home in order to care for her ill father. <br \/><br \/>Given this situation, she became independent and began her own entrepreneurial adventure. Today she makes blouses, pants, and bermuda shorts, all from her own home. That's where her customers come to buy things and use her sewing services.<br \/><br \/>Every day it takes more and more in order to compete in the sewing business, and although Monica has mastered the diverse techniques involved sewing, she hasn't managed to break into the wholesale market because of a lack of infrastructure. Being a wholesale provider is currently the most profitable way of making a living in this field. This is the reason why Monica is currently requesting a Kiva loan. This will be her first funding from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to purchase a sewing machine, an industrial serger, and a cover-stitch machine.

He also wishes to become a great police officer once he finishes his professional studies in his current educational institution.\r\n\r\nBecause he doesn\u2019t have the financial capacity to obtain such goals, he relies on Kiva\u2019s support to fulfill the first of his goals, which is to finish his current studies. Another objective that he has besides studying with great determination is to get a job during his free time so he can support his commitment towards formation, increase his personal growth and support his family, especially his parents. \r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1513407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay his tuition fee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-19T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-18T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janner Stiven ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T03:30:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647545,"name":"Mausauri","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mausauri  continua con la venta de \u00fatiles de escritorio por lo tanto en esta oportunidad requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar mercader\u00eda como por ejemplo cuadernos, lapiceros, papeles y otras cosas m\u00e1s, \u00e9l agradece a quienes forman parte de este sue\u00f1o mediante este medio pues valora el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas mensuales con mucha responsabilidad. \u00c9l pertenece al banco Comunal \u201cSan Martincito\u201d de la Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa de la ciudad de Paucartambo.","en":"Mausauri continues to sell stationary items and he needs a loan to buy merchandise such as notebooks, mechanical pencils, paper, and other things.

the beneficiary is 34 years old and her husband Lorenzo is 40 years old. They have 3 children: Gaspar, the oldest is 14 years old, 2 years younger is Mar\u00eda and the youngest one is Lorenzo Jr. of 10 years old, they live in a small community in southern Mexico that has 1262 inhabitants. \n\nThey now live in a 2 rooms wood house, without doors, windows or bathroom. The family hopes to get a loan beneficiary to build their home since their children have grown and they need more space. They also wish to have a clean bathroom.\nDominga\u2019s family does not have much land to work. Sometimes they rent the land but the costs are very expensive and the harvest barely pays the rent. They say they have lots of problems with field rats that eat the maize they have sown and this is the only food they have for sure for them and their children. \n\nDominga likes to sew and she has a sewing machine with it she provides incomes to the family. Lorenzo is farmer, he also cleans maize fields, sows coffee, and does whatever he can to get money depending the season. The older children sometimes can\u00b4t go to school because they need to work on the field or carrying firewood and water, the little ones also go to school when Dominga and Lorenzo don\u00b4t need them in their house; they love to take care of the hens and chickens. They wish in the future their children to go to school in the municipality school so they can have better jobs and don\u00b4t suffer what their parents did.\n\nThey believe in Habitat as they have seen other families in their community benefit. Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit international organization founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe and affordable place to live. Habitat for Humanity Mexico works in communities with groups who build through mutual help and a self-construction system where the families need to participate in workshops and trainings about building, healthy housing and financial education, this aiming to develop and strength their capacities. In M\u00e9xico, works since 1989 and today more than 7,000 families have been served just on the last 3

He is in a common-law relationship and his wife performs the household chores.  For three years, Jos\u00e9 has worked as a salesman of hammocks, toys, sound equipment on order, and various home appliances.  He learned this business from a brother-in-law that used to sell these products. He looked at the possibility of carrying on the business and he knew that it was generating income, so he decided to pursue the idea and put it into practice.  The job is two hours away and he goes out selling in the neighboring cantons.  He made his first investment with the help of the loans and sees that it is better to be able to buy more and it helps to better invest his money in the business.  He goes out on his own to sell, and his wife stays home and if someone is looking for a small thing, she sells it there.  Jos\u00e9 leaves home at 7:00 in the morning and gets home at 4:00 in the afternoon. When business goes well, he sells everything and then comes home.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting the loan to purchase seven hammocks that were ordered, a toy, and a bed that the neighbors had ordered.  This is how he will invest the money, and thus earn profits.  He also leaves home appliances on credit and then, on a designated day, he stops by homes collecting the money.  The profits will be invested in more things that he needs, and this will greatly improve his life.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1513418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase seven hammocks that were ordered, a toy, and a bed that the neighbors had ordered","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-19T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-18T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Elenilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":30.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":33.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":32.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":34.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":36.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":38.12},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":38.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":39.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":43.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":44.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":49.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.71},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.14},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647677,"name":"Rita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rita has owned and operated a general store for more than six years, earning well enough to be able to provide for her family's needs.

Thanks to Oroskul's hard work, today her business contains 4 dairy cows and also a small land plot, wher she plants perennial herbs and sunflower (seeds).

They prepare hay and feed for the winter by themselves.  The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Oroskul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows for fattening up and subsequent resale at a market at a high price.

This will enable him to start his production to meet the seasonal demand in December, when traditionally people eat more of this type of meat. This will allow him to generate extra income for his family. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has a lot of drive, positive attitude and perseverance and wants to make good progress with his pig production project.
