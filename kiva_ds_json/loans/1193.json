She has been engaged in cattle breeding for the past 13 years. During these years, she gained the necessary skills and knowledge for the effective management of her business. \r\n\r\nShe usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them for five to six months, and then resells them for a profitable price in the livestock bazaar. She also makes homemade yogurt and sells it, along with fresh milk, to her neighbors. Her monthly income is about 144 AZN. This business is the family's only source of income.

I\u2019m 17-years-old and I live in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, the place where I was born and where I happily grew up alongside my father who is a cabinetmaker, my mother who is employed and a younger brother.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve decided that I want to attend APEC University in Santo Domingo which is renowned for the great quality of the career I\u2019ve chosen: Publicity.

It\u2019s something that inspires me and that I know I can do with effort giving my best to others and to society.  I plan to start my courses, God willing, in August of this very year.\r\n\r\nAt home it\u2019s barely enough to support the family which is why we need help because we don\u2019t have the resources needed to pay for my studies and this is why we are requesting this loan.  Getting it would mean the opportunity to study and grow as a person and reach one of my goals of becoming a professional to thus also help people in need like I am at the moment.\r\n\r\nMy goals are

Her only economic activity is growing coffee and they\u2019ve been acquiring their land through inheritance from her parents and her parents-in-laws.  The challenges found in this activity are drops in prices and the heavy rain (climactic factor) since competition is not a problem in this line of work.  Her field is 50 meters away from her house and both she and her husband are involved in working it.\r\n\r\nHer future plans and dreams as a mother is that her crops become more productive and to buy more parcels of land so that her children will be able to attend school and also have an estate in which to work.  Her dream is to see her children attain a better standard of living in future and to use some of the profits from her crops to make some home improvements and the other part to buy new coffee plants.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Maricela has requested a loan from Comixmul Cooperative to buy 8 sacks of 18-46-0 fertilizer, 10 sacks of urea, 8 sacks of coffee growing formula and nitrate among others to protect her crop and to provide better care.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1413957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies for her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-20T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-19T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T14:50:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":595371,"name":"Baylar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Baylar is an IDP (internally displaced person) from Fizuli city.

Olga.  She says that this is the first time she has joined Pro Mujer after receiving an invitation from a promoter of the organization who visited her at her house.  Olga currently has a dairy business, but she also sells livestock.  She gained knowledge of this trade by working in her family\u2019s business for several years.  After she got married, she started an independent business where she works with her own family.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying dairy cows that she will acquire at the neighboring fairs.  Afterwards she will raise the animals before selling them from her business.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income for maintaining her household.  Olga is married and has two children.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Olga said that she enjoys the training seminars about health and credit.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":630.02,"image":{"id":1413989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy dairy cows.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

want to encourage women to feel beautiful from what they're wearing\u2026 It's truly a great source of pride. There is power in fashion,\" says Heather, owner and founder of Heather Who.\r\n\r\nHeather is a young woman trying to create a more fulfilling life for herself by doing what she loves. As a little girl growing up, Heather remembers sitting on the couch with her mother every night watching movies starring lead female roles like Hepburn and Monroe. Inspired by these women, Heather set out to discover what made these women so strong.\r\n\r\nShortly after graduating college, Heather realized that she would never be satisfied working for other people so instead she followed her entrepreneurial spirit and decided to do what she loves in order to make a living. Starting off by just word of mouth, Heather was able to create some buzz and pull in clientele for her brand new custom clothing businesses. Rather than opening a retail store, Heather knew that she wanted to make customized clothes so that her customers could see their outfits from start to finish. \"It's a great experience when you know who made the clothes, and then there's truly a story with it,\" says Heather.\r\n\r\nBy starting this business Heather hopes to empower women through fashion in her community and with this loan of $10,000, Heather will be allowed to produce a small ready-to-wear collection for her online store as well as doing marketing.

They live together in their own house with their 3 children. Juan works in agriculture, specifically in farming regional products, like plantain, rice, yuca and others. His main plantation comprises diverse varieties of plantain, those that are in high demand in his region. His products are sold to wholesale merchants in the city markets. He's been running his business for 20 years and remembers how much work and effort it took to establish it. He used to sow papaya, but a plague arrived and destroyed his investment. However, he soldiered on and began sowing a different crop. He works with the help of his wife and on some occasions he contracts the services of other workers. Fortunately, it's going well for him; his crops are harvested frequently because he established different sowing times and now he has variation in his production stage. On this occasion he is requesting 2,000 soles. He's very happy to know that he'll have financial support and as such feels secure that he can move his business forward.

is Romeo, 29, resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. He is married to Carol, a housewife, and they have two children. Together they manage their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRomeo operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials, like metal, copper, plastic, and paper. They sell these to junk shops like Romeo's, for a little profit. Junk shops then sort, clean, stack, and gather huge quantities of these materials, and sell them back to factories and other buyers. Romeo regularly buys recyclables from his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales, every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. He will be incorporating the loan into his revolving fund, which he uses to buy trash from collectors.\r\n\r\nRomeo dreams to expand his business and have another junk shop. He hopes to have good health. He meets up with his co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of his work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She plans to use her loan to buy four sets of the \u201cbazin\u201d type fabric in Bamako. She sells for cash or on credit, at the market and as a street vendor, to a customer base composed mainly of women. With this loan, Fati hopes to earn an average monthly revenue of 45,000 West African francs, which will be used to reinvest in her business and cover the healthcare costs for her children. Her goal is to buy a land plot and build a house for her children. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":687.5,"image":{"id":1410769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy traditional fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"District de Bamako","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-08-21T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-20T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fati          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gogo        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madj\u00e8       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":67822.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924445,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":67822.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207636,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":67822.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972316,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":67822.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624875,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":67822.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850872,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T21:46:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":595654,"name":"Kerta Jaya Amerta Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"With only eight members, the Kerta Jaya Amerta group continues its lending.

She is applying for a PHP 8,000 loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. Felisa hopes to have a grocery store some day, and she dreams that her children will finish their studies.

Carlos has been doing this work for two years and, in this short time, has dealt with all types of situations.  Carlos is grateful for his work as he has the advantage of being able to go wherever he wants and he can decide his own timetable.  Carlos would like to continue working and to buy another vehicle in order to give somebody else who needs to improve their financial situation the opportunity to work.  On this occasion Carlos is applying for 1500 Nuevo Soles and is grateful to those financing the loan and giving him the necessary support to work toward his goals. Carlos will use this loan to buy three tyres as the current ones have become damaged by the bad state of the roads and have become deteriorated over time.  He will also upholster the vehicle and pay his mechanic.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":352.22,"image":{"id":1414682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy three tyres, upholstery for his vehicle and to pay the mechanic.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-21T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-20T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":228.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":247.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":256.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":266.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":272.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.86,"local_amount":228.71,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":234.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865250,"comment":null},{"amount":83.3,"local_amount":227.18,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":233.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353618,"comment":null},{"amount":90.84,"local_amount":247.74,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":254.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905379,"comment":null},{"amount":94.22,"local_amount":256.98,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":263.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091369,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-30T05:39:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596444,"name":"H\u00e9fum\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Veuve de 48ans, madame H\u00e9fum\u00e9 est m\u00e8re de 02 enfants \u00e2g\u00e9s de 15 et 12ans qui sont scolaris\u00e9s.

She lives with her husband in a nuclear family in the Darsalam district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having gone to school, Ms. Fanta started running revenue-generating businesses early on, along with her mother, who used to sell condiments and kitchen utensils. After several years of apprenticeship at her mother's side, she worked by herself doing commerce in clothing. She has been working by herself in this business for 21 years and enjoys a great reputation and fame. Her selling power is due to the quality of her clothing, which are first picks. \r\n\r\nWith plans to increase her business capital in order to cope with the customer demand, especially during the school-year vacation, when parents make purchases for their children to prepare for the return to school, [Ms. Fanta is requesting a loan from the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso]. She has had ties to it for sixty months after having had three solidarity loans and six individual loans, all paid back. She is now on her seventh individual loan, which she will use to purchase 5 bales of secondhand clothing. She gets her supplies from Bamako and sometimes locally.\r\n\r\nShe accepts cash or credit from a mixed customer base. She envisions making a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA enabling her to bolster her working capital and to pay for her transportation costs, as well as to cope with the Soro Yiriwaso loan payments.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":170.45,"image":{"id":1411883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase secondhand clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-08-21T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-20T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.81},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":27921.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972320,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":27921.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624879,"comment":null},{"amount":56.81,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":27921.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850876,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T18:51:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":596473,"name":"Kossi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr Kossi vit avec sa conjointe(couturi\u00e8re) et leurs 04 enfants tous \u00e0 LOME.

Sang, a second time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) is leading six other borrowers who are first time borrowers to get a new loan.

Her dream was to be a doctor who was good at her work. She wanted to specialize in pediatrics since she has always liked children. With the passage of time, Cristina wanted to be many things: psychologist, professor, lawyer, and even a flight attendant. But despite all these career choices, she never forgot her dream of being a doctor.\r\n\r\nIn the final year of her baccalaureate, Cristina couldn't decide what to do since shortly, she would leave that epoch of friends, diversions, and daring which she enjoyed so much to enter the real world where one has to struggle to achieve better things. After graduating, Cristina began to think about what she should study but in this period, she had forgotten her dream, because many people told her that for this career she needed more than simply the will.\r\n\r\nWith these simple words, Cristina abandoned her dream and began looking for other careers to study. One day she spoke with her brother and he asked her what had become of her dream, since he recalled that from an early age, Cristina had played at being a doctor with her dolls. She responded that due to life's conditions, that is money, she couldn't study medicine, although she would have given everything to do so.\r\n\r\nCristina's brother said that Cristina shouldn't abandon her dream entirely, that she should study to be a nursing assistant. She accepted the idea and began to study to be a nursing assistant. After a semester she was excited to begin working in a hospital as an assistant, enabling her to pay to enroll in the superior nursing program and upon finishing this, she could better afford her career in medicine and specialize in pediatrics.\r\n\r\nWhat Cristina likes most about nursing is learning to administer medicines, channel her assistance, take blood, cure wounds, and other things she has learned that an assistant must do. None of these tasks cause her revulsion because she knows that by doing all this, she will become a grand doctor.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Cristina, an adolescent who from her childhood, wished to be a doctor and who little by little and with effort and dedication, is achieving the dream of becoming the best pediatric doctor, and of advancing her family and making them proud of her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1414699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"to study towards her pediatric medical degree.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-21T16:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-20T16:20:06Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina  Yineth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":770000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":210000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":154.55,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":296660.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780602,"comment":null},{"amount":40.29,"local_amount":73000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":77343.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539977,"comment":null},{"amount":75.61,"local_amount":137000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-14T10:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":145151.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752505,"comment":null},{"amount":78.93,"local_amount":143000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-29T09:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":151508.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845811,"comment":null},{"amount":75.62,"local_amount":137000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":145151.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439696779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T17:25:32Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598052,"name":"Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Teresa tiene 59 A\u00f1os de edad es agricultora y madre de familia la cual est\u00e1 compuesta por 11 hijos con un grado de educaci\u00f3n cursado hasta el sexto grado ya que sus padres no ten\u00edan la capacidad para darle la oportunidad para que estudiara hasta la universidad y era muy dif\u00edcil el hecho de estudiar ya que no hab\u00edan los suficientes centros de educaci\u00f3n para poder asistir.

The five women are all teachers at a rural school, and they have been using a big portion of their salary to buy fuel. They use charcoal and LPG gas for cooking and also buy kerosene and candles for lighting, as their homes are not connected to the electricity grid.\n\nJane, the eldest among them, sitted at the middle in the photo, has lived in this village for the last 11 years and has suffered the effects of  using kerosene.  Three years ago one of her children accidentally hit a kerosene lantern, sending their house into flames and leaving them homeless. She was not aware that there was an alternative to kerosene, however, so she continued using it. Only recently did she meet the VEP sales team at a community training and learned about solar lamps, which caught her interest. She also  confesses that the poor lighting levels from kerosene lamps has for years made it difficult for her children and those of her neighbors to study, affecting their performance in school. With solar lighting she hopes this will change and they will get better grades.\n\nThese women are taking a loan to purchase a solar home package that will enable each of them to light up to four rooms, charge mobile phones, and use a small radio.  Together with her group mates they will spread the benefits of using solar and transform their dark village into a bright one.
