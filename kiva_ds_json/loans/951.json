","en":"Carmen is 35 years old.  She is separated from her spouse and lives with her high-school aged son in the city of Santo Domingo of the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province.  Santo Domingo is connected to the Sierra and Costa del Ecuador regions.  The city has become a commercial hub with its many growing sectors evident in the various entrepreneurial families that started small businesses just a few years back and are now creating employment opportunities.  Studies reveal that most businesses started organically and have been supported by the passing of tourists, business people, and travelers who move from one region to the other.  It is also the third most populous city in the country.\r\n\r\nCarmen has been making a living selling cosmetics for the last five years.  Her business model is to visit her customers at their respective homes or workplace.  The sacrifice of educating her son without the presence of his father has been very hard for her but she has demonstrated courage and strength as she plans to succeed.  Despite having only attending grade school she wishes to use her income to complete and improve the structure of her home which was left unfinished.  This way she will be able to improve her and her son's quality of life.

This will be his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, but he's sure that he can rely on them to strengthen and grow his business because they always give him timely and reliable financial counsel.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1196089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy oranges and cheese to increase his income so he can finish his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-09-22T15:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-22T15:30:01Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvino Bartolome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1584.6,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":121.51},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":128.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":130.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":134.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":138.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":140.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":142.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":247.88,"local_amount":245.49,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":247.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382673,"comment":null},{"amount":126.32,"local_amount":125.11,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":126.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989755,"comment":null},{"amount":128.75,"local_amount":127.51,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":128.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126163,"comment":null},{"amount":262.01,"local_amount":259.49,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":262.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068621,"comment":null},{"amount":135.08,"local_amount":133.78,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":135.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494896,"comment":null},{"amount":135.87,"local_amount":134.56,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":135.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524822,"comment":null},{"amount":138.13,"local_amount":136.8,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":138.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133134,"comment":null},{"amount":142.63,"local_amount":141.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":142.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313681,"comment":null},{"amount":141.24,"local_amount":139.88,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":141.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565288,"comment":null},{"amount":142.09,"local_amount":140.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":142.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814343,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-22T11:45:43Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:22:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":473541,"name":"Eyad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eyad is a 36-year-old man.

Two years ago she decided to start and invest in her own business, where she works 8 hours a day, including Saturdays, and where she receives help from her two adult children. She is applying for a loan from  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, which she will use to purchase materials and supplies in order to make more clothing, This hard working woman wants to take advantage of the talent she has and be able to improve her earnings and be able to give her children the benefits and education that she dreams of.

The area is also known for raising livestock and agriculture that is sustained by the mild climate, cold and warm humidity.  The poverty index is more than 50%, but the majority of the inhabitants have basic services (water, electricity, etc) in their homes.\r\n\r\nMario learned from his parents how to raise livestock for later sale and also to sell the milk that they produce.  Two years ago, he decided to involve himself more deeply in the business and learn this work, which he does for eight hours a day without help from anyone.  Although many merchants oppose paying a fair price, Mario is asking for a loan to purchase more animals and items to care for them so that he can offer these animals a price that allows him to generate a higher profit.  He will create a savings account so that one day he can achieve his dream of building his own house.

is a 35-year-old young woman. She is married and a mother of three sons and two daughters. Her husband is a worker who earns a modest salary which is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\nFor the past four years, Nisreen has been doing embroideries and selling them to customers upon their request. It has been a profitable venture but it also needs support from time to time to cover the cost.\r\nNisreen is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her cover the costs of purchasing new fabrics and threads. Taking this loan will increase demand and requests from her customers to buy embroideries. This will increase her income and provide her family with better living conditions. Nisreen is photographed while she is doing embroidery.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nSa'eda, 34, is the married mother of two sons and two daughters. She is a UN employee and her husband is also employed but both are earning low salaries that are not enough to cover the family's needs and costs.\r\n\r\nSa'eda is therefore requesting a loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing new bedroom furniture for her children in order to improve their living conditions in the house. Taking this loan will offer to her children comfortable furniture so they can enjoy living in the house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Aida is from Otavalo, but she lives in the El Pacto parish, located in the canton of San Miguel de Lo Bancos.  This is a town that is visited by many people because of its waterfalls and the biodiversity of species that one can observe passing through the countryside.  This place has an exceptional gastronomy; it's known for its traditional dishes that are sold by many of its residents.  In addition to this, the local hotels, agricultural supply stores and offerings of extreme sports activities, support the economic growth of the city.  In the rural neighborhoods there are households who are devoted to farming and livestock activities, so this area also specializes in the processing of milk and its derivatives, such as cheese, sweet milk, and other dairy products.\r\n\r\nAida inherited her parents' talent for making \"panela,\" a food that is made from a base of sugarcane which is full of vitamins and nutrients that are good for the human body.  She uses this to make drinks, and it also serves as a natural sweetener and energizer.   It has curative properties, from healing wounds to treating ulcers.  Aida has been making this product for 6 years, and she invests up to 10 hours a day in this business while also attending to her home.  She needs to increase her income to support her husband in paying for the education of their children.

The city is known for its warm and welcoming climate.  It is also the birthplace of great glories of Peruvian sports.  Additionally, the inhabitants are very happy people who have a gift for preparing the typical dishes of the area which are very delicious.  Chincha also has beautiful beaches and also develops agriculture and livestock.  When he has free time he likes to walk with his family and enjoy one of his favorite dishes, the rich ceviche.  Due to a lack of finances, he was only able to study until the fifth grade of secondary school, but he would have liked to attend university.  \r\n\r\nDay by day, Freddy works at a textile factory as a laborer.  He works about ten hours a day and with the fruit of his labor, he is able to meet his household expenses.  He thinks his work is going well because he is responsible and wants to get ahead.  \r\n\r\nFreddy is very thankful to the Kiva loaners since thanks their support he will be able to make repairs to his home.  He plans to repair some water pipes and refurbish the walls since they are very cracked.  In this way, he will continue working and fighting to make his ultimate dream come true: having his own home since right now he is renting.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1191343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to make home repairs such as repairing water pipes and walls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-09-22T21:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-22T21:00:12Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":113.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":119.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":123.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":128.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.22},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.71},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.19,"local_amount":104.84,"processed_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":106.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308109362,"comment":null},{"amount":43.22,"local_amount":110.02,"processed_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":112.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345586,"comment":null},{"amount":44.71,"local_amount":113.81,"processed_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":116.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954788,"comment":null},{"amount":46.78,"local_amount":119.08,"processed_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":121.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089194,"comment":null},{"amount":48.54,"local_amount":123.54,"processed_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":126.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478739,"comment":null},{"amount":23.08,"local_amount":58.76,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":59.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776504,"comment":null},{"amount":27.48,"local_amount":69.95,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":71.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779487,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-23T15:17:41Z","paid_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":473616,"name":"Vangie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vangie is a responsible and loving mother to her five children.

He is photographed here next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nRami is requesting a loan from FATEN to help cover the costs of purchasing a new engine for the taxi he drives. His loan will increase his taxi's capacity to work extra hours and enable him to take on additional service requests which will improve his family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

In recent years, the private sector has taken advantage of this growth, expanding investment and building shopping malls, residential developments, etc.  Guaman\u00ed now experiences some security problems owing to several night clubs which have been opened in recent years.  However, in spite of this, the locals do not lose hope and they are always coming up with new business ideas that benefit everybody.  They believe that they can make the most of the fact that the area was historically inhabited by the Inca.\r\n\r\nCristina has been selling clothing and cosmetics for three years.  She works five hours a day in this business whilst also caring for her young son.  In spite of the strong competition that exists in her neighborhood, she plans to make progress in fulfilling her dream of owning her own business premises from which she can sell her clothing.  She has requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa so that she can buy a range of clothing and cosmetics to meet her customer demand.  Cristina is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the help they give her and, above all, the business advice she receives which enables her to offer her customers added value both in terms of customer service and the quality of her prices and products."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1197653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothing and cosmetics in order to increase her stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-09-23T12:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-23T12:40:01Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":844.8,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":82.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":84.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":473903,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia es la se\u00f1ora Rosa, Casada y con 2 hijos, ella continua dedic\u00e1ndose a la comercializaci\u00f3n de productos para el hogar, principalmente de productos de limpieza e higiene los cuales comercializa en los diferentes comercios y mercados de la ciudad, Rosa realiza este trabajo hace algunos  a\u00f1os y esta actividad le ha permitido sacar adelante a su familia y con la educaci\u00f3n de sus 2 hijos.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines, like tractors, that will enhance his farming capacity. The photo was taken recently at the previous maize plantation. Jean D'Amour says that the last season went well. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

is 50-year-old Fatmata.  She is married and has 5 children, ages 25, 23, 20,18 and 14. Three of them are schooling and two are employed. She has 1 additional dependent, who lives with her as her sales assistant.  \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Fatmata established her provisions and soft drinks business. She began her business because she wants to provide help to her husband in the running of the home and that is her only source of income. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about Le 640,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

Latacunga is a welcoming city. Its cathedral and the Church of San Francisco exemplify the beauty of religious art, and its cobblestone streets are lined with the brightly colored facades of traditional homes that stand out in the dusty environment. Latacunga comes from the Quichua words \"llacata kunka\" that mean \"God of the Lakes\". In November, the paved streets are filled with people celebrating the joyous feast honoring the Virgen de las Mercedes during the ceremony of Mama Negra, who symbolizes the fertility of the land. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is married to Luis, with whom she has 4 children, ages 8, 11, 12, and 18. To help support her household, she makes brooms, work she learned from her parents. She works 8 hours a day without help. She says her greatest obstacle has always been not being able to continue her education. She only finished elementary school. She has not had easy access to financing, which has complicated the growth of her business. Mar\u00eda wants to strengthen her business, which requires receiving a loan to buy commodities to make a large batch of her product. She expects to generate better income with the investment and give her children a better life.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's greatest dream is to see her children complete their education and have decent careers through which they will contribute to the country's growth. She works hard every day to achieve her dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1197758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to

","en":"Haydalina is 48 years old. She is married and has three adult children. She lives Sauce, a village in the northern part of the country. Sauce is known for its dairy production, cow and pig raising, and typical pork dishes such as pork with cassava, pork adobado (with a spicy sauce), and fried pork. Haydalina been making her living raising pigs for the past seven years. She has encountered a few challenges of late, including low sales because she does not have enough capital to purchase pig feed, which has limited the number of pigs she can raise. She has therefore applied for a loan to buy raw materials that will allow her to satisfy her customers' demands and increase her income. The photo shows Haydalina and her little herd of pigs. Haydalina is grateful for the loan opportunities that Kiva lenders offer people from poor countries with widespread economic deprivation such as Nicaragua."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1190978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to invest

With profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. The photo was taken recently at the previous maize plantation, and she says that the last season went well. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37 percent of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65 percent of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90 percent of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

is from Abasha district of West Georgia. She is 51 years old and lives with her husband and a daughter. The family runs animal husbandry business-they have 4 milk cows and 4 calves. Nani milks the cows and produces cheese products. She also has a nut garden and a plot of land where maize is grown. The family sells on average 300 kg nuts and 800 kg maize per year.  Nani works hard to make some savings and improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for this loan to increase the number of cattle.

\n\n\n\n","en":"Ravshan is 52 years old. He is married and has 3 children in his care. Ravshan grew up in a peasant family and thus is used to hard physical labour. His home region's climate is very favourable to cultivating crops and raising livestock, and so Ravshan has been breeding cattle for over 9 years. He has many customers at the market.\r\n\r\nRavshan would like to develop his business further but lacks funds to do so.

is 44 years old. He is married to a farmer and they have both eight children aged between five and twenty four, they all go to schools. He has been a maize farmer for 10 years. He will use Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo taken recently at the previous maize plantation and says that the last season went well. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He emigrated to the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n at a young age, in search of better opportunities, and put down roots in the municipality of Santa Catarina. He started working in a bakery as an apprentice, and then became a baker himself. He made a lot of sacrifices in order to set up a tiny bakery of his own. He then bought a bicycle and started to sell bread in the streets, helping his business grow. Some time after his bakery became well-established, he left it to his older son and set up a small fruit and vegetable shop with his wife.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

However, Simon is worried that he will be unable to complete his studies due to the economic conditions of his underprivileged family. His parents are separated. His father is dead and his mother does not have any special skills for work. Right now, his brother who works at a store, finances Simon's education. Simon hopes to get a loan from Kiva so that he can take care of the problem of the cost of tuition. Simon hopes the lenders will help him realize his dream of working as a ship tekniksi, being a professional and making his mother happy."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1197878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay education fees for three years","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"CILACAP","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":253,"posted_date":"2012-09-23T22:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-23T22:10:08Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":61,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T19:40:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":473983,"name":"Dionafe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Dionafe, 43, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

","en":"Martha is 25 years old.  She is married to 35-year old Jaime, who is a machine operator.  They have three children who are 11, 10 and 7 years old.  They live in the south of Quito, the capital of the Republic of Ecuador.  More specifically, they live in the Chimbacalle neighborhood, which is emblematic of Quito primarily for being the home of the Capital's only train station. It is going to be converted into a railway museum which, on par with neighboring museums, has become one of the most visited tourist attractions in the country.  In addition this attraction, in the last few years, the southern area of Quito has developed remarkably, both urban-wise and financially.  Investors have bet on planting their ideas in various key points of this sector.  \r\nMartha grew up in Chimbacalle in a low-income family.  She was able to finish primary school.  She got married very young, and thanks to what a friend taught her, she decided to earn some money by making \u201cespumilla,\u201d an Ecuadorian dessert (similar to a meringue) loved by children and adults alike.

She earns a minimum of PHP 3,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a loan of PHP 8,000.  She will be using the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nGemma hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than the raw food.  Lolita's regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Lolita is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan.

She hopes to grow her rice fruitfully in order to sell it for a good price so as to improve her standard of living and keep her child in school.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":834,"image":{"id":1197241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy fertilizer for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Kror Kor district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-24T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-24T01:20:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yoeurn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Theany","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":668000},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":668000},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":668000},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":668000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":668000},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":660000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":167,"local_amount":668000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":677519,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265978,"comment":null},{"amount":167,"local_amount":668000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":677519,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841450,"comment":null},{"amount":167,"local_amount":668000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":677519,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942108,"comment":null},{"amount":249.5,"local_amount":998000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1012221.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429641588,"comment":null},{"amount":83.5,"local_amount":334000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":338759.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440091780,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T09:42:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
