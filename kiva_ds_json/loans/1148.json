Her husband left her and does not provide any child support so she is raising the children on her own. She has been running her own business for five years. At first she sewed women's clothing, but switched to selling groceries because of the higher demand for food than for clothing. She sells canned goods, pasta, sugar, bread, and laundry detergents. She wants to expand her business and has asked for a loan of 3000 somoni to buy more grocery products and increase her working capital. She awaits your kindness.

In time, Mary began to diversify her merchandise and offer a bigger variety of products, responding to the orders her customers put in.

Mary's personal goals include seeing her children graduate from college. Her business goals include one day opening a well-equipped store and further improving her sales. Challenges she faces in reaching this goal are gaining greater competency with her beauty products and marketing her massage services. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Mary is applying for a Kiva loan in order to buy perfume, capillary creams, disposable towels, and other supplies she needs in order to improve the services she offers and increase her earnings.

","en":"Matlub is a cheerful man, age 52.  He is married and has three children.  He lives with his family in rural area.  Two of his sons are grown and help him with his work. To have a stable income, Matlub works with livestock.  His wife helps him and takes care of the cows while they are being fattened.  She also sells the dairy products provided by the cows' milk.  Matlub not only works with animals, he is also the head of a cooperative farm in his village.  He receives good profits from his business.  Now, the family's expenses are increasing since his sons have their own wives and children that need to be provided for.

Since she was little she has contributed to the household chores, and she was very young when she married. Her husband Nelson, 53, works as a professional chauffeur. The couple do not have any children living at home. They live in Latacunga, a place which has a number of attractions for national and international tourists, including the city's historical centre, which has been considered part of Ecuador's cultural heritage for nearly 30 years and is capital of one of the provinces of Ecuador's Sierra region, and the Cotopaxi volcano. In recent years, the city has developed considerably and is now considered one of the most important in the region, thanks to the flower, mineral, metal, agriculture and farming industries. There are also several businesses generating significant revenue, helping to convert the city into a commercial centre with opportunities for people to get ahead. Despite a poverty rate of over 50%, people have looked for a way to move forward and to make their ideas a reality.\r\n\r\nFor 20 years, Judith has run a convenience store which is open from very early in the morning to the evening, for 10 hours or more every day. When she has free time in her shop, she makes extra money by sewing. Judith wants to stock up her shop with new products which will generate a better income and attract more customers. Her biggest difficulty has been bureaucracy; financial institutions have put various obstacles in the way of her getting the loan she wants to use to expand her business to sell first aid products and sweets. Therefore, Judith has asked for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, with whom she found the reliability, flexibility and openness she had been looking for. She is thankful to Kiva for enabling people around the world to be part of her dream. Judith hopes that she will be able to use the additional income to support her children, who at times struggle economically, and she would also like to reinvest in her business by buying new merchandise.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1373463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to stock up her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-20T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-20T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1635.76,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":124.44},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":127.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":130.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":132.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":136.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":138.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":141.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":145.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":147.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":151.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":154.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572850,"name":"Mahmoud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mhamoud is 25 years old from Gaza.

luego le impartieron el emp\u00edrico conocimiento del trabajo con todo lo relacionado con la agricultura. Actualmente est\u00e1 casado con Mar\u00eda quien tiene 43 a\u00f1os y trabaja como ama de casa y tambi\u00e9n ayudando a Julio en las labores del campo. Viven solos en el Cant\u00f3n de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. Los productos agr\u00edcolas m\u00e1s comercializados son granos como arveja, fr\u00e9jol, lenteja, haba y tambi\u00e9n varias frutas y verduras. La producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados abastece la distribuci\u00f3n interna y el excedente se env\u00eda a la Regi\u00f3n Costa en productos ya procesados. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nJulio aprendi\u00f3 las labores del campo desde que era un ni\u00f1o y luego las convirti\u00f3 en su trabajo habitual para poder llevar siempre el sustento a casa. Ya lleva 30 a\u00f1os en la labor de sembrar, cosechar y comercializar papas y chochos, adem\u00e1s de criar ganado para la producci\u00f3n de leche o para la posterior venta de los animales. Su esposa es de gran ayuda en esta actividad, pues las ocasiones que Julio sale a vender, ella alimenta a los animales o prepara la tierra en donde est\u00e1n los cultivos. Julio invierte al menos 6 horas a su negocio y cada vez tiene la expectativa de verlo crecer, sin embargo la dificultad de obtener cr\u00e9ditos para capitalizar el negocio, ha sido muy grande y no ha podido acceder a los cr\u00e9ditos de financieras comunes. Gracias al apoyo, credibilidad, agilidad y confianza que le brindaron en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, Julio ha decidido solicitar un cr\u00e9dito el cual lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de ganado para la producci\u00f3n de leche y adem\u00e1s la posterior venta de los animales. Julio est\u00e1 entusiasmado porque al fin tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de ver crecer a su negocio y con esto generar mayor utilidades que le permitan brindar un mejor estilo de vida a su esposa y a \u00e9l y adem\u00e1s les permita tener un ahorro para solventar gastos futuros de salud y falta de trabajo que puedan presentarse con la edad avanzada. Julio agradece a todos quienes a trav\u00e9s de la gesti\u00f3n de Kiva puedan ser parte de este crecimiento en su vida y les motiva a seguir apoyando los emprendimientos y microempresas de las personas que como \u00e9l sue\u00f1an con tener calidad de vida en sus hogares.","en":"Julio is a man of 56. He grew up in a country household where he received the support to complete his primary school. Later, they imparted to him the practical knowledge of work in everything related to agriculture. Currently he is married to Maria, who is 43 and works as a housewife and also helps Julio with the farmwork. They live alone in Salcedo canton, located in the eastern part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces in the Ecuadorian highlands. \r\n\r\nIn Salcedo there are various tourist attractions such as lakes and beach resorts which offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists. However the main activity that is carried on in this town is agriculture, and it to a lesser extent cattle raising. The most important agricultural products are staples such as  peas, beans, lentils, lima beans and also various fruits and vegetables. The production of milk and its byproducts supplies internal distribution and the excess is sent to the coastal region as processed products. Cattle raising is also well-suited to this area because of the pleasant climate which is enjoyed in the canton. \r\n\r\nIn spite of these productive activities, there are very worrisome indices of illiteracy and poverty, due unsatisfied basic needs such as sewage systems, which only 25% of the households have. \r\n\r\nJulio learned farmwork from the time he was a child and later made it his everyday work so as to always be able to support his household. He has been 30 years sowing, harvesting and selling potatoes and chochos (a food legume)  besides raising cattle for milk production. His wife is a great help in this activity as on the occasions when Julio goes out to sell, she feeds the animals or prepares the land where the crops are. \r\n\r\nJulio spends at least six hours in his business and each time has the hope of seeing it grow. However the difficulty of obtaining credit for capitalizing the business has been very great and he has not been able to access loans from regular banks. \r\n\r\nThanks to the support, credibility, expeditious service and trust they offer at Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, Julio has decided to request a loan which he will invest in the purchase of cattle for producing milk and for subsequent sale. Julio is enthusiastic because he will have the opportunity to see his business grow and with this generate greater profits which will allow him to offer him and his wife a better standard of living. In addition, it will allow them to have savings for meeting future health expenses and lack of work, both of which needs can arise with advanced age. \r\n\r\nJulio is grateful to those who through Kiva can be part of this growth in his life, and encourages them to continue supporting the business ventures of people, who like him, dream of having a better quality of life in their households."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":621.04,"image":{"id":1373412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle and increase his production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salcedo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-20T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-20T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":84.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":85.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":90.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":94.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":95.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":97.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":101.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":104.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.49},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.24},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":167.79,"local_amount":166.47,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":167.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565408,"comment":null},{"amount":86.63,"local_amount":85.96,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":86.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814446,"comment":null},{"amount":88.52,"local_amount":87.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":88.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320619,"comment":null},{"amount":90.95,"local_amount":90.24,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":90.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856309,"comment":null},{"amount":92.38,"local_amount":91.65,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":92.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059884,"comment":null},{"amount":94.77,"local_amount":94.03,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":94.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995227,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-10T00:57:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573420,"name":"Colonia Zapata Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo \"Colonia Zapata\" esta ubicado en una comunidad muy bonita, caracterizada por la siembra de su ma\u00edz pero sobre todo porque los vecinos de la misma comunidad son muy amables siempre. El grupo lo conforman seis mujeres muy trabajadoras siempre pensando en el bienestar de su familia. Do\u00f1a Andrea, uno de los miembros, coment\u00f3 \"Fue nuestra opci\u00f3n porque en esta misma comunidad hay otro grupo que tiene un nombre muy parecido\" Do\u00f1a Andrea tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Germ\u00e1n quien trabaja como alba\u00f1il, juntos han formado una familia con cuatro ni\u00f1os que aun dependen de ellos. Tres ni\u00f1os a\u00fan se encuentran estudiando. Do\u00f1a Andrea se dedica a la engorda y venta de borregos desde hace 10 a\u00f1os. Esta vez esta solicitando el credito para comprar mas borregos y pastura, los compra medianos solo para engordarlos por un tiempo para despu\u00e9s venderlos, comenta como inicio su actividad. Desde peque\u00f1a, Andrea que perdi\u00f3 a su madre, ayudaba a cuidar los borregos de su padre porque mientras \u00e9l trabaja tambi\u00e9n se dedicaba a la cr\u00eda de borregos para su venta y as\u00ed obtener un ingreso mas para solventar los gastos de sus hermanos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os. \"Cuando me case  yo tambi\u00e9n quer\u00eda ayudar a mi esposo con los gastos de mis hijos y gracias al cr\u00e9dito he podido hacer crecer el numero de mis borregos.

The group consists of six very hard-working women who place the welfare of their families above all else. One of the members, Do\u00f1a Andrea, noted, \"It was our choice because there is another group in the community with a very similar name.\"  She is 42 and married to Germ\u00e1n, a construction worker. They have four children who are all still dependents, three of whom are in school. For ten years, Do\u00f1a Andrea has raised sheep and sold them. She buys the sheep young for the sole purpose of fattening and selling them. She is requesting this loan to purchase more sheep and feed. Do\u00f1a Andrea began to help care for her father's sheep when she was a young girl and her mother died. She helped her father increase the family's income to meet the expenses of her raising her younger siblings. \"When I got married, I also wanted to help my husband with the cost of raising our children. A loan helped me raise more sheep. Raising sheep is very good because many times we can sell them when we don't have money, which gets us through tough times. The only problem Do\u00f1a Andrea has had in the past ten years has been when her sheep become sick and die. Sheep deaths represent losses of both income and investments to Do\u00f1a Andrea. She therefore tries to take excellent care of them and has a veterinarian examine them every two to three months. Do\u00f1a Andrea works long hours caring for her sheep so she can provide her children an education. Her dream is for one of the children to have a professional career. The other members of the \"Colonia Zapata\" group are very happy and grateful to KIVA and Vision Fund because they'll be able to invest in their businesses.

He took the SBA\u2019s advice, applied for a loan, and was pleased with Accion\u2019s smooth process.

Darryl primarily uses word of mouth to advertise but is open to venture into social media.  He is eager to gain more business and keep shining.  He also looks forward to working with Accion again.\r\n\r\nHe enjoys each day the family is able to learn and work together.

Members of this community have remained loyal to their customs and traditions, one of the most important being the Mazahua language. The group members decided on their name because they all make embroidered handicrafts. Do\u00f1a Alejandra, a new member of the group, is 51 and has for 28 years been married to Marcos. They have four children who are all independent. Do\u00f1a Alejandra has made handicrafts for forty years, having learned embroidery very young because her mother was also an embroiderer. Do\u00f1a Alejandra explained, \"Knowing how to embroider is a tradition. If someone here doesn't know how to embroider, it's as if that person didn't live in the community because this  skill is a part of our customs.\" Do\u00f1a Alejandra sells handicrafts from her home and has no difficulty making them. She is seeking this loan to purchase materials such as needles, yarn, wool thread, etc. \"The loan will help me greatly because it will allow me to purchase materials more easily.\" Do\u00f1a Alejandra's challenge is the lack of a market where she can sell her handicrafts. It's difficult to earn a good income in her community and surrounding towns. \"I'd like to find a way to help us identify a good market or some other way to offer our crafts,\" she explained. Do\u00f1a Alejandra and the other group members share the goal of improving their families' quality of life. They each strive diligently to earn a better income so they can meet their household expenses: children's education, clothing, shoes, and more food.

Byron que actualmente tiene 29 a\u00f1os y es copropietario del negocio familiar y adem\u00e1s trabaja en transportes que viajan fuera de la ciudad hasta la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador. Tienen 2 hijos; Kevin que tiene 10 a\u00f1os de edad y Britany que cuenta con 2 a\u00f1itos, Kevin estudia en la escuela p\u00fablica de la ciudad y Britany a\u00fan est\u00e1 al cuidado de su madre en casa. Esta familia esforzada vive en Latacunga capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador y que los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. \nMary se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de bloques de cemento desde hace 9 a\u00f1os aunque ya conoc\u00eda sobre esta actividad de toda su vida, pues en su familia tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a lo mismo. Ella junto a su esposo dedican al menos 9 horas cada d\u00eda a la preparaci\u00f3n de materiales, mezcla, forma y terminado de los bloques. En los \u00faltimos d\u00edas la demanda ha incrementado y la falta de material no le permite cumplir con todos sus clientes, mucho m\u00e1s cuando en \u00e9poca de lluvia los bloques tardan m\u00e1s tiempo con el proceso de secado. Es por esto que Mary ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que le permita comprar quintales de cemento y arena al por mayor para conseguir a mejor precio y as\u00ed incrementar la producci\u00f3n lo que por ende, le generar\u00e1 mayores utilidades para un d\u00eda poder hacer realidad su sue\u00f1o de comprar un cami\u00f3n para poder hacer entregas a domicilio. Mary agradece la apertura y confianza que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa ha tenido con ella, ya que muchas veces se le dificult\u00f3 la obtenci\u00f3n de un cr\u00e9dito en otras entidades financieras. Mary env\u00eda mucha gratitud a quienes alrededor del mundo y a trav\u00e9s de Kiva, est\u00e1n aportando para que la calidad de vida de su familia mejore. ","en":"Mary is a 28 year old young woman.  She went to school through primary school.  She got married when she was very young to Byron who is now 29 years old and the co-owner of the family business.  He also works in transportation, traveling outside the city to the coastal region of Ecuador.  They have two children, Kevin, who is 10 years old, and Britany, who is 2. Kevin studies at the public school in the city and Britany stays at home with her mother.  \r\n\r\nThe family lives in Latacunga, the capital of the Cotopaxi province, which is one of the provinces that forms part of the Sierra region of Ecuador.  In the last few years it has developed and is considered one of the most important in the region thanks to the flower, mineral, metallurgy, agro-industry, farming, and livestock industries.  In addition, there are businesses that generate interesting income that make it a commercial city with various opportunities to get ahead.\r\n\r\nMary has worked for nine years making cement blocks.  She has known this activity all her life since all of her family work doing the same thing.  Together with her husband, she works at least nine hours a day preparing the materials, mixing, forming, and finishing the blocks.  Recently, demand has increased and a lack of materials prevents her from serving all of her customers.  In addition, in the rainy season, the blocks take more time to dry.  This has led Mary to request a loan to purchase 46 kilogram sacks of cement and sand at wholesale so that she gets a better price.  This will allow her to increase production so that she will generate higher profits.  One day she hopes to realize her dream of purchasing a truck to be able to make deliveries to her customers' homes.  Mary appreciates the openness and trust that Fundacion Alternativa has in her since many times it has been difficult to obtain a loan from other financial entities.  Mary sends much gratitude to everyone around the world that is making her family's quality of life improve through Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1373507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to purchase materials and tools to increase her production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-21T01:10:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-21T01:10:23Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Jeaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1060.54,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":172.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":176.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":180.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":183.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":187.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.29,"local_amount":160.11,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":162.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565409,"comment":null},{"amount":174.75,"local_amount":172.4,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":174.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814447,"comment":null},{"amount":178.51,"local_amount":176.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":178.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320620,"comment":null},{"amount":182.74,"local_amount":180.28,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":182.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856310,"comment":null},{"amount":376.71,"local_amount":371.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":376.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059885,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-22T14:53:37Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572867,"name":"Astone","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Astone is requesting a loan to complete paying for his car that he had acquired on a debt so that he could lobby for various contracts. \r\n\r\nHe is an engineer who has retired from active service in government and now does contracts with various institutions.

Est\u00e1 casado con Rosa de 30 a\u00f1os que trabaja realizando los quehaceres dom\u00e9sticos de su hogar, tienen 2 hijos de 13 y 11 a\u00f1os que se encuentran estudiando en un colegio p\u00fablico, y a quienes esperan darles la oportunidad de estudiar que ellos no tuvieron. Jaime con su familia viven en Latacunga capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador y que los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. Aunque hay un alto \u00edndice de pobreza el esp\u00edritu emprendedor de sus habitantes ha hecho que la  ciudad sobresalga. En el sector rural y urbano se puede encontrar familias destacando sus talentos para emprender con alguna idea que les pueda generar rentabilidad para conseguir el sustento diario. \nJaime desde hace 6 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con su carpinter\u00eda que juntamente con su esposa la atienden y a la que dedica entre 6 y 8 horas diarias, con el paso del tiempo ha logrado conseguir clientes que siempre le buscan por entregar un producto terminado de calidad, sin embargo cuando empez\u00f3 su negocio fue dif\u00edcil  que confiaran en \u00e9l por ser muy joven.

They always supported him but he was only able to pay for primary school.  With that knowledge, he was able to get ahead and succeed in his field.  He is married to Rosa, who is 30 years old, and takes cares of their home.  They have two children who are 13 and 11 years old who are studying at the public high school.  They hope to give them the opportunity to study that they did not have.  \r\n\r\nJaime and his family live in Latacunga, the capital of the Cotopaxi province, which is one of the provinces that form part of the Sierra region in Ecuador.   In the last few years it has developed and is considered one of the most important in the region thanks to the flower, mineral, metallurgy, agro-industry, farming, and livestock industries. In addition, there are businesses that generate interesting income that make it a commercial city with various opportunities to get ahead.  Although there is a high level of poverty, the entrepreneurial spirit of the inhabitants have made it a city that stands out.  In the rural and urban areas, it is possible to find families using their talents to undertake an idea that can generate profits to support their daily expenses.  \r\n\r\nJaime has worked for six years as a carpenter.  Together with his wife, they attend the business and work between six and eight hours a day.  With the passage of time, he has succeeded in finding customers who always look for a well-finished product.  When he started his business, it was difficult to trust him since he was very young.  Jaime dreams of having his own furniture factory.  Every day he makes an effort to improve his work so that he can gain more customers and more experience.  One of the obstacles he has overcome is the difficulty in obtaining a loan that will allow him to acquire the necessary wood and working tools at wholesale.  This is why he has requested a loan to purchase wood and carpentry materials that will allow him to produce more and better products with more efficiency so that he can become well-known for his work.\r\n\r\nJaime is grateful to Fundacion Alternativa for opening their doors with trust and training so that he can grow his business.  He is encouraged by the people who are supporting him through Kiva so that he can achieve his dreams and provide his family with a better way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":596.46,"image":{"id":1373588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to purchase wood and carpentry materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-21T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-21T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime Oswaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1668.53,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":107.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":109.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":111.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":115.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":121.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.48,"local_amount":80.17,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":80.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565411,"comment":null},{"amount":98.5,"local_amount":98.12,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":98.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814449,"comment":null},{"amount":100.62,"local_amount":100.23,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":100.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320622,"comment":null},{"amount":103.75,"local_amount":103.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":103.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856312,"comment":null},{"amount":105.02,"local_amount":104.61,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":105.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059887,"comment":null},{"amount":108.09,"local_amount":107.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":108.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995229,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-26T10:19:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573457,"name":"Gloria Marlen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Gloria tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, madre de 5 hijos los cuales ayudan en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su pareja en las diferentes actividades que se realizan en el campo.

Juntos viven actualmente en Latacunga, la capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador. En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os Latacunga se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. En esta ciudad muchas de las fiestas conservan un profundo arraigo y pureza muy cercanos a los or\u00edgenes hist\u00f3ricos o de la tradici\u00f3n ancestral.\nRosa al ver la necesidad econ\u00f3mica en su hogar, decidi\u00f3 desde hace un a\u00f1o, aportar con los gastos del hogar, dando el paso de emprender en un negocio de comercializaci\u00f3n de frutas y verduras, ubicado en un lugar estrat\u00e9gico de la ciudad en donde la mayor\u00eda de sus clientes son amas de casa. Rosa permanece en el local que es rentado atendiendo la demanda de sus clientes durante 10 horas cada d\u00eda, con la esperanza de que todos sus productos se vendan, pues al ser productos perecibles, se deterioran al poco tiempo y no es conveniente arriesgarse a perder sus clientes por no vender productos frescos, lo cual en el caso de ventas bajas significa una p\u00e9rdida. Desde el establecimiento de su negocio, Rosa ha intentado adquirir un pr\u00e9stamo en varias instituciones financieras, lo cual no ha sido posible por no cumplir con todos los requisitos que all\u00ed le piden y adem\u00e1s porque lleva poco tiempo con su negocio.

She completed elementary school and has lived with her partner Luis since she was very young. They have lived together for many years and have three children who are 21, 20 and 12 years old, presently students, who they hope to see become excellent professionals. They currently live together in Latacunga, the capital of Cotopaxi province, one of the provinces that make up part of Ecuador's mountainous region. In recent years Latacunga has developed markedly in such a way that it is considered one of the most important towns of the region due to its industries, such as flower growing, mining, metallurgy, agroindustry, farming and livestock raising. In addition, there are business establishments that produce significant revenue which makes it a commercial city with many opportunities to get ahead. In this city many of the festivals maintain deep roots and a purity that is very close to the historical origins and the ancestral tradition.\r\n\r\nRosa could see the economic need in her household so one year ago she decided to contribute to the costs of the home, taking the step of beginning a business selling fruit and vegetables. It is located in a strategic part of the city where the majority of her clients are housewives. Rosa is present in the rented premises filling the requests of her customers for 10 hours a day, with the hope that all her products will sell, since being perishable products they will deteriorate in a short time. It is not a good idea to take the chance of losing her customers by not selling fresh products, so if her sales are low she sustains a loss. From the time her business was established, Rosa has been trying to obtain a loan from various financial institutions but this has not been possible because she cannot fill all their requirements and because her business has only been open for a short time.

He has five children and has lived in this community for about four years. He built his house on asphalt. It is the property of the government and they enjoy right of possession. Like many others, Don Herminio grew up in the country and learnt how to do many activities pertaining to agriculture and caring for livestock by working as a day labourer and from his own experience in growing subsistence crops. He later married and he and his family got ahead by working together. It was due to social security problems and health problems that he migrated from his birthplace. He later adapted to the ways of life of his new community. Breaking stones and traditional small-scale fishing in Laguna El Jocotal are the activities the majority of families do for a living. Now he makes a living by producing staple grains, especially corn, which he is going to grow in a plot of land he has leased on the outskirts of the community for the rainy season since there is no farming land where he lives as they practically live on a layer of solidified lava.\r\n\r\nHe buys the supplies for his crops from a supplier in the area since it is better to buy them in his own community because of his age and because of the additional costs incurred if he were to buy them elsewhere. He then carries them on his back with the help of his wife and one of his children for approximately 1.5 kilometres. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to fertilize 0.85 square kilometres of land ready to plant corn and he will also prepare the rest of the land for planting in the second season beginning on August 15. By doing this, he will not have to buy corn at expensive prices for his family to eat, which is good as he sometimes does not have enough money to buy what he needs due to the sporadic nature of his work as a day labourer.\r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to work with his own capital and repurchase some calved cows he had before. He had to sell them when he had kidney problems. Now he is healthy but he lacks the resources to guarantee an income for his family and paid studies for his children.

He is married and has one son. Ahmad loves his family very much and tries to raise his only son so that he will be a good human being in the future. Ahmad lives with his family in a small village. During his young years Ahmad finished accounting courses and to this day works as an accountant in the local government. But the salary which he receives there is not enough for normal living. This is why Ahmad together with his wife decided to start own business to get additional income. This business is mainly done by his wife because Ahmad spends all day at his job. Ahmad's wife does animal husbandry, takes care of the cattle and gets the milk which then resells. At this time they have three heads of cattle, but Ahmad wants to gradually expand his business, increase the headcount of cattle and get more income from it. This is why he wants to take out a loan to buy cattle and has come for the loan to Arvand. Ahmad hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand for the help and support in advance.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1369851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-21T10:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-21T10:30:10Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahmad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":393.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":402.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":411.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":421.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":430.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":439.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":393.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":402.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":421.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":439.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T10:30:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573947,"name":"Mirna Jeannette","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"MIRNA TIENE 31 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD, ESTA ACOMPA\u00d1ADA Y TIENEN TRES HIJOS DE 7, 12 Y 15 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD RESPECTIVAMENTE.

She has been working from home ever since she got married over 15 years ago.  After having her first child the household expenses began to increase and the income from her husband's work as a bricklayer was not enough to cover all the family's needs.  She was initially able to see a business opportunity in running a Nixtamal mill.  Then she bought a grill to make pupusas (stuffed tortillas) which she sold on the week ends.  On the other days she was able to sell tortillas.  She gets up very early every morning to prepare what she needs to make the tortillas.  Her first customers begin arriving at 7:00 a.m. and before that she has to get the children dressed and off to school.  The youngest two are in 1st and 6th grade and the oldest goes off to another community to study 9th grade.\r\n\r\nCorn is the main raw material for Mirna and she buys it from the producers in the area.  She buys her other supplies in the city with is 15 kilometers away so she either takes the only available bus or rides in a pick-up truck that covers the route.\r\n  \r\nThe loan she is requesting through Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy corn and have enough inventory for the rainy season.  She also will buy other products such as coffee, dairy products, sausage, beans, rice, sugar, etc. to sell to her customers when they come for the tortillas.  She also wants to plant seven acres of corn crop.\r\n\r\nWith this investment she hopes to expand and grow her business because the opportunity is there and she believes her expenses will increase as her children advance in school.  Her oldest daughter has to continue high school in the city and Mirna wants all her children to continue their education.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she and her husband want to build a new brick house on a lot they received from the government.  Now they live in an adobe house with a cement wall that they built on land that belonged to a ranch but was abandoned.

He has amassed a lifetime of experience, starting when his parents left their home when Jos\u00e9 was three to do farm labor. Jos\u00e9's parents worked growing cotton and corn and doing various other tasks on a ranch. His father was the foreman and taught Jos\u00e9 everything there is to know about raising the region's traditional crops, preparing him for a lifetime of farm work. Today, Jos\u00e9's grandchildren help him work his farm and raise calves. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has to drive a pickup truck to the city, 12 kilometers away, to purchase agricultural supplies. He then drives back to his farm, where he, his children, and grandchildren carry everything 0.5 - 1.2 km on their backs. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is requesting a loan from the Campo Foundation to pay rent for the land he farms, repair fences, and purchase all of the supplies he needs for the planting, care, and harvest of corn and sorghum crops. The loan will provide working capital to produce grains that are the heart of Salvadoran families' daily diet (1 hectare corn, .45 hectare sorghum), for controlling weeds, and raising chickens and calves in the dry season.  \r\n  \r\nIf the rainy season, with God's blessing, leads to a good harvest, Jos\u00e9 hopes to purchase more land. His main goal is to teach his grandchildren to work and to show love and respect for nature. Jos\u00e9's grandchildren will no doubt go to school and become professionals, but a good man knows how to earn a living any honorable way he can, by the sweat of his brow.

Her husband owns a fruit shop in the market, which is the only source of income for the family. He sells apples, bananas and oranges in his shop. \r\n\r\nCurrently, he is interested in offering more variety to his customers, which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However, due to the lack of funds, he finds it difficult. Therefore, his wife, Mariam, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at a profitable price. \r\n\r\nWith the profits expected from this loan, he intends to purchase a refrigerator for preserving food.

She is secretary to the group \"LAS GARDENIAS\", which is made up of 6 hard working borrowers who have already been through 11 loan cycles.\n\nElizabeth has worked as a street trader selling food for 15 years. In her spare time she provides laundry services. This is how she helps her husband with the household costs.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nGenadi requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Genadi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Genadi will purchase a milking cow. After purchasing a milking cow, he will produce cheese to sell. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":236.07,"image":{"id":1372920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a milking cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Sergieti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-21T15:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-21T15:10:20Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":61.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":65.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":66.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":68.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":70.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":72.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.18},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.81},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.26,"local_amount":53.21,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":55.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613759,"comment":null},{"amount":38.17,"local_amount":61.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":63.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857471,"comment":null},{"amount":39.25,"local_amount":62.8,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":65.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134121,"comment":null},{"amount":40.81,"local_amount":65.31,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:34Z","rounded_local_amount":67.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107708,"comment":null},{"amount":41.51,"local_amount":66.41,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":68.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255244,"comment":null},{"amount":43.07,"local_amount":68.91,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":71.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019379,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-23T10:54:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573013,"name":"Mlawy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Group Mlawy consists of four ladies who live in Sana`a, Yemen.

With new structure, she hopes the quality and quantity of her pigs will increase. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to the group members for the support, and thanks the Kiva lenders for partnering with them despite being in a very remote area.\r\n\r\nIn the picture are 25 members who all signed the waiver form because they all belong to the group; some are not taking loans this cycle, but intend to take loans during the next cycle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":1372014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy building materials to build an improved pig sty.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-06-21T15:10:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-21T15:10:21Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celesensio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lauben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vereriyano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gastone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Denis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doreen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jonan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":941666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":941667,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":942489.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689653,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":941666,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":942488.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480784,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":941667.01,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":942489.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879936,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":941666.99,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":942489.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983594,"comment":null},{"amount":344.03,"local_amount":893686,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":894466.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635708,"comment":null},{"amount":380.97,"local_amount":989647,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":990510.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863162,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T18:35:17Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:59:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572987,"name":"Kousar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kousar is 48-year-old married woman, the mother of five children.

is 54 years old and a housewife.

He has a handcart on which he sells vegetables on the street and in markets. He purchases a variety of fresh vegetables from the field and sells them at a profitable price. \r\n\r\nPresently he is interested to offer more variety to his customers which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However due to lack of funds, he finds it difficult. Therefore his wife, Bashiran, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to purchase onions, potatoes, tomatoes and carrots from the field and sell them at a profitable price. With the profit her husband wants to grow his business in the future. Bashiran is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. \r\n\r\nYolanda hopes to expand her business and dreams to have their own house and lot. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Como a su compa\u00f1ero de vida le daban un d\u00eda de descanso, aprovecharon ese d\u00eda y lo destinaban a destazar, manifiesta que hacen esta actividad cada 15 d\u00edas y que gracias a Dios le genera ingresos adicionales para su familia     \n\nellos compran los animales para destazo en la misma comunidad la mayor\u00eda de veces con productores de la zona y algunas veces le toca que ir a las plazas mas comunes de semovientes en la ciudad  generando gastos adicionales ya que paga transporte para que le lleven el animal hasta la casa.\n\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para cancelar un saldo pendiente con la instituci\u00f3n  y el resto sera invertido en la compra de ganado bovino para destazo ya que visualizan una oportunidad de negocio en esta actividad; ya que muchos de sus clientes les preguntan por carnes y otros cortes derivados de reses pocas veces lo han hecho por que es mas dif\u00edcil comprar una res ya que es mas cara que un cerdo.\n\n\nCon la inversi\u00f3n,  aumentara el negocio es cierto sera mas trabajo pero haciendo buenas compras se puede sacar ganancias y generar mas ingresos que garanticen primero la estabilidad econ\u00f3mica de la familia, que garantize la satisfacci\u00f3n y retencion de los clientes y que se viva de diferente manera, para su familia por que hoy que tienen ya dos hijas el salario no ajusta para cubrir los gastos de la canasta b\u00e1sica alimentaria como cuando eran solo ellos dos ahora deben mandar a la escuela a la ni\u00f1a mayor y bueno ya pronto la otra ni\u00f1a tendr\u00e1 la edad y deber\u00e1 ir a la escuela \n\n\nEn un futuro esperan que el negocio  siga mejorando y ya no hacerlo cada 15 d\u00edas; si no una vez por semana que las ni\u00f1as estudien y salgan adelante y lleguen a tener una carrera profesional,  hacer mejoras a la casa y porque no hacerla de ladrillo o de bloque ya que ahora la casa es de lamina y bahareque    \n","en":"Ana is 41 years old, she has a partner and two daughters who are 4 and 10 years old. She learned her butchering skills because she she needed to earn money for her family, since her partner's income as a day laborer were not enough to cover household expenses. Since her partner got at least one day off of work, they took advantage of this day and dedicated it to developing butchering skills. She has been doing this every 15 days and thanks to God she has been able to generate additional income for her family. \r\n\r\nThey buy animals to butcher from their local community, most of the time from local producers and other times she goes to the livestock plazas in the city, but this costs her extra money because she has to pay for transportation so that she can get the animals back to her house. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for from Fundacion Campo is to pay the balance with another institution and the rest she will use to purchase livestock for her butcher shop because a good opportunity has presented itself to her. Many of her customers are asking her for her cuts of meat and other cuts that she doesn't have as often because it is difficult to purchase a cow because it is much more expensive than a pig. \r\n\r\nWith this investment, her business will grow, and there will surely be more work but by making smart purchases she will be able to earn higher profits and to generate a higher income that will help her to guarantee economic stability for her family. It will also guarantee the satisfaction and retention of her customers and that she is able to live in a different way.  Today, their current income doesn't allow them to purchase even enough of the basic necessities for herself and her two daughters and her older daughter is going to school now and has school costs, and the younger daughter will also have school costs soon and they want her to go to school. \r\n\r\nIn the future, they hope that their business continues to improve and they can do it more than every 15 days, but rather, once a week so that their daughters can study and continue to get ahead in life and to have a professional career, as well as make improvements to her house because they would like a house made of brick but currently it is made of laminate. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":211.5,"image":{"id":1374309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"purchase cattle.

She lives with her husband and six children on a small farm called \"Gracias a Dios\" in a rural community found in the Nicaraguan department of Jinotega. She makes a living growing coffee along with her family. This has been their main source of income for more than five years. They also plant basic grains for their own family consumption. Elba's farm is certified with the Fair Trade seal, which proves it's compliance with economic, worker, and environmental criteria that this certification requires, in addition to a contribution to the economic development of her community.\r\n\r\nIn the last three cycles she has harvested 70, 120, and 48 quintals [approximately 3,220, 5,520, and 2,208 kilograms respectively] of pergamino coffee. The diminished harvest of her farm in the 2012-2013 cycle was due to the spread of the roya fungus [coffee-leaf rust] in the country. This is disease has a great impact on coffee agriculture. This diminished harvest together with the fall in price in this sector has diminished her liquidity. This is why she has decided to request a loan to take on a comprehensive management plan of her farm.\r\n\r\nWith these resources, this entrepreneur will be able to invest in the purchase of preventative and restorative fungicides as well as supplies to fertilize her coffee farm in order to achieve stability in her harvest production.

She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will enable her to improve the general welfare of her family. In the future, Rugare plans to own a retail shop in town.\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1372991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Masvingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":184,"posted_date":"2013-06-21T20:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-21T20:00:04Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eniya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gamuchirai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rugare","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":278.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":285.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":294.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":304.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":313.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":323.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":313.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":278.19,"local_amount":278.19,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":278.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390623037,"comment":null},{"amount":285.24,"local_amount":285.24,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-03T08:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":285.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399867225,"comment":null},{"amount":294.39,"local_amount":294.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":294.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410355794,"comment":null},{"amount":304.77,"local_amount":304.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":304.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420275047,"comment":null},{"amount":298.35,"local_amount":298.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-30T09:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":298.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430093517,"comment":null},{"amount":339.06,"local_amount":339.06,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":339.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440205402,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-29T13:12:04Z","paid_date":"2014-01-19T10:05:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574053,"name":"Eloy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eloy tiene 38 a\u00f1os vive en su casa propia en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su familia.

Ararat requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from trading in vegetables and greens. They have a counter at the local market and sell the products themselves. Their additional income is Ararat\u2019s son\u2019s monthly salary; he is working at the local beer factory.\r\n\r\nArarat requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ararat has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Ararat will start trading in clothes. He will purchase clothes at wholesale prices and resell them from his counter at the local market.

Four years ago, he began the business after he was let go from the job where he was working. He used his unemployment earnings to begin the business. Initially, he bought the products through a friend who is a businessman until he met the suppliers. Now, he buys directly from them. Luis' goal is to make his business grow and bring his two children forward. His greatest challenge is having enough working capital to be able to buy the products that he sells in larger quantities. This is the reason that he has turned to a loan, his first funding from the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will buy sodas and beer in larger quantities. This way, he will be able to have enough inventory to provide the product that his customers enjoy the most: beer, especially when it is consumed in a place where they can also enjoy playing billiards with their friends."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":457.74,"image":{"id":1374522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"to buy sodas and beer in larger quantities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-06-21T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-21T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Ramos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":129416},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138298},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":142447},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146721},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":151122},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":155656},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":160326},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":165136},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170090},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":175192},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":180448},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":185862},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":191437},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":197181},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":210668}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.59,"local_amount":129416,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":129464.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968357,"comment":null},{"amount":73.3,"local_amount":138298,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":138349.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817533,"comment":null},{"amount":75.5,"local_amount":142447,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":142500.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323809,"comment":null},{"amount":77.76,"local_amount":146721,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":146775.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083036,"comment":null},{"amount":80.09,"local_amount":151122,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":151178.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062387,"comment":null},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":155656,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":155714.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732087,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T15:40:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573148,"name":"Vaginak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"41 year ol Vaginak lives in a small village in Khospio, Akhalkalaki district with his wife, two sons and a daughter.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow and calf. The cow is milked every day to produce dairy products. The family also owns a plot of agricultural land where potatoes, barley and wheat are grown. The entire harvested product and the dairy products are sold at the local markets.\r\n\r\nVaginak requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Vaginak has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Vaginak will start trading fruits and vegetables. He has a mini-bus that will be used for trading. Vaginak will purchase stocks of products and sell them among the villagers and at the local markets.

He lives in a small village in the Angisa, Khelvachauri district with his wife and two children (18 and 21 years old). Mamia requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time due to low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nMamia is an artisan. He is working on renovations and constructions for private orders on a small salary, which is the only source of the income for the family.\r\nMamia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Mamia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Mamia will purchase stocks of groceries to open a grocery shop.

The business has been in operation for 15 years. She says the main challenges faced are of her customers failing to pay on time and high rentals.

capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles. Christian reside en Chillogallo un barrio ubicado en el sector sur de la ciudad, un sector con una alta actividad comercial que es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y que aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios como es el caso de Christian, un hombre 27 a\u00f1os que al haber terminado la secundaria se dedic\u00f3 al comercio primero como empleado y luego independientemente. Christian est\u00e1 casado con Mar\u00eda una mujer de su misma edad dedicada los quehaceres del hogar y con quien tiene el privilegio de haber concebido un par de gemelas que en la actualidad tienen un poco m\u00e1s de 2 a\u00f1os y el d\u00eda de su nacimiento fue muy especial pues al nacer prematuras permanecieron un tiempo den incubadora pero salieron sanas y sin mayores inconvenientes; esto motiv\u00f3 a\u00fan m\u00e1s a Christian para seguir adelante. \nChristian trabajaba como vendedor en una empresa privada, sin embargo sus clientes siempre le recomendaban independizarse, pues \u00e9l conoc\u00eda muy bien sobre los productos que vend\u00eda, por lo que hace un a\u00f1o Christian decidi\u00f3 emprender con su propia microempresa de comercio de productos desechables como platos, cucharas, fundas, tarrinas, etc. en todos los tama\u00f1os para satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes que cada vez son m\u00e1s; pues en un inicio, \u00e9l hab\u00eda comenzado a vender y entregar su producto en las tiendas de las escuelas y colegios y luego fue ampliando poco a poco su negocio hasta tener su propio local donde puede vender otro tipo de art\u00edculos. Christian invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en el desempe\u00f1o de su trabajo, desde que se levanta para distribuir y clasificar los pedidos hasta que termina la tarde contabilizando las cuentas por cobrar y las cuentas que le pagaron en el d\u00eda. Ahora que este joven padre ha ganado experiencia y tiene pleno conocimiento de su mercado, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo con nuevos productos como son los pa\u00f1ales y art\u00edculos para beb\u00e9 y de esta forma amplia su cartera de productos y clientes para ofrecer a su familia un mejor estilo de vida con estabilidad laboral y econ\u00f3mica. Christian agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por creer en sus sue\u00f1os y brindarle la confianza y asesor\u00eda que necesita para saber administrar su negocio y cumplir sus sue\u00f1os y los de su familia.","en":"Not long ago, the southern sector of the city of Quito was not considered one of the stronger economic sectors of the capital of the Republic of Ecuador. Now, this sector is considered a strength of the city's economy. In this place, you can find families who have fought to survive. Between indigenous people and migrants from other cities and countries, it has been a meeting point for inhabitants of various provinces and it has been reconstructed with extensive streets. \r\n\r\nChristian lives in Chillogallo, a neighborhood located in the southern sector of the city, a sector with a high amount of commercial activity that is becoming stronger and stronger, and that contributes greatly to the economic growth of the city. In this sector, there are many parks with large green spaces in which many families spend their weekends. Many different services are available, and the people who live there are businesspeople like Christian who take advantage of every opportunity to establish new businesses. \r\n\r\nChristian, a 27-year-old high school graduate, worked in the commercial sector first as an employee and later independently. He is married to Maria, who is the same age and who completes the household tasks. They have the privilege of having twin girls who are now a little over two years old. The day of their birth was a very special day because they were born prematurely and needed to remain in an incubator for a while. They are now healthy and without major health issues. This further motivates Christian to move forward.\r\n\r\nChristian worked as a salesman in a private business, but his clients always encouraged him to become independent since he knew the products that he was selling very well. A year ago, Christian decided to launch his own small business selling disposable goods like plates, spoons, cases, tubs, etc. in all sizes to satisfy the demands of his growing number of clients. In the beginning, he sold and delivered his products in school stores and later increased his business until he now has his own storefront where he can sell other types of items. \r\n\r\nChristian spends at least 8 hours each day performing his job, from the time he wakes up to distribute and classify the orders until he finishes in the afternoon adding up the bills to charge and the bills that were paid that day. \r\n\r\nNow that this young father has gained experience and has full knowledge of his market, he seeks a loan to invest in new products like diapers and items for babies, and increase his portfolio of products and clients in order to offer a better quality of life to his family with economic stability. Christian thanks Fundacion Alternativa for believing in his dreams and giving him the confidence and advice that he needs to know how to manage his business and achieve his and his families' dreams."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1374501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy diapers and other items for babies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christian Augusto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1353.83,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79.61},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":84.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":87.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":93.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":94.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98.58},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100.91},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":102.87},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.49},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573179,"name":"Paulina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is formed by six members who are successful traders.

is 69 years-old. He lives in a small village in Bolnisi District with his wife, son and daughter-in-law. In the past, Badri has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start-up a family business but without any success. His loan requests have been rejected all the time due to  low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBadri\u2019s wife has a retirement pension and his daughter-in-law works as a teacher at local school. Badri has a plot of agricultural land where cucumbers are grown. He does all the agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. He sells the harvested cucumbers at local markets at a good price. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBadri has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Badri has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.
