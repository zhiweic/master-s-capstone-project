She is married to Alfredo, her business partner. She has three children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMargarita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is a place to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a living by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing this loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMargarita dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work from her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.  She also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1091370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T18:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T18:20:16Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":140.63,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5964,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359354,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2650.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303169,"comment":null},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3313.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355893,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2650.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114027,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1325.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350119,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-10T04:58:09Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:18:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":424161,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanita works hard to support her family.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nZita operates a handicrafts business. What she basically does is buy raw materials used in handicrafts-making from suppliers, manufactures them into different products, and sells them per-piece for a profit. Products range from lanterns, lampshades, and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offered. Her regular customers are the local community.  She earns a minimum of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw materials and supplies needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nZita dreams to expand her business and help her children finish their studies through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She also wanted to help her children get ahead, but she did not have sufficient financial resources to provide them with a better education.  The loan she will receive will be invested in the purchase of more merchandise such as oil, milk, soft drinks, cookies, soups, sugar, beans, eggs, and other items.  Jazm\u00edn wants to continue investing in her business so that it can grow even more.  She plans to expand the facilities of her grocery store so that she can increase and improve her sales and her income.  In addition, she would like to continue supporting her children with their studies so that they can pursue a good profession and have a better quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nJazm\u00edn is extremely grateful to the Kiva lenders and to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  Thanks to their help, she has been able to move forward and have her own business.  Her fellow group members are Ver\u00f3nica, Yolanda, Patricia, and Modesta.  They engage in different business activities such as selling groceries, selling household products, making candy, selling cheese, and operating a sewing workshop.

He notes that the quality of life in his community is at a subsistence level, the majority of residents are independent workers who are involved in commerce and raising of small domestic animals and some of them are also in agriculture.  Carlos lives in the neighborhood of Monte Verde Bajo in the Tambogrande district of the department of Piura, a place where one cannot find basic electrical power and the water consumed in the area is from one artisan well.  Equally, all the families who reside there live under these conditions.\r\n\r\nThe work activity which Carlos is aiming to grow is agricultural.  He has 0.75 hectares of agricultural lands that his father had given to him as an inheritance, where he has planted limes and papaya which show good growth of their vegetation and fruits, which he picks weekly and then sells in the local market of his neighborhood.  This is work he has done for 10 years and has given him a lot of experience, which has allowed him to maintain a clientele of established customers at his business.  His spouse also works and raises small animals and helps him in the work he does, which is to say that they have an excellent family relationship.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Carlos has proposed expanding his inventory in relation to his sales of harvested produce, an idea that is born of it being a very lucrative activity in his area.  It is because of these circumstances that he has chosen to ask for a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 500 Soles, which are intended to buy defoliants, biostimulants, and to pay day laborers for the set up and that in time will permit him to improve his lot in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1086808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy defoliants, biostimulants, and for payment of day laborers for his agricultural lands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande -

The family also owns a tractor, which is out of order and doesn\u2019t work. Shalva\u2019s mother has chronic health problems and receives a relevant pension from the government. Total average monthly income of the family is 250 lari. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nShalva requested credit for repairing the tractor. After it is fixed, Shalva will perform various agricultural services, including tilling the plots. He will get orders from neighborhood farms and will be paid for providing services. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. The tractor will become a new source of  income for the family. They will earn on average 200 lari per month. It will mean an 80% increase in the family\u2019s monthly income. The living conditions of the family will significantly improve and in addition to the above mentioned, the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

The members of the group decided upon this name because it includes the name of their community.  In addition, the group representative has three almond trees at home.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe story being presented is that of Sra. Aurora, the group representative.  She is 64 years old and married to Sr. Luis, who is a field laborer.  They have four children, but only her son Daniel is a student since he is in his first year of high school.  The other three children are already married.  She has been producing and selling utensils made of clay for more than 10 years.  \r\n<p>\r\nAurora says that she decided to start this business because she was looking for a way to help her husband with the household expenses and pay for their son's studies.  At the same time, she wanted to have an improved financial situation and an excellent quality of life.  With respect to her business, Aurora says that when she was a little girl, her mother taught her how to make utensils.  For this reason, she decided to start this venture.  The loan she is receiving will be invested in the purchase of more materials such as firewood and clay, as well as additional utensils so that she can continue her sales.   \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Aurora says that her goal as an entrepreneur is to make her business grow.  She wants to build a small shop since her greatest wish is to open a store where she can sell earthenware and make people in her community aware of what she does.  The loan will also help her to be well-stocked with a greater variety of products so that she can earn more income.  She would like to thank FRAC and the Kiva lenders for giving her this opportunity and trusting her.  Most of all, she is grateful that people believe in her.  With this assistance, she will be able to invest in her business and have a better quality of life and a better future along with her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe members who make up the group \"El Almendro de la Guadalupe\" are Adelina, Hernestina, Mar\u00eda, Guadalupe, Aurora, and Roc\u00edo.  They engage in businesses such as pottery making, making baked goods, and selling soft drinks.

Blanquillos del Charco.  The members selected this name because the community where they live is called El Charco. Several of the members sell fish and eggs.\r\n\r\nThis story is about Francisco because he is the group representative.  He is 40 years old, married to Rosalba, and has three children.  One is in the second year of high school, one is in the second year of middle school, and Adolfo is in fourth grade.  \r\n\r\nFrancisco has been buying and selling livestock for 15 years.  He decided to start this business activity because he wanted to look for the way to get his children ahead.  He also wanted to give them a better education, to give them a better quality of life, and to enjoy good financial solvency.  He will use the loan he was given to buy cows, calves, and corn.\r\n\r\nThe goals that Francisco has set are to make his business grow a lot more, to constantly invest in order to increase the number of animals he has, and to have better sales and production.  This will improve and increase his income so that he can give his family a better standard of living.\r\n\r\nChico (as he is better known in his community) thanks FRAC and Kiva because it is thanks to them that he has been able to make his business grow little by little.  This changes his life and that of his family.\r\n\r\nHis colleagues are Delfino, Francisca, and Leticia.  They devote themselves to different activities like selling fish and marketing livestock (buying and selling cows and calves, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1084542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows, calves, and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ometepec,Gro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-12T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-11T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5599.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6290.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6537.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6850.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7200.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7521.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":530.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":558.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":582.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":434,"local_amount":5599.94,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5605.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419004,"comment":null},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":6290.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6297.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568580,"comment":null},{"amount":2048.19,"local_amount":26428.23,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":26456.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399870,"comment":null},{"amount":130.31,"local_amount":1681.48,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1683.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407567,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-04T11:08:36Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":424566,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon is from Santa Cruz, Tangub City.

All the families from here live under the same conditions.\r\nRogelio is a farmer and he has 2 hectares of agricultural land in which he grows lemons, which grow well. He harvests weekly and later sells the goods in the local market. He has been doing this for 7 years, which has given him plenty of experience and enabled him to maintain loyal customers for his business. His partner works raising small animals and selling fresh chickens from home and he helps her with her work. That is to say, they have a good family relationship. \r\nCurrently, Rogelio is proposing to grow his inventory, that is, increasing the harvested fruit that he sells. This is because this is a very profitable product in the area. For these reasons he is requesting a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa for $575 which he will use to buy fertilizers and food for his animals. In time, this will enable him to improve his quality of life. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1087291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers for his crops and to buy food for his animals.

The quality of life in the community where he lives is subsistence. The majority of inhabitants are independent workers who devote themselves to commerce and small animal husbandry. Some of them also cultivate crops. Lazaro lives in the Manco Inca hamlet in the district of Tambogrande and department of Piura. He has only basic services including electricity, and obtains water by means of a traditional well. All the families who are based there likewise live under these same circumstances. \r\n\r\nLazaro devotes himself to agriculture as he has 6.0 hectares of farmland where he has planted lime and mango crops which are showing good vegetative development. He harvests his crops weekly and then sells them in the area's local market. He has been developing his farming activities for 15 years which has granted him experience. Likewise his spouse devotes herself to raising small animals (sheep and poultry) and supports him in his farming activities. Thus there are good family relations. \r\n\r\nCurrently Lazaro has determined to expand his inventory with respect to the sale of his harvested products, since it is a very profitable activity in the area. Therefore he is seeking a new loan from Edpyme Alternative in the amount of 4,000 Peruvian soles which is to be used for purchasing fertilizers, pesticides and feed for his animals. In time this will allow him to improve his standard of living. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1087298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizers and pesticides for his crops and feed for his animals.

Merziya has more than 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to her father, who taught her the best way to look after cattle and who currently helps her to run the business.\r\n\r\nMerziya usually buys small cattle and sheep, raises, and fattens them in 5-6 months and resells them for more profitable prices in the local livestock bazaar. Meat-selling brings 200 AZN income per month. Beef and mutton are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce. Also, she sells sheep fur, which is useful for clothes and blankets.  \r\n \r\nThis is only one financial income. Merziya applied for 1,200 AZN to purchase two cows and two sheep.

She sells milk and yoghurt to the neighbors. Milk and meat selling brings an income of 150 AZN per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce. Milk products are considered to be very healthy and also are present in everyday life.   \r\n\r\nThis is only one financial income in her family and not enough to cover the basic needs of her beloved children.

She doesn't do the work alone since she counts on the help of her husband who also knows the business.  She doesn't have a fixed schedule because she increases or decreases her production according the orders (she receives).

She was widowed some years ago.  This was a great sorrow because her husband was her right hand, and, above all, she loved him very much.  She has a son who is an adult and is married.  However, he is always looking out for her, and he loves her very much. \r\n\r\nHer house is in a city that is known for having a warm climate year round.  There is a lot of agriculture in this city, especially cotton, asparagus, and paprika, among others.

Vive en La Man\u00e1. Para que conozcan un poquito esta hermosa cuidad les comentamos que el vocablo La Man\u00e1, proviene de \u201cLANG MANA ATTI\u201d, que significa mina del Gran Rey, por existir en el subsuelo abundancia de oro y otros minerales, teor\u00eda que se fortalece con el hallazgo de objetos arqueol\u00f3gicos en especial en el sector de Estero Hondo. Seg\u00fan el vocablo colorado MANA significa \u201cHERMOSO, GRANDE\u201d, que se atribuye a la fertilidad y a la generosidad de su suelo, ya que es apto para todo tipo de cultivo. \nRetomando a nuestra entrevistada Ubaldina nos cuenta que anteriormente trabajaba en una empresa en la cual al dejar de laborar le dieron liquidaci\u00f3n. Con ese dinero inicio sus cabinas telef\u00f3nicas ya que por su sector no hab\u00eda. Fue un gran acierto porque al ser lugar tur\u00edstico le va muy bien, su horario inicia a las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana y cierra a las 9 de la noche.

En un futuro desea adquirir una vitrina y copiadora para agrandar su negocio.","en":"Ubaldina is 46 years old, she is separated and has 3 adult children. She lives in La Man\u00e1. In order to know a little bit about this beautiful city, we will comment that the word La Man\u00e1 comes from \u201cLANG MANA ATTI,\u201d which means Mine of the Great King, because there exists an underground abundance of gold and other minerals, a theory which is strengthened by the discovery of archaeological objects, especially in the area of Estero Hondo. Accordingly, the colorful term \u201cMANA\u201d means \"beautiful, large\" and refers to the generosity of the ground as it is suitable for all types of crops.\r\n\r\nGoing back to our interviewee, Ubaldina tells us that previously she worked at a company but stopped working there as it went into liquidation. With that money she began her telephone booths since there were none in the area. It was a big hit because it is a tourist area and it is going very well. She begins at 7:00 in the morning and closes at 9:00 in the evening. She also sells telephone cards, telephone card recharges, snacks, clothing, and many supplies, and that means she has many clients. With the money from the loan she will buy more inventory including sheets to sell, towels and comforters. In the future she hopes to buy a display case and a copier in order to expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1087463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy telephone cards, clothing, and sheets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quevedo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-05-13T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-12T01:20:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ubaldina Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1049.27,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80.76},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":93.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.1},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.49},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":422531,"name":"Reina Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Reina tiene 53 a\u00f1os de edad, esta acompa\u00f1ado y tiene dos hijos.

their businesses. They are natives of a town called Patria Nueva where citizens are dedicated to cattle, agriculture and mining. Their dances are Chilean and they celebrate the festival of San Mart\u00edn on the 21st of January. This is an area rich in fauna and flora.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Sra. Josefa, 71, who is known for her friendliness. She is happily married to Sr. Isa\u00edas, a kind, hardworking man, who is a farmer.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Josefa has been selling clothing for five years, chickens for three years and perfumes and cosmetics for five years. She says she sells her perfumes in neighboring towns such as Nueva Esperanza, El Santo, El Guayabo and El Platanillo. She decided to start her businesses because she enjoys working and being an independent woman. One of her dreams is to grow her business.

The members of this group are natives of Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca where machetes are made with etchings related to the culture of the region. Another of their handicrafts is the making of traditional clothing. The area is rich in fauna such as the prickly pear, \u201caguacatillo\u201d, \u201cpalmaguapinol\u201d, \u201ccaida\u201d and \u201c\u00e1mate\u201d. Most of the citizens speak the Mixtec language.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Sra. Ana Luisa, 20, who is happily married to Sr. Fredi, with whom she has two daughters, Sonia and Analiz. Ana, as she is better known, has been selling footwear by catalog for four years. She has also been selling groceries for one month. She tells us that her store still does not have much merchandise because, as soon as she opened the business, the little merchandise she has she bought from the profits of her shoe sales. \r\n\r\nAna says that loans were how she began her shoe selling business. First she bought the catalogs, then she went door to door among her neighbors to offer her merchandise and then she bought the footwear to fill their orders. She realized that she was making a good profit and was selling so many shoes that she decided to buy extra pairs and sell them from her home but she still continued selling to her neighbors and in districts in her community. She is very happy because her earnings help her husband with household expenses and her daughters with their school expenses.\r\n\r\nAna says they bought a plot of land in installments so that they could provide an inheritance for their daughters because, with her husband\u2019s earnings they are paying off the land, and her earnings help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan to purchase more grocery merchandise such as cookies, cereal, detergent, coffee, sugar, milk, vegetables, soft drinks, juices, candy, toilet paper, soap, cooking oil, beans and rice.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Felipa Nery, who sells dough and ground corn, Marbelia, who sells Mexican snacks, Juvenal Adauto, who sells household articles and Berenice Janeth, who also sells dough and ground corn. They thank the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping them improve their businesses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":1084416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase groceries to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-13T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-12T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa Nery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marbella ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juvenal Adauto ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana  Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Berenice Janeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7570.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8050.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8381.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8782.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9215.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":585.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":648.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":679.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":713.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":585.82,"local_amount":7570.59,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7607.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419009,"comment":null},{"amount":622.92,"local_amount":8050.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8088.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568585,"comment":null},{"amount":1189.67,"local_amount":15374.23,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":15448.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399875,"comment":null},{"amount":138.46,"local_amount":1789.36,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407569,"comment":null},{"amount":713.13,"local_amount":9215.77,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9260.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120135,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-07T10:31:09Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":424744,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a 29-year-old single mother of four children living in Bundibugyo, Uganda.\r\nShe has been in healthcare services for twelve years working as a nurse.

The total average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nDavid and his mother used to run a dairy farm. They had cows, and the family was producing cheese and selling it. David sold the cows because he needed cash for purchasing a house to live in, as they didn\u2019t have one. Now David has requested credit for restarting the dairy farm. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to the country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit David will start up a small dairy farm. He will purchase two calves and grow them. The calves will be placed in an old cattle-shed located in David\u2019s yard. After half a year he will start the production of cheese and sell it on the local market to dairy products retailers. The income of the family will increase by 250 \u2013 400 Laris, which will mean a 100 \u2013 160% increase. The living conditions of the family will significantly improve and the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

is a 37-year-old farmer who lives with his mother, Yuni, 60 years old and a widow. Markus plants vegetables such as tomatoes and basil. He learned the farming skills from his father. Every day he goes to the farm on foot. The farm is located approximately 500 meters from his house. His mother and brothers accompany and help him when working at the farm. He often harvests the vegetables every month and his mother sells them at a traditional market. The income from selling vegetables helps him meet his family needs. \r\n\r\nMarkus plans to plant more vegetables but he needs more money to buy more seedlings and fertilizer. This situation led him to request a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 4,000,000. Markus is hoping that he can improve the business as well as better meet his family's living costs.

is a 42-year-old lady and married.

Andeling is married, Sonya is studying in University, and Lian is attending 3rd grade of Elementary School. \r\n\r\nNaomi assists her husband in producing extra income for the family by selling cakes and sweet ice. She makes this kind of foodstuff herself. She distributes the products in a school canteen and kiosk near her residence. Sometimes the profit generated from the business is not sufficient in meeting her family's needs as well as the educational needs of Sonya and Lian. \r\n\r\nNaomi met with a TLM loan officer who offered a loan product. She then requested a loan of IDR 12,000,000 from TLM. She would like to spend the loan on Sonya\u2019s university costs and for purchasing more ingredients, i.e. wheat flour, frying oil, bananas, etc. for her business; also she would like to help her husband in enlarging his catfish business. She is expecting that the loan will bring more good impact for the business and family life.
