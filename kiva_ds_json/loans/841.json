For the past 3 years, she has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, she has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like sugar for resale, and that will help Grace generate greater profits and pay for her own school fees. Grace hopes that in the future she will be able to to study up to the university. \r\n\r\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Grace 's future prospects by helping her expand her business that helped her go back to school.

Eva is 22 years old and lives in the town of Wobulenzi in the Luweero region of Uganda. For the past 4 years, she has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells snacks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Eva has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase cooking oil and will help Eva to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her siblings. She hopes that in the future she will be able to study hairdressing. \r\n\r\nEva is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased her future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

Sylvia hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \r\n\r\nSylvia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

is Elizabeth, 40, a resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Armando, her business partner, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.    \r\n                         \r\nElizabeth operates a van rental business. They have one van that they offer to be rented for transportation service or for people who need a van for out-of-town service. They provide their services within the city & nearby provinces. Aside from this she also operates a small tailoring shop for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her van. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He currently lives in the city of Ica. This has meant that he has had to confront major challenges such as the strong winds and tremors near his home.\r\nJuan greatly enjoys playing soccer with his friends after work. Like all good Peruvians, he is crazy about ceviche [a popular seafood dish]. Thanks to his parents, Juan was able to finish school. When he graduated, he truly wanted to study agronomy. However, due to some economic mishaps in his family, his parents were not able to pay his tuition. After that, Juan promised to get himself ahead on his own in a respectable manner, through working hard. For this reason, he works ten hours a day, every day, driving his moto taxi around the city of Ica. This has allowed him to earn the income he needs to cover his daily needs.\r\nJuan is certain that everything will turn out ok, as long as he keeps working and gets up very early, giving his all in order to move forward. Thanks to the support of this loan, he will be able to pay for the renewal of his driver's license. This will also help him toward his goal of attending university and becoming a professional. Juan is very happy for this support because he will be able to keep working when he renews his driver's license and thus pay for his studies. He is set on reaching his goal and demonstrates a great deal of hard work and enthusiasm of reaching his dream: \"To be a successful professional.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1074483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to renew his driver's license and enroll in university.

She thanks Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n for the opportunity she\u2019s receiving because it will be of great help to her.\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1075257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Concepci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2012-04-27T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-27T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5434689,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":391820},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":402070},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":412589},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":423383},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":434459},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":445826},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":457489},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":469458},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":481740},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":494343},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":507276},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":514236}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.72,"local_amount":391820,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":398799.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283143860,"comment":null},{"amount":96.18,"local_amount":402070,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":409232.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286878038,"comment":null},{"amount":98.69,"local_amount":412589,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":419938.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294341156,"comment":null},{"amount":101.28,"local_amount":423383,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":430924.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301397647,"comment":null},{"amount":103.92,"local_amount":434459,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":442198.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308156640,"comment":null},{"amount":106.65,"local_amount":445826,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":453767.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315389457,"comment":null},{"amount":109.43,"local_amount":457489,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":465638.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322996214,"comment":null},{"amount":112.3,"local_amount":469458,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":477820.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331132593,"comment":null},{"amount":115.23,"local_amount":481740,"processed_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":490321.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339521474,"comment":null},{"amount":362.6,"local_amount":1515855,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1542857.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347073320,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-27T05:38:23Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:13:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":417292,"name":"Myriam Candy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

for 11 years - she has her own small cafe.  The cafe is located outside the city, has a small space and fits three tables and a kitchen.  One of the tables is located outdoors.  Siranush says that she has many customers during the summer months, but cannot sit all of them.  This is why Siranush needs a loan in the amount of $2,600 to spend on building and setting up an outdoor cafe, which will allow her to serve up to 50 customers.  Siranush's husband works at this same cafe as a chef.  Siranush's cafe is open until late evening and on weekends.  \r\nSiranush is 37 years old, married and has two children: a son and a daughter.  Her daughter is married and lives separately from the parents.  Siranush's son will soon go to the army.  Siranush's retired father-in-law also lives with them.  This is Siranush's second loan from the Nor Horizon

He grows conventional coffee and is interested in switching over to organic coffee and is willing to get technical assistance to do so and to follow the instructions from technicians from Uni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco [coffee cooperative] to attain said change.\r\n\r\nFor Eleuterio it\u2019s very important to increase and improve his coffee production since this is his main source of work.  Most of his growing fields were passed down from an aunt and the rest were purchased with profits from coffee sales and profits generated from a sugarcane transport truck he owns.  \r\n\r\nHis medium and long range plans are to renew his old plants with new ones to increase production which is why he\u2019s asking for a loan to buy the plants to replant and to pay labor costs to help him mark his parcel and plant his plants increasing production and improving the quality of his coffee to be able to improve his quality of life and attain his greatest hope which is that his children become professionals but without forgetting work in the fields since the parcels he now owns will one day be their inheritance in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1080131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy plants and to pay labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-04-27T17:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-27T17:50:10Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eleuterio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2300,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":30281.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936656,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T07:38:42Z","paid_date":"2013-05-18T09:25:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":419358,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria madre soltera de 56 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su hijo es productora de caf\u00e9 org\u00e1nico, actualmente produce 12 toneladas por cosecha y le gustar\u00eda en un futuro llegar a producir 20 toneladas, ella cuenta con 30 a\u00f1os de experiencia en el cultivo de caf\u00e9 una parte de sus fincas fueron herencia de su padre las dem\u00e1s fueron compradas con las ganancias que le deja la producci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9, en la actualidad se dedica a las labores del hogar y en su tiempo libre al cuidado de su finca, sus metas son lograr mas producci\u00f3n y comprar mas parcelas y por lo consiguiente producir mas y mejor caf\u00e9, su mayor ilusi\u00f3n es poder comprar una camioneta peque\u00f1a que le facilitara el transporte de su caf\u00e9 a la Uni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco que es donde lo vende, por lo cual pide un cr\u00e9dito para realizar sus planes que son comprar plantas para resiembra y compra de fertilizantes org\u00e1nicos para aumentar su producci\u00f3n y obtener una mejor calidad de vida llevando con ello el aumento de su patrimonio y as\u00ed poder comprar su camioneta para facilitar el transporte de su caf\u00e9, jornaleros y fertilizantes que ocupe en el cuidado de su parcela.","en":"Gloria, 56, is a single mother; she lives with her son.

She\u2019s 76 years old and has 50 years\u2019 experience growing coffee since her father would take her to the fields when she was a little girl to help him with the planting and harvesting chores.

","en":"Sotero, 53, is single living with his mother.  He attended elementary school up until sixth grade.  He has 41 years\u2019 experience growing coffee; he inherited all his fields from his father having started working with him at the age of 12 helping with planting and harvesting coffee.  This is his main and only source of support for himself and his mother.  Sotero spends all his time in his fields since he himself does some of the farming chores like pruning and weeding during the plant flowering phase so that when the coffee is ready to be harvested the fields are clear.  He produces organic coffee and currently has 4000 plants in his farm.  He\u2019d like to increase to 6000 productive plants and his goal is to increase production and to buy more land to plant more coffee.\n\nHe has therefore asked for a loan to buy organic fertilizer that will help him increase production and to pay labor costs to hire personnel to help him with the farm chores like pruning, weeding and planting.  He believes that by implementing this in the medium or long term he will increase production and as a result will improve his quality of life as well as his assets and will be able to make improvements to his house and to buy a pick-up truck that is so very much needed to transport the fertilizer and other supplies to his farm.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1080205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy plants and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-04-27T18:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-27T18:20:11Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sotero ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:25:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9216.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936659,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-30T20:37:43Z","paid_date":"2013-05-18T09:25:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":418671,"name":"Lucia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucia lives in West Point along with her husband and children, who are presently in school.

The loan will be used to buy more fruit for resale and will help Faridah to generate greater profits and save her money for future use. Faridah hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \r\n<p>\r\nFaridah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is married with six children and three of her children are in school. She takes care of additional family members (Grandchildren). She sells fish from home and sells to all categories of people but at retail. She has been in this business for the last three years. She has applied for a loan of 2,000,000 Uganda Shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy more boxes of fish.  Besides this fish business, she owns a retail shop. She works seven days a week. Her major business challenges include seasonality and transportation of boxes of fish from the landing site to her home.

de 43 a\u00f1os vive en la linda e hist\u00f3rica ciudad de Cartagena de Indias, con su esposo y sus 2 hijos en las edades de 10 y 12 a\u00f1os. All\u00ed tiene varios negocios, por un lado vende perfumer\u00eda y productos cosm\u00e9ticos en general  y su otra actividad productiva es la venta de gallina, cerdo, pescados y carne de res.  Ruth desde ni\u00f1a ha tenido el negocio como su vocaci\u00f3n principal, pues en la escuela aun recuerda, que era \u201cpilosa\u201d (como ella misma lo dice), pues vend\u00eda fantas\u00edas econ\u00f3micas a sus compa\u00f1eras de clases, llevaba al colegio binchas, aretes, pulseras etc. con las que le ganaba algo de dinero. En su mente siempre ha estado \u201cel ser independiente\u201d generando sus propios ingresos, por eso continu\u00f3 con su actividad comercial cuando termin\u00f3 de estudiar en la escuela. Ella para invertir, preguntaba a sus posibles clientes lo que necesitaban y as\u00ed mismo compraba esa mercanc\u00eda y la ofrec\u00eda,  para que estos se la pagaran en cuotas pactadas. En la actualidad apoya el sustento de su familia, vendiendo directamente lo que compra a proveedores en el centro de la ciudad y tambi\u00e9n mediante gu\u00edas especializadas de productos.  As\u00ed mismo toma pedidos de carnes, gallina, cerdo y vende en su propia residencia,  entre vecinos, amigos, familiares y referidos. Con este \u00faltimo negocio le ha ido muy bien y desea ampliarlo, porque cada d\u00eda crece su clientela. Esta es una de las razones por las cuales acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 una parte en carne, gallina, cerdo y pescado en mayor volumen y la otra parte la invertir\u00e1 en perfumes, cremas y productos de belleza, que llegaron en su catalogo con buenos descuentos, los cuales aprovechar\u00e1 para trasladarle los mejores precios a sus clientes. Su meta mas adelante en invertir en vitrinas, adecuar su espacio locativo, con el fin de ofrecer mejores precios, mejores productos y aumentar su clientela y con ello sus ingresos.  ","en":"Ruth is 43 years old and lives in the beautiful and historic city of Cartagena de Indias with her husband and 2 children (ages 10 and 12).  She has several businesses there, including one business in which she sells perfumes and general cosmetics, and another business where she sells chicken, pork, fish, and beef.  \r\n\r\nEver since Ruth was a little girl business has been her main calling in life.  Even though she admits it was a long time ago, she can still remember that in school she used to sell her classmates costume jewelry; she would bring hair bands, earrings, bracelets, and other items to school and then sell them to her classmates.  Ruth\u2019s goal was always to be independent and generate her own income, and so she continued with her business activities after she finished her studies.  She would ask potential customers what they needed and then would purchase those items and sell them; her customers would pay her in agreed-upon installments.  \r\n\r\nRuth\u2019s business currently helps support her family.  She sells products that she purchases from suppliers in the city center, along with items that she buys from special product catalogs.  She also takes orders for beef, chicken and pork from friends, family, neighbors, and referrals and sells the meat at her home.  Her meat business has gone very well and she wants to expand it, since her customer base grows by the day.  \r\n\r\nThat is one of the reasons why Ruth has decided to take out a Kiva loan.  This is her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and she will use some of it to purchase beef, chicken, pork, and fish in larger quantities.  She will use the rest of it to invest in perfume, creams, and other beauty products, which she will purchase with discounts from a catalog\u2014that way she can transfer the best prices to her customers.  \r\n\r\nRuth\u2019s plan for the future is to invest in display cases and adapt the retail space that she leases.  This will allow her to offer better prices and products and expand her clientele, and thus increase her income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1072271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase

He studied up to second grade in elementary school.  When his father died when he was only nine years old, his paternal grandfather taught him everything related to growing coffee.  As time went by and with his desire to make progress as a grower he acquired a few parcels and the other ones were inherited from his grandfather.  He\u2019s been a coffee grower for years and knows that in order for its production to increase he needs to reforest, fertilize and provide maintenance to his parcel by weeding it and pruning.

The monthly profit from sales of milk amounts to about 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Adabiyat requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows, which will help her to increase milk volumes.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued increase of domestic livestock headcount.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1612.5,"image":{"id":1081229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Progress village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-27T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-27T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adabiyat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-18T09:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25201.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329805,"comment":null},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":25201.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458641,"comment":null},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":25201.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013786,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T13:14:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":417352,"name":"Aquilino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el municipio de Achuapa departamento de le\u00f3n, El se\u00f1or Aquilino se ha caracterizado por ser una persona muy trabajadora debido a que ha sabido manejar las condiciones de su familia.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmmie hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband is the main technician while she handles finances, accounts, inventories, and promotion. They offer all types of repair and check-up services. Her shop is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are business owners in the local community. She earns a minimum of 5000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare generator parts needed for her business. She expects a boost in income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLydia hopes her business will grow and dreams of being able to give her children a high-quality education as a result of all of her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

","en":"Jamiykul is 57 years old and a widow, she has raised her son.  In 2000, in search of a source income for her family, Jamiykul started her own business selling clothing, starting with a sum of 10,000 somoni (KGS).  Thanks to her perseverance and hard work Jamiykul was able to grow her business to a monthly income of 6,000 somoni (KGS).

She worked for many years as a teacher at the Min-Bulak village school, and was awarded the title \"Teacher Emeritus\". In 1996, Aishake got involved in agriculture and animal husbandry as a means of acquiring more income for her family. Thanks to her hard work, her business, which began with 5,000 somi (KGS), now has one cow, two calves, one heifer, as well as ten hectares of irrigated land where she grows beans, perennial herbs, and potatoes.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Aishake has asked Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 60,000 somi (KGS) to buy bean seeds, fuel and lubricants. Aishake plans to invest the proceeds from the loan into further expanding her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1082009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase seeds and fuel","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Min-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-28T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-28T02:50:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aishake ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":30475.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071088,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":30475.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754662,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-29T04:32:53Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:23:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":419064,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon works hard to support her family.

She is the single mother of one son, who is already an adult.  She studied through the fifth grade and didn't continue due to financial difficulties.  She lives in her own home with her family and doesn't support anyone else.\r\n\r\nShe has had a business selling basic goods for more than ten years.  She sells at the local market and in her home.  With this work, she makes a monthly income of almost 7,000 meticals, which she puts towards her home's expenses.  She also saves some in her bank account and through Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nShe has had loans with other banks and paid them back without any problems.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client of the institution.  This is her third loan with Hluvuku, and it is for 20,000 meticals.  She will use it to buy products (rice, soap, flour, butter, beans, etc.) to increase her quantity of merchandise.  Her previous loans were for 20,000 meticals each, and they both went towards her business.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay back her loan on time.

Ludmila produces cheese and sells on average 30 kg of this product in the village. Along with the above-mentioned, the family owns 2.5 hectares of agricultural land. They grow tomatoes, onions and potatoes on the plot. Alexander sells harvested products locally to greengrocery products retailers. The total average monthly income of the family is 500 Laris. \r\n\r\nAlexander requested a loan to rent a tractor for tilling the land. In addition, he will purchase fertilizers and drugs for fertilizing the land and treating the plants for parasites.

He also saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nHe has had loans through other banks (BIM), and he paid them back without any problems.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client of the institution.  This is his third loan with Hluvuku, and it is for 10,000 meticals.  He will use it to buy chicks, feed, and vitamins to increase his production.

The family also has a greenhouse, where greens and tomatoes are grown. Harvested products are sold at the  market as well.  Average total monthly income of the family is 800 Laris, including the pensions of Irma\u2019s mother-in-law, sister-in-law and daughter.<p>\r\n\r\nIrma is requesting a loan to start a small poultry business.
