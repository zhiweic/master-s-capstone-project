Use her short hair, glasses and sporty shirt to spot her. She has been selling jewelery for 22 years. She orders and makes original jewelery from gold, silver, and surgical steel, as well as costume jewelery. She sells her products by catalog, and already has a fixed clientele in the city of Temuco. Her work schedule is flexible, but she does work every day of the week. Elizabeth purchases her merchandise from distributors and has a workshop she uses for the jewelery she sends to be made or repaired. She will use this loan to buy jewelery, rings, and weights for gold. One of her business goals is to buy a computer, which would make it possible to promote her products. Her most long-term goal is to establish a permanent location for her business.\r\n\r\nElizabeth lives with her husband and one of her dreams is for them to marry in the church, as they currently have only a civil marriage. She is motivated to continue with her business due to the economic independence and work schedule.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the support offered by Fondo Esperanza, as it has made it possible for her to invest in her business, learning new strategies for organizing expenses. On the other hand, she has also greatly enjoyed the company of the other entrepreneurs. The communal bank is an honest, respectful, and committed group.\r\n\r\nRecoleta is one of the 34 communes of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and is located in the north-central sector of the Santiago metropolitan region. Commerce there is active, especially in the commercial neighborhood of Patronato, which has hosted primarily Arabs (in the beginning) and Koreans

What she most enjoys about her work is harvesting her fruit as this is when she feels that the months of hard work are providing their reward, in the quality of her fruit.  She considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her products from the farm to the warehouse centers which are located in the town of Santa Rosa.  This is where they offer her the best price for her produce.  Right now, Blanca's main priority is caring for her cacao by weeding and fertilizing her crops so that she can enjoy better harvests.\r\n\r\nThis will be Blanca's eighth loan from MFP and she is happy to know that she will, once again, have financial support.

She\u2019s married to Valerio, 38, and they have their own house located in \r\nSanta Rosa. \r\n\r\nJesusa opened her own business, a grocery store, selling products in her parents\u2019 house and as time passed used her accumulated savings to buy her own lot where she currently has built her store.  She is a very hardworking woman who has had this activity for three years and she points out that one can reach one\u2019s goal based on lots of patience.  Today, she feels good about the activity she carries out and with the good income she earns.  In fact, she stocks almost everything her customers need and when you add the good customer service Jesusa provides this makes her store one of the most popular since there isn\u2019t any customer who wouldn\u2019t want to come by to purchase even the smallest crumb from her.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to continue making progress and providing good service to her consumers.  She needs to buy more groceries for her store and knows that she\u2019ll be able to accomplish this thanks to support from the lenders.  This will be MFP loan #5 and she is grateful to the lenders who provide this support so that she can stay in business.  She will use the 1000 new soles to buy groceries like: canned goods, assorted beverages (soft-drinks) and vegetables, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":946151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T18:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesusa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1011,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400836,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T11:52:17Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370912,"name":"Aida Yanina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora A\u00edda es socia del banco comunal Mujeres Triunfadoras, vive en un hermoso lugar de la ciudad de Cuenca, esta ciudad es la tercera de mayor importancia del pa\u00eds, por su actividad econ\u00f3mica, tiene una gran riqueza cultural, gastron\u00f3mica, su gente es amable y mantiene las tradiciones de sus padres.\n\nDo\u00f1a A\u00edda tiene 31 a\u00f1os, es casada y fruto de su uni\u00f3n conyugal ha concebido 3 hijos de 14, 12 y 2 a\u00f1os de edad, sus dos primeros hijos estudian en un colegio de la ciudad.

The two men and ten women members of the 5 de Diciembre communal bank meet in Portoviejo every two weeks.  The members carry out a number of different business activities like general commerce, services, and others.  They joined their efforts to be able to access the benefits that the Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir lends. This is the first cycle of their communal bank.  They hope to complete it very well in order to get ahead in the institution.\r\n\r\nThis is the place where we meet Nevi, age 33.  She is in a common-law-marriage and has three children; ages 11, 9, and 7.  The children all go to school.  Her husband is a bricklayer.  In addition to being a great housewife, she sells Avon products (perfume, creams, jewelry, and women\u2019s accessories) in order to earn something on her own.\r\n\r\nShe sells door to door, and she goes to work every day.  However, she only works in the mornings because it is much cooler then and her children are in school.  In the afternoons she has to help her little ones with their homework.  She leaves her products on credit, and she collects payments weekly.

is Emerita, 57, resident of Bacoor, Cavite City, Philippines. Her husband is Rizalino, a carpenter, and she is a mother to her two children. She manages their household, together with her husband, while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmerita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmerita hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a loan of PHP 13,000, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Ann hopes that her business will grow in the coming years, and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":946500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to sell, and to do maintenance on her sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-18T13:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":866.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3467,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3533.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738885,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3466,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3532.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146111,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3467.04,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3533.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275282,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2599.96,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2649.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997828,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-18T14:25:33Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371074,"name":"Laon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Laon is 40-year-old married woman with five children, four of whom are in school.

is Rita, 32, resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. The variety store is the place to go to buy one small container of shampoo, five PHP-worth of cooking oil, or a single egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling items individually. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRita hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams that, through all her hard work on her business, she will be able to give her children a high-quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week, where she can share stories of her work and also draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":946510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" to buy stock for her variety store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T21:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738886,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2355.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146112,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2132.96,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275284,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600.04,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997829,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T22:43:24Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371083,"name":"Jimmy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jimmy is a simple farmer with a simple dream in life--to have a happy family.

She is 42 years old and a resident of Tanza, Cavite City in the Philippines.  She is married and the mother of three children.  Her husband, Joey, is her business partner. Together, she and her husband manage the household while operating the business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to meet her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nPaz operates a junk shop.  Trash is not formally sorted in the Philippines and, while waiting for local dump trucks to collect the garbage, people scavenge trash bags and garbage dumps for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic and paper, which they sell to junk shops like Paz\u2019s for a profit.  The junk shops then stack, clean and gather large quantities of these materials to sell to foundries, factories and others in need of these materials.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 22,000 PHP. She will augment her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors with the funds from the loan.  She expects an increase in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPaz hopes her business grows more in the coming years.  She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members both to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and\/or clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":946516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for scrap materials to sell in her junk shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T21:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1466.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4400.01,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4416.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738887,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":7332.99,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7359.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146113,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5867.04,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5888.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275286,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4399.96,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4415.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997830,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T22:43:24Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:47:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371091,"name":"Chritine's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chritine's group is comprised of five hard-working women. Chritine is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kamwenge in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past year, Chritine has been working hard to manage her small hotel, which sells soft drinks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Chritine has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more drinks to sell and will help Chritine generate greater profits, which she will use to pay her child\u2019s school fees.  Chritine hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nChritine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is Jocelyn, 49, resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Ereneo, her business partner, and they have two children. She and her husband manage their own household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJocelyn operates a buy-and-sell business. Basically, what she does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it for a little profit. Her products are RTW (ready to wear) clothes, personal accessories, and other similar products. She attracts customers with low prices and many options. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy RTW products and other items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJocelyn hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years.

Majdi is photographed next to his current rickshaw.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi borrowers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":946650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to replace her old sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2011-12-27T18:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koustan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257277474,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418445,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133354,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276750205,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243695,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287367318,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294647374,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495538,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308261172,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490893,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-28T02:02:08Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T15:19:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371174,"name":"Tawananyasha Dzamwari Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 46-year-old Lydia from Machipisa, Harare.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary, which is the only source of income for the family. Najah wants to make some repairs to her old house such as painting, changing tiles, changing windows and doors, etc. in order to offer her family better home living conditions. She is taking out a loan from Kiva's partner, FATEN, to help her pay for those expenses. When Najah gets the loan, she will be able to make the necessary repairs to her house, and these will enable her to live with her family in a better and healthier environment. \n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her sons help him by selling the milk to the community clients and her daughters support him by taking care of his buffaloes. \r\n\r\nIrshaad has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for the further expansion of her husband's business. With the loan, he will buy another buffalo to increase the milk productivity. This will allow Irshaad's husband to sell milk in larger quantities and to make more profits. \r\n\r\nIrshaad is hopeful that an investment will be more productive for her husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":946663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy another buffalo for dairy business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2012-01-01T08:01:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irshaad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257119527,"comment":null},{"amount":41.07,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263244543,"comment":null},{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269969502,"comment":null},{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276576747,"comment":null},{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T10:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283066768,"comment":null},{"amount":41.07,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287368684,"comment":null},{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294279956,"comment":null},{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301333225,"comment":null},{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308089509,"comment":null},{"amount":41.07,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315323617,"comment":null},{"amount":39.37,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3528.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322932242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-05T03:57:32Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T11:52:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371190,"name":"Ay\u00e9l\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ay\u00e9l\u00e9 est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 36 ans.

He wants to use his loan money to purchase a small computer to speed up his transactions and to employ two people in his shop so that he can serve his customers faster. He also wishes to use the money to increase his working capital. \n\nAccess to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, 80% of the population, do not have bank accounts. As most Zambians live in rural areas, distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Mobile Transactions Zambia Limited (MTZL) is an early stage company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction services by propagating an open network using small businesses called Champion Agents. Bright is one of the champion Agents. This is his story. \n\nWhen Bright first started his business his main focus was to get people in his community to know about the service that he provides. He started off by doing direct sales to customers in his community by distributing flyers and explaining his business to them in person. His strategy paid off because barely a month later his transactions had increased from a mere 10 transactions a day to 48 transactions a day. Because of the quick growth of his business he faces the challenge of working float (electronic and cash value of his working capital) which means he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers from time to time. He frequently has to close his shop and make trips to the bank to convert his electronic money to cash and vice versa. \n\nBright is currently living with his grandmother who is taking care of five other people. He continues to work extra hard so that he can be able to move out of his grandmother's house and get his own place. In the next five years, Bright sees himself as a full blown businessman. He plans to open money transfer shops in two new locations. \n\nIn Bright's video, the interview is conducted by a representative of Mobile Transactions."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":945547,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2516,"youtubeId":"oqOX6ulgRn8","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Bright from  Zambia","thumbnailImageId":945547},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase a small computer to speed up his transactions and to employ two people in his shop so that he can be able to serve his customers faster","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Ndola","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bright","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371197,"name":"Soake","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Soake est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 47 ans.

In search of sources of income for this family, Chyngyz started his animal husbandry and farming business in 2007.  Thanks to his tenacity and persistence, his business now has 30 heads of sheep and 6 heads of cattle, yielding about 9,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of dairy and meat products.  He also works on one hectare of land, where he grows beans and multi-year herbs.  Chyngyz also provides tractor driving services for field work during the season.  In order to further increase his livestock headcount, he requested a loan in the sum of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase livestock.

In search of income sources for his family, he started his own animal husbandry and farming business in 2002.  He grows potatoes, corn and wheat on three hectares of arable land, and also has three heads of cattle and five sheep.  Thanks to Sarybay's tenacity and persistence, his business yields from 5,000 to 25,000 som (KGS) per season today.  He also provides a taxi service during the off-season.  In order to further expand his business, Sarybay requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase wheat and potato seeds, treat land and purchase mineral fertilizers.  He plans to invest the profit from this loan into building a more comfortable and spacious barn and building a fence.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":946710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyrgyz-Ata village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T23:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarybay","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50103.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070926,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T02:04:02Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371220,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David lives in Khoni, West Georgia, with his family--which includes his wife, Keso, his 24-year-old son, and his daughter-in-law.
