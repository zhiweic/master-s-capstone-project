Ahora ya tiene 52 a\u00f1os, es divorciada, situaci\u00f3n que le caus\u00f3 mucho temor en su vida, pero sigui\u00f3 con su vida y ahora vive en el cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. \nMorayma conoce de agricultura desde que es una ni\u00f1a pero emprendi\u00f3 con esta actividad desde hace 30 a\u00f1os, poco despu\u00e9s de haber terminado la secundaria. Invierte todo su d\u00eda en el cuidado de los cultivos y la venta de los mismos. La dificultad que ha tenido con el crecimiento de su negocio es la falta de capital, sin embargo ha encontrado en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa mucha agilidad y preocupaci\u00f3n por la gente de las zonas rurales. Es por esto que decidi\u00f3 solicitar all\u00ed un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar insumos y herramientas que le ayuden a mantener su finca en un estado \u00f3ptimo, de tal forma que los cultivos no se echen a perder, pues en varias ocasiones la falta de atenci\u00f3n a los sembr\u00edos, al suelo, a las cercas y dem\u00e1s, ha ocasionado que cantidades grandes de frutas se desechen. Ella espera que con este mantenimiento mejorado que le dar\u00e1 a la finca su producto se genere en mayores cantidades y as\u00ed poder tener m\u00e1s ingresos de los cuales pueda destinar una cantidad para ahorrar y solventar gastos en sus a\u00f1os de vejez, en los cuales se teme estar\u00e1 sola con el  \u00fanico sustento de su trabajo. Morayma env\u00eda un saludo y mucha gratitud a quienes aportan con sus pr\u00e9stamos en el portal de Kiva  para apoyar los sue\u00f1os de tantas personas en Latinoam\u00e9rica y el mundo que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio. ","en":"Morayma is a woman who has overcome several obstacles throughout her life. She began to work on her parents' farm when she was very young, plowing the land and harvesting the fruits of the cultivated seeds. Now she is 52 years old and divorced, a situation which caused her to have fear in her life. However, she continued on and she now lives in the canton of Santo Domingo in the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. \r\n\r\nSanto Domingo connects the Sierra region with the coastal region of Ecuador. The city has become a hub of commerce, with many sectors experiencing growth. As a testament to this, many enterprising families who started their small business a few years ago are now small business owners who give employment to the next generation. Studies reveal that the majority of businesses began empirically and have been embraced by tourists, entrepreneurs and travelers who go from one region to another. It is also the third most inhabited city in the country.\r\n\r\nMorayma has had knowledge of agriculture since she was a girl, but she started her own business thirty years ago, a short time after finishing secondary school. She invests her entire day in the maintenance and sale of her crops. The difficulty she has had with growing her business is a lack of capital. However, through Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa she has found plenty of flexibility and concern for those who live in rural areas. This is why she decided to apply for a loan through the organization in order to buy supplies and tools which will help her maintain her farm in excellent conditions. This will keep her from losing crops, because on several occasions a lack of attention to the fields, the ground, the fences, and other elements has caused large quantities of fruit to be thrown away. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that with the improved maintenance that she will give to her land, her product will generate larger quantities and she will be able to have a better income. She will then be able to save a certain amount to settle her costs in her elderly years, when she is afraid that she will be alone with only the support from her work. \r\n\r\nMorayma sends her greetings and gratitude to the Kiva lenders, who support the dreams of so many people in Latin America and in the world who have set off with their business ideas.

","en":"Safar is 42 years old and is married with four children.  He is a very kind and hard-working man.  His wife and children are most important to him and he does everything he can so his family has everything they need.  Safar is involved in raising livestock.  Since he lives in a rural village, this line of work is very much in demand.  He started working in livestock 16 years ago.  He has a dairy cow which gives 10-12 liters of milk a day.  Safar's wife does the milking and she makes dairy products, which she sells to her neighbors and acquaintances.  She helps her husband in this way.

She works as a teacher in a school. As a means of supplementing her income, in 2005 she started a business in animal husbandry with just 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Thanks to her persistent hard work, her farm now brings in a monthly income of around 5,000 Som from the sale of dairy products. For the purpose of further developing her business, Nargilya has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 20,000 Som to buy livestock to fatten and re-sell. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to invest in the expansion of her business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.25,"image":{"id":1299340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase 5 sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-02-23T16:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-25T16:20:07Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nargilya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5065.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426819,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-23T19:40:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530442,"name":"Julius","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julius is a 37 year-old man who has two children and lives in Fort Portal Uganda.

Since 2000, she has been working in animal husbandry, having started this business with only 10,000 Som. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now includes 4 bulls and 2 cows. In addition, she works a 0.5 hectare plot of land each year. Her monthly income from her business is approximately 15,000 Som. For the purpose of further developing her business, Baktygul has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som to buy 4 cows so she can increase her earnings from the sale of milk. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to invest in the future expansion of her herd.

is a 38 year-old mother of two children.

Emilia would like to spend the loan on more goods, i.e,. instant noodles, sugar, rice, coffee, milk, shampoo, bath soap, etc.  In addition, she also wants to buy building materials, i.e,. zinc, cement, sand, etc. to enlarge her kiosk building.

While searching for additional sources of income for her family in 2005, Elmira started her own animal husbandry business. Her initial investment was 20,000 som. Successful work in animal husbandry and the sale of diary products has allowed Elmira to grow fodder on a 1.16 hectare plot. This enables her to feed her own cattle as well as to earn extra money selling fodder. \r\n\r\nWith future business development in mind, Elmira turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a 30,000 som loan to purchase a dairy cow in order to increase her income from milk sales. Elmira plans to renovate her home with the additional income.

He has a partially-completed education as a technologist in light industry, and has rich experience in this field. For the last 3 years, he has been working as the lead specialist in a tailor studio. Having gained a lot of practical experience and a regular clientele, he decided to open his own tailor studio. To start his business, he rented premises and set up the equipment that he had acquired during the time he worked in the first tailor studio. Yaroslav has proven himself to be a well-mannered and positive person. Before he established his own business, he successfully completed courses in the company \"Senti\" that provides educational classes. In order to provide full service for his clients, Yaroslav needs to buy a buttonhole machine. When he heard about Kiva's advantageous program \"Start Up,\" he approached the Microfinance Bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS) to buy one. An analysis of Yaroslav's business plan indicates that he can earn around 20,000 Som per month. He plans to use the income generated by this loan to re-invest in his business and expand it by purchasing one more machine. He is very happy that such a microfinance program exists and is grateful to all sponsors from Kiva and Bai Tushum & Partners.

Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas. En la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde vive Betty, una mujer de 31 a\u00f1os de edad que fue madre desde muy joven y que decidi\u00f3 vivir con su pareja sin llevar a cabo el contrato de matrimonio, convivencia de la cual nacieron 4 hijos que ahora viven con Betty, ya que ella y su pareja decidieron independizar sus vida y se separaron. Betty tiene aprobada la escuela primaria y trabaja muy duro para que a sus hijos, que estudian actualmente en una escuela fiscal, no les falte nada y puedan un d\u00eda obtener el t\u00edtulo profesional que ella no pudo alcanzar por su falta de recursos.\nBetty no ha limitado su labor a pesar de las barreras que su falta de preparaci\u00f3n le ha puesto en el camino. A ra\u00edz de su separaci\u00f3n, ella es la principal proveedora de sustento en su hogar, es por eso que hace 3 a\u00f1os, con algunos ahorros, instal\u00f3 un local de venta de v\u00edveres y frutas el cual atiende desde que sale el sol hasta la noche, completando hasta 14 horas de trabajo, pero su responsabilidad en el hogar es constante, paralelamente a la atenci\u00f3n de su tienda, ella se las arregla para tener su casa limpia, atender y ayudar a sus hijos y proveerles el alimento diario.

","en":"Each province of Ecuador passes down stories of the men and women who left footprints, forming the future of those who will arrive later. And so, several Ecuadorian cultures lived in the parish of R\u00edo Verde, a historical area of Santo Domingo, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a province of Ecuador that in recent years has had a sustained high growth. Its capital is a city with the most attractive, appealing and delicious fruit and gastronomy offered there. It also has considerable trade and has become a land port of trade between the mountain ranges and the coastal regions. It also has many tourist attractions accompanied by a warm climate which is frequented by both national and international tourists. It is for this reason that most of its inhabitants have embarked on some commercial activity or service for residents and tourists. \r\n\r\nBetty lives in the parish of R\u00edo Verde. She is a 31 year old woman who became a mother at a very young age and decided to live with her partner without a marriage license, and they had four children who now live with Betty, as she and her partner decided to separate and become independent of one another. Betty has a primary school certificate and works very hard for her children who currently attend a public school. They do not require anything and they can one day receive a professional title that she could not because of the absence of resources. Betty has not been limited in her work because of her lack of preparation by the obstacles placed on her path.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of her separation, she is the main provider for household expenses. This is why three years ago, with some savings, she opened a grocery and fruit stand and attends to it from sunrise until sunset, working 14 hours a day. But her household responsibilities are constant and at the same time that she tends to her store she also cleans the house and takes care of the children providing them with their daily bread.\r\n\r\nHer experience has taught her that it is important to always have a selection of products in sufficient quantity, otherwise customers will search for other alternatives, and this is why Betty is asking for a loan in order to buy products to meet the demand of her clients and to attract more people to shop at her store, fitting it out attractively and comfortably for her and the people who come to her place. Thanks to your help, Betty will be able to give her children a quality life without passing up necessities and furthermore Betty will grow personally and professionally."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1299737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy supplies and make repairs for the growth of her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-02-23T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-25T18:00:06Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty Seneida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1570.5,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":131.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":147.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":151.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":156.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":159.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":162.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":169.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":172.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":132.23,"local_amount":131.85,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":132.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494988,"comment":null},{"amount":147.86,"local_amount":147.44,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":147.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524918,"comment":null},{"amount":151.6,"local_amount":151.17,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":151.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133222,"comment":null},{"amount":153.77,"local_amount":153.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":153.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313760,"comment":null},{"amount":157.43,"local_amount":156.98,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":157.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565367,"comment":null},{"amount":159.91,"local_amount":159.45,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":159.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814407,"comment":null},{"amount":672.2,"local_amount":670.28,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":672.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320583,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-03T10:42:06Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530490,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam, age 34, owns and operates a clothing sales business.

Zokir has a very difficult life, but he doesn't give up and he is trying to develop his business.  He knows that if he loses heart, his family will not survive.  So, Zokir tries to keep moving forward and to never despair.  \r\n\r\nOnce every two weeks, Zokir takes his cattle to the market where he sells them and he immediately buys calves.  Right now, he has 10 head of cattle.  He is planning to increase the size of his herd, but he does not have sufficient financial means to do so.  Because of this, Zokir applied to MDO Arvand for financial support.  \r\n\r\nZokir wants to use his loan to buy one more calf, which he will raise and fatten for sale at an advantageous price this spring.

old man and he lives in a rural area.  He is married and has two children.  His wife takes care of the children full time.  Jamshed doesn't have a higher education because there was never a possibility for him to study.  He earns his living selling coal and he's been in business for 10 years.  He started his business with ten bags of coal, but now he buys it up by the ton.  There is a strong demand for coal right now because it's winter and many people heat their homes with it.  This is his family's only source of income.\r\n\r\nSince he never had the chance, Jamshed's dream is that his children will get higher educations and will work, not selling coal, but in respectable professions.  Jamshed works day and night to make his dream a reality.  \r\n\r\nJamshed is taking out this loan to buy coal so he can increase his sales.

Of course her parents help her, but this doesn't make up for not having a man's shoulder to lean on. From an early age, Masturajon loved to sew and embroider. When she grew up, she completed dressmaking courses, and she is now a professional seamstress and has a lot of clients. She buys fabric at a wholesale market then sews national traditional dresses, embroiders them with various designs, then sells them to her clients. She is very skilled at sewing and this ability allows her to earn a living. Masturajon has approached Arvand for a loan to buy furniture and a fridge. She wants to furnish her apartment with the necessities.

She is currently single but has two young children, aged two and eight years old.  She lives with them at her parents' house.  Liz makes a living selling catalog beauty products, such as cosmetics and perfumes.  She sells them to friends, relatives and other people that she knows.  A lot of the time people pay in cash, while others pay in installments.  She has good results in this work and also has a good customer base.

woman. She is married and has 3 children. Her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation, and she has been working in food sales for the past 2 years. The money that her husband sends home is not sufficient to provide for the family, so Bunafsha tries to make it through the hard times on her own. She travels to the city to stock up on inventory herself, and her eldest son helps her out with the business even though he is only 12 years old. Her dream is for her children to grow up without wanting for anything. This year she wants to use her savings to carry out major renovations to her apartment, but the money she has put by will not be enough to cover such expenses, which is why she wants to increase her turnover and expand her business. Bunafsha will use the loan she receives from Arvand to purchase a wide variety of groceries to sell. She hopes to save up enough money so that in 6 months' time she can begin renovating her apartment.

His loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Tamaz will purchase materials to construct greenhouse on the family-owned land (iron pillars and polyethylene). He will grow different kinds of vegetables throughout the whole year. They will sell the harvested products on the local open market. The income of the family will significantly increase.

He put heating in all his greenhouses, installed  a large boiler, and this allowed him to increase his income. Thanks to these earnings, he was able to pay for his daughter's medical care. She had a curvature of the spine for which she was hospitalised and underwent massage therapy. Now her situation has markedly improved. This time, Stanislav is seeking a loan of 23,000 Ukrainian Hryvnya to buy fertilizer, coal, and plastic covering for his greenhouses for the new season. He hopes that buying coal and properly insulating his greenhouses will allow him to get an earlier harvest that he can sell quickly. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1299677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer, coal, and plastic covering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-02-23T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-25T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stanislav","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":11500},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":11500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":619.57,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5042.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372947069,"comment":null},{"amount":805.43,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6554.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726623,"comment":null},{"amount":1425,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-25T08:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":11596.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589758,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T17:09:34Z","paid_date":"2013-08-25T08:38:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530452,"name":"Mwanarusi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanarusi is grateful for her previous loan, which has helped expand her business and ensure that she gains her share from the market.

is 19 years old and lives in the town of Pallisa in the Iganga region of Uganda.

For the past 5 years, Loy has been working hard to manage her bar, which sells local drinks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Loy has requested a loan of 300000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock more millet that will be used to make the local brew for selling, and will help Loy to generate greater profits and be in the position to provide for herself. Loy hopes that in the future she will be able to own a plot of land. \r\n\r\nLoy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Sadly, Abilio's wife died recently, and since then he has dedicated himself to providing for his family.  Abilio started working at an early age so that he could help his parents, as he has many siblings; therefore, he couldn't finish high school or study a profession, though he would have liked to have done so.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative and with dedication, Abilio works in the fields for a city agriculture fund.

He grows beans and corn for a living and he also grows loroco to supplement the household expenses.  He has been in farming for many years and he is proud because he has been able to gain a lot of experience, which allows him to improve his harvests day by day.  He owns the land he plants on and it is located in a very agricultural area.  He gets all of his family's help; they help him sell in all the neighboring areas and he has a big clientele because people prefer him for the quality of his produce, his good prices, and his good service.  Hugo is an enterprising man who is dedicated to his work.  He is constantly looking to better himself and succeed.

She thinks it is going well because of her good performance and the kind treatment she gives the others.\r\n\r\nJoselyn is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, and thanks to the provided help she will be able to do the renovation to one of the kitchen walls, as it is deteriorated by moisture and potassium nitrate that is inside. In this way she can give greater security and wellbeing to her family, and thus she will continue working and striving to achieve her big dream of becoming a successful professional so she can get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1300398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to pay for renovation of the kitchen walls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-23T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-25T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joselyn Yesenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":76.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":78.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":82.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":85.06},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":89.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":92.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.91,"local_amount":76.13,"processed_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":77.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776459,"comment":null},{"amount":30.78,"local_amount":78.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":79.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483285,"comment":null},{"amount":32.36,"local_amount":82.37,"processed_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":83.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889324,"comment":null},{"amount":33.41,"local_amount":85.06,"processed_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":86.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664227,"comment":null},{"amount":35.02,"local_amount":89.14,"processed_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":90.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775481,"comment":null},{"amount":113.52,"local_amount":288.95,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":293.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778966,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-24T04:10:12Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530536,"name":"Ashan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ashan is 42 years old and from Tiribe, Kenya.

He is a committed man and he does not doubt that he will be able to make the changes in the expected time frame and with the success desired. He needs to invest, but he does not have sufficient capital. That is why he is asking for a loan from Integral that will allow him to buy cement, bricks, flooring, tools, etc. Santos Rafael has good payment references and he takes responsibility for paying back the loan. He is grateful for the help, and at the same time he hopes that he will be able to give his family a better quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":149.18,"image":{"id":1300399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy cement, bricks, flooring, and tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-02-23T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-25T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Rafael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":140.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":171.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":190.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":208.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":149.18,"local_amount":149.18,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":149.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399735566,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T04:48:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531158,"name":"Sagrada Familia Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 Sagrada Familia trabaja con la fundaci\u00f3n desde el a\u00f1o 2.006, est\u00e1 integrado por 17 mujeres que realizan distintas actividades para poder ayudar a sus familias y por medio de ese trabajo ir creciendo no solo como persona, sino tambi\u00e9n como microempresarias.

She is pictured with her group -- 17 One Acre Fund farmers, 15 women and 2 men. Phelesia is standing on the right, with her hand raised. She is receiving an input loan for \u00bd acre of maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation. Phelesia joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. Phelesia joined One Acre Fund so that she could grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nPhelesia reports that before One Acre Fund, she was able to grow about two bags of maize per \u00bd acre, but with her One Acre Fund input loan during Long Rains 2012, she harvested six bags per 1\/2 acre!

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.

She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy chickens for her shop. In the future, Surja Maya plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. In Nepal, the meat is always fresh.

In the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":101.3,"image":{"id":1299844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buys grocery goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Tangal","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:03Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chandrawati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-01T09:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913277,"comment":null},{"amount":10.41,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-29T08:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364624254,"comment":null},{"amount":10.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-29T09:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020254,"comment":null},{"amount":10.35,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.07,"payment_id":381808083,"comment":null},{"amount":10.1,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":390668146,"comment":null},{"amount":9.81,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":400621662,"comment":null},{"amount":9.98,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":410196545,"comment":null},{"amount":9.75,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"payment_id":419959994,"comment":null},{"amount":9.98,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":429613887,"comment":null},{"amount":10.08,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"payment_id":439840349,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-24T08:06:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530788,"name":"Dulam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Dulam is 48 years old.

He is married and has a son who is just one year old.  Gino lives alongside his wife and siblings in his parents' house.  He makes a living editing audio and video tracks for television and radio programs that are well-known in the region.  In addition he rents out his sound and some other equipment for festivals and social events in the city.  Part of his work consists of making adverts, photo shoots, narrating documentaries, and such like.  He does this work at his mother's house as there he has a small office.  He has had this business for three years and feels it is going well as the number of customers has multiplied.  What Gino likes about his work is that he is making a good income and that he has fun doing it - this type of work is something that has fascinated him since he was a boy.  In the time that he has been doing this work, Gino has learned many things and he is continually training himself to use new sound and design technology.  His main goal is to have a fully equipped recording studio.  In the meantime he is buying some of the tools that he needs for his work, little by little.  On this occasion he is applying for a loan of 1500 Nuevo Soles.  With this money he will buy new cables that he needs to update, he will repair a speaker and buy coloured light bulbs that he needs for renting out."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1300675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy cables and repair music equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T08:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T08:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":230.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":237.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":246.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":248},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":264.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":272.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.34,"local_amount":230.85,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-20T08:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":238.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123137,"comment":null},{"amount":94.97,"local_amount":237.43,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":245.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868987,"comment":null},{"amount":98.51,"local_amount":246.28,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":254.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577827,"comment":null},{"amount":99.2,"local_amount":248,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":256.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530058,"comment":null},{"amount":105.89,"local_amount":264.72,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":273.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975089,"comment":null},{"amount":109.09,"local_amount":272.72,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":281.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996358,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-25T00:02:19Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530789,"name":"Conchita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Conchita is 61 years old and married with seven children.

She is married and has two young children.  She lives alongside them in her in-laws' house.  Jessica makes a living selling food.  She starts very early as every day she goes to the market to buy the necessary ingredients to make the most delicious dishes.  She prepares all the stews throughout the day and starts serving customers at 5pm.  She finishes late at night.  She works alone and has been doing this for three years.  Jessica likes her work because she can spend time with her children and give them the necessary attention.  They are still young and need her to look after them.  In the time that she has been working, Jessica has learned always to give her customers a smile and good service as this is what makes them return to her and so she keeps customers.  She hopes to continue with this work and expand with more chairs and seats, and even look for larger premises.

Her favorite part of the KOMAZA microforestry program is \"seeing from my neighbors that the trees are doing well and learning how to plant trees.\" Also pictured with the group of three is Kuvuna, who is a cosigner for Nyevu's tree farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1297513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase tree farm inputs such as eucalyptus seedlings and fertilizer, as well as to pay for technical training and maintenance support","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mavueni","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":282,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwanajuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyevu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":122,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2023-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2023-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429543145,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-25T10:46:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531252,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes, de 63 a\u00f1os,est\u00e1 casada y vive junto a su esposo y a su \u00faltimo hijo en la casa que construyeron hace muchos a\u00f1os como producto de su trabajo .

age 36, and his wife Felicia have been tending to a two-acre cacao farm for ten years now. They have brought up three children, two of which are currently in school. The kids and wife help Pablo out on the farm during peak harvest season, which for cacao picks up in January to May. To harvest cacao, farmers use a hook knife or machete to cut the fruit off the trunk. Once the pod is cracked open the sweet pulp surrounding cacao beans starts fermenting and needs to be put into wooden boxes for fermentation. \n\nPablo was inspired to start farming cacao because of the stable market access and an attractive price. He saw it as an opportunity because cacao is a permanent crop and will start producing pods after about four years and continue for decades thereafter. Apart from cacao, the family also plants corn and beans for home use.\n\nThe favorite part of cacao farming for Pablo is harvesting because it does not require a lot of work. The challenging part, however, is cleaning because it requires a lot of time, and besides farming Pablo also works in a shrimp farm. \n\nThe family is requesting the loan to hire five men for ten days to clean their cacao farm. Cleaning is the process of clearing the underbrush in the cacao field and its surroundings to clear access for pruning, harvesting or planting alongside them. Because of ample growth in the lush tropical lowlands of Belize, cleaning is an especially strenuous activity that needs to be repeated every three months. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":212.69,"image":{"id":1300587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean two acres of cacao","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971175,"comment":null},{"amount":52.64,"local_amount":95.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":103.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751700,"comment":null},{"amount":26.52,"local_amount":48.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993441,"comment":null},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":48.46,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255610,"comment":null},{"amount":23.01,"local_amount":41.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":45.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136450,"comment":null},{"amount":30.7,"local_amount":55.81,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":60.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900667,"comment":null},{"amount":27.05,"local_amount":49.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":53.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088548,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-24T15:12:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531253,"name":"Doris","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Doris, de 46 a\u00f1os, es una mujer amable y trabajadora, es madre de dos hijas a quienes cri\u00f3 y educ\u00f3 sola ya que desde hace varios a\u00f1os se encuentra divorciada, ella vive en su casa propia y trabaja mucho pues desea brindarles una mejor calidad de vida a su familia.El trabajo de Doris consiste en la venta de ropas usadas.

She is the mother of two children who she has raised and educated alone as she has been divorced for some time. She lives in her own home and works a lot as she wants to offer her children a better quality of life. Doris works selling used second hand clothes. Her work begins with buying articles of clothing from various people or in the city market, selecting those that are in the best condition. Later, she divides these into women's clothes and men's clothes, and, finally, she separates the children's clothes from the adult's clothes. \r\nOnce a month, she travels with a friend to the villages and population centers to sell her merchandise. She has been running this business for 13 years and it is doing very well. In addition, she has a small grocery store where she sells fruits, drinks, and candies to her neighbors from the place where she looks after her children. She likes her work because she can travel to different places. She thinks that the most difficult thing is that she has to go out very early in the morning and it can be dangerous at that time. She remembers that she began this business because of the low income her household had. But, once she started selling used clothes, things improved a lot. Now, she also sometimes sells new clothes that she buys from another city and she hopes to continue with this new line in order to improve her profits. At this time, she is requesting $775. She is grateful to all the people who have made this loan possible as she feels secure in growing her business. She will used the requested funds to buy more clothes so she can continue her business selling clothes to the distant towns of her region. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1300691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy second hand clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":307.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":316.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":328.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":330.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":352.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":365.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":119.17,"local_amount":307.54,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-20T08:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":307.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123141,"comment":null},{"amount":122.56,"local_amount":316.29,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":316.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868991,"comment":null},{"amount":127.14,"local_amount":328.09,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577831,"comment":null},{"amount":128.02,"local_amount":330.37,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":330.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530062,"comment":null},{"amount":136.65,"local_amount":352.65,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":352.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975093,"comment":null},{"amount":141.46,"local_amount":365.06,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":365.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996362,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-27T21:20:39Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530834,"name":"Dzidza's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dzidza is a forty-year-old mother of seven children.

is a 43-year-old woman and is married to Marthen, a 56 years old man. They are blessed with 2 children Ari, 18, who attends the 3rd grade of senior high school and Sisca, 8, who attends the 2nd grade of elementary school. Even though Sarlintje\u2019s husband has a permanent job, the income does not fully cover all the living expenses including the children\u2019s school fees. This is the reason why Sarlintje started a kiosk business several years ago. Sarlintje is grateful because the business is running well and she has quite good customers.\r\n\r\nLately, Sarlintje has been thinking of renovating her kiosk building as well as adding more goods. To implement her dream, Sarlintje requested a loan from TLM of IDR 10,000,000. This loan will help her to provide building materials and also kiosk stocks such as sugar, coffee, snacks, soft drinks, shampoo, bath soap, detergent, instant noodles etc. Sarlintje is hoping that her dream to improve her business will come true.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1299929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

He was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.  He answered he learned that they are short term loans.\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit your family Leonard replied that he will get income to be able to educate and feed my children.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Leonard owns the following a cow, poultry, and bicycle but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

All his effort is currently focused on one son who is in college; one of his dreams is to see his son become a professional. \r\n\r\nHis customers are foreigners, people from other departments in the country such as San Juan del Sur, and loyal locals. He is applying for a loan to buy bougainvilla, clavellinas, multi-flowers, water lilies, cactus, hydrangea, palms, robeliana, coludos, monkey-puzzle trees, and organic fertilizer. The investment will allow him to stock a variety of plants so that his customers will visit more often.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":439.3,"image":{"id":1299008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy bougainvilla, clavellinas, multi-flowers, water lilies, cactus, hydrangea, palms, robeliana, coludos, monkey-puzzle trees, and organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Ad\u00e1n ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":840.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":892.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":944.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":968.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1020.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1039.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1103.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1147.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1186.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1240.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1286.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1329.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.55,"local_amount":840.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":868.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356474070,"comment":null},{"amount":37.76,"local_amount":892.4,"processed_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":922.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364494060,"comment":null},{"amount":39.95,"local_amount":944.31,"processed_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":975.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115355,"comment":null},{"amount":40.97,"local_amount":968.32,"processed_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1000.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675016,"comment":null},{"amount":43.18,"local_amount":1020.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1054.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539295,"comment":null},{"amount":43.98,"local_amount":1039.42,"processed_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1074.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788534,"comment":null},{"amount":46.68,"local_amount":1103.22,"processed_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1140.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410064868,"comment":null},{"amount":48.54,"local_amount":1147.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1185.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419828756,"comment":null},{"amount":50.2,"local_amount":1186.52,"processed_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1226.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430384546,"comment":null},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":1240.71,"processed_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1282.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978307,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-26T05:27:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530863,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David, age 23, operates a motorcycle, providing transportation services.

is a 61-year-old widow. She lives alone in Marneuli district. The only income for Guljamal is her pension, which is a very small amount. She has nobody to look after her. Guljamal has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for her business start-up without any success. Her loan requests have been rejected all the time because of her low income and poor living conditions. According to Credo estimations, she belongs in the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nGuljamal requested a loan to start up her own business, which is opening a tea room. Guljamal has already bought all the needed equipment and now she needs a loan to buy raw materials.

Animals on the farm have been given the names of \"Maua.\"\r\n\r\nPaul was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, and he answered, \"Because it finances and gives loans to farmers at a lower interest rate as compared to other MFIs, which do not deal with asset financing.\" He learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session that the loans offered \"are short term loans for small scale farming and businesses.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked \"How will this loan benefit your family?\", Paul replied, \"Money from the sale of milk will help supplement my other income so that I can pay school fees for my children.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Paul stated that he owns \"cow, poultry, bicycle\" but does not own \"pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile.\" Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household \"mosquito net, electricity, TV, DVD\" but does not have \"solar power, running water, sewing machine.\"\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

is 46-year-old married man. He lives in Khelvachauri district with his 41-year-old wife and two children. Bagrat works as a cleaner and his wife works as a cook, so they earn a small amount of monthly salary. The family owns a plot of agricultural land where they grow citrus and vegetables. The harvested products are sold at the local market.  \r\n\r\nBagrat is a very hard-working man, and he has been in this business for 21 years. He requested loans from local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, without any success. His loan requests were rejected because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nBagrat's current loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides start-up and restart-up credit with soft conditions to the rural poor, who are considered \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d and often do not have access to credit products because of their low income. Bagrat has requested a loan to buy a mini bus. He wants to start working on the local bus line, transporting locals from his village to the district. The new business initiative will hopefully increase the family's monthly income and improve their living

He states that the loan will certainly help him increase his business productivity by a fair percentage, which will return to him higher profits. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Rabih plans to take more Kiva loans and expand his lands by cultivating a wider variety of fruits and vegetables.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1299953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase the required agricultural tools and supplies, seeds, and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":115,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rabih","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355944097,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364664236,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-22T08:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373049556,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-25T08:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840755,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390699001,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399945218,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T18:20:25Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T19:11:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530885,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience is a 38-year-old mother of four children, aged 7, 10, 12, and 15 years. \r\n\r\nPatience sells fruits and vegetables in Kaloleni town.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBezhan opened a grocery shop recently where he sells different kinds of groceries and is grinding coffee as well. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nBezhan requested a loan for purchasing more stock of groceries, which will help his newly started business to develop.

cradle of Nicaraguan floklore and home to many crafters. She is 54 years old and married, and lives with her two daughters, who are adults, and her husband. She is a merchant by trade. She has had her own business, which she set up with her own money by sparing no effort, for five years. It consists in a small shoemaker's workshop with two employees that makes women's shoes, and in a small grocery shop that sells meals in the evenings. Francisca works both businesses together with her husband in order to improve their lot in life. She says she likes to try out new ideas for her business and to earn her money honestly, since that is how she was brought up. At this juncture, she needs to invest in her workshop, since she is facing an increase in custom. This is why she asks for a loan in order to buy the materials she needs to make shoes: Brazilwood, mirrors, cloth, black varnish, straw soles, fine cloth, velvet, thread, felt, white glue, yellow glue, rubber soles, and others.
