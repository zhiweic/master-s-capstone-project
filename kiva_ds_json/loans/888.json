is at the age of 53. He is married and has six children, three of whom are settled for marriage and are starting their new families. Chhum is involved in two businesses at the same time: a rice farming business and a granite mortar-and-pestle-making business. From the two business activities, he is able to raise his family and provide his children with basic necessities.

The Albanian government and international organizations have done a lot to integrate them into society, yet there's still more to be done. In the streets of major cities you still see parents and children sleeping on the cold cement, living in tents and barracks with no toilets or running water. \r\n\r\nThe VisionFund Albania is providing assistance to these communities through loans, and Flutur is one of its clients. She has applied for a second loan, with the first one being paid off. She has been selling new clothes in nearby villages for the past six to eight years. This business has proved profitable, despite the struggles in the beginning.\r\n\r\nFlutur\u2019s dream is to send her grandchildren to school.

Sadly, for a number of reasons, Mirian separated from her partner some years ago.  She now puts all her efforts into providing for her family.  She has always been a very hard-working, determined and enthusiastic woman.  Unfortunately, owing to her need to work and cover her expenses, she was not able to study for a college degree.

She works approximately eight hours a day, every day, in her business.  Early every morning, she goes out to her pens to clean, feed and care for her pigs.  She is happy with the work that she does because she has always enjoyed raising animals.\r\n\r\nMirian is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy feed for her pigs.  She will also vaccinate her young pigs.  This means she will be able to feed her animals and keep them in good condition.

Mendbayar, 31, is a hairdresser. She started her business two years ago in some rental rooms. She lives with her husband and her son in a ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads, and spotty electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her family owns a house, which she inherited from her parents, but it is old and uncomfortable to live in. Also, it emits heat through the walls and corners. It has become the main reason why she spends too much for coal and other fuels. So, that is why she wants to repair her house walls by installing insulation. She needs some building materials such as bricks, cement, rock, wool and other insulation materials. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C, even in the cities.  Also, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons Mongolia has so much air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and buy cars that run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan she is taking out will be used to buy materials for her house's wall insulation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1127341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She comments that she works alongside her husband, since she prepares the lunches and her husband is the one who distributes them in his workplace. Her business is located in her own home. She works Monday through Friday and organizes her hours according to her availability.\r\nShe buys the merchandise and supplies she needs in various supermarkets and food distributors. Sometimes she orders her merchandise from distributors and they deliver it directly to her home.\r\nOne of Maria's goals for her business is to enlarge her house in order to have a big store and therefore serve her customers more comfortably.\r\nWith the loan she will purchase a larger refrigerator, as well as vegetables, legumes and pasta, in order to stock up her business.\r\nMaria lives with her husband and her little 7-year-old son, who goes to school. Her dreams, as far as her family goes, are to take her son on a trip so he can see snow for the first time and also to sign him up for folkloric dance lessons.\r\nMaria is very glad and thankful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has given her, since it has allowed her to invest in her business. Furthermore, she feels very comfortable in the company of the other entrepreneurs from the communal bank, because they share various interests and activities which have also served as leisure moments for her. As for the training given in the meetings, she has learned to manage her business in a better way.\r\nTalca belongs to the region of Maule, located in the country's central area. It's the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region, and it's the most important town in the Chilean Central Valley. In Chile, Talca is curiosly referred to using the phrase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, Londres\" (\"Talca, Paris, London\"). Among the legends told about that, some say that it derives from the original saying by an Englishman, \"Talca parece Londres\" (\"Talca is like London\"), because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the town in wintertime, reminiscent of the capital of the United Kingdom."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1127665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to

It is the administrative, financial and cultural center of the region, being the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  There is a strange reference to Talca in Chile in a phrase which goes 'Talca, Paris and London'.  There are a number of myths surrounding this phrase. Some say that it comes from something an Englishman once said (\"Talca parece Londres\" - \"Talca is like London\") owing to the fog that frequently covers the city during the winter season, just as it does in the UK capital."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4325,"image":{"id":1127622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He also enjoys eating delicious <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lomo_saltado\">'lomo saltado'<\/a> together with his whole family.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his own initiative, and thanks to the support of his family, Pablo has been working on his small plot of land for many years.  He has a one hectare lot where he grows cotton and vines.  He gets up early every morning to work on his land.  In addition, he also works as a day laborer on a large farm near his home.  Pablo feels happy doing the work he does because he has always really enjoyed farming.\r\n\r\nPablo is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their support, he will be able to buy wood, poles and wire to replace his vine supports.  This will create better conditions for his crops and they will develop satisfactorily.  This will enable him to sell his crops and increase his income which he hopes to gradually use to finish building his house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1128031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy wood,

has been earning an income from rearing chickens for the past 10 years at her home. She works seven days per week at this business and does not have an additional source of income. She lives in Kampala with her husband and four children. All four children attend school. The family lives in a house with piped water but with no access to electricity. Her major monthly expense is her children's school fees. \r\n\r\nCaroline has requested a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 Uganda Shillings from MCDT-SACCO in order to enable her to buy more chicks and bags of chicken feed. Her primary challenges include seasonality and the ever-increasing prices of chicken feed. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to construct more chicken houses and eventually to own 2,000 chickens. She joined MCDT because of the good customer care exhibited by the staff.

is 40 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala west region of Uganda.

For the past six years, Ruth has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells spare parts. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Ruth has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more spare parts for resale, and will help Ruth to generate greater profits and open up more shops. Ruth hopes that in the future she will be able to start buying her goods from outside countries. \r\n\r\nRuth is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

She is widowed and lives with her daughter in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. She owns an apartment with 2 rooms. It is one of the old apartments which were built during the socialist era and most of them have never had any complete repair in the past years. So do, her apartment never had any big repair or renovation for many years.  This causes heat loss and emissions through the walls and windows. In the winter, she and her daughter feel very cold and always have cold or flu due to the cold rooms.  She  usually uses a furnace that uses coal to stay warm.  Tsendsuren wants to make a big repair to her house. This will include wall insulation. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reason for Mongolia's air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars which run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Tsendsuren is taking will be used to cover the cost of the insulation materials and installation for her apartment repair.

22, works as a janitor in a hotel in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. He has been working for 9 months. His salary is not so good and it does not meet with his monthly necessities often. He lives with his wife, a student, and his daughter in his old house which is in the ger district, an area of city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. Currently, his job is the main income source for his family. \r\n\r\nZolbayar's house has too much heat loss and emissions in winter. This is caused by old, bad walls and some other parts of his house and it costs much in coal fuel to warm his home. His daughter, 2, always has flu in the winter time. So, Zolbayar planned to repair his house. To start, he is planning to add wall insulation with bricks and cement. He thinks this will keep his home warm and there will be no more emissions after the insulation. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reason for Mongolia's air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Zolbayar is taking will be used to buy and install insulation for his house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1212.51,"image":{"id":1127325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

is Merlinda, 53, resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Benjamin, a driver, and is the mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to cover their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMerlinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 18,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMerlinda hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1127415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He also distributes merchandise all over the city to customers who pay on credit.  Through this business, he has managed to cover his household expenses.

His Kiva loan will increase his working capital and he will be able to respond to his buyers in a more timely fashion.  His customers remain loyal to his business because of his kind, genuine service.  Luis faced his biggest challenge when he arrived in this city because he had to adjust to its Caribbean culture which is different from the Andean culture.

Her home is located in Parcona district which is well known for the warmth of its residents.  It is also known for the 'bosque de piedras' (stone forest) where you can see rock formations in the shape of people, animals, etc.  Ana is the mother of three children who she has provided for on her own as her husband abandoned her.  Whenever Ana has any free time, she really enjoys watching television, especially her favorite soap operas.  She also enjoys eating one of her favorite dishes, the delicious 'carapulcra con sopa seca'.  Owing to her parents' lack of financial means, Ana was only able to study up to the fifth year of her secondary education.  However, she would have liked to have studied for a degree in Administration.  \r\n\r\nAna works in her business selling household goods such as irons, pans, rice cookers, plates etc with a lot of enthusiasm.  She works around 8 hours a day in her business and is able to serve up to 15 customers.  She believes that her business is doing well because she is very friendly with her customers.\r\n\r\nAna is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy merchandise for her business such as plates, jugs, cups, pans, etc.  This will allow her to have a wider range of products available with the 'patriotic holidays' period approaching.

","en":"62-year-old Nelly makes \"pasteles\", a typical Colombian pastry consisting of a mixture of dough or rice with vegetables, meat and other ingredients, which are wrapped in bijao leaves (similar to banana leaves), tied and then cooked. This business is a result of the tradition started by her mother, who remained in this line of work for many years and, when she passed away, Nelly carried on with her business. Many of her family members work in this micro-enterprise; they're in charge of food preparation and commercial distribution of the products. Thanks to this business Nelly has succeeded in getting her family ahead. Today she owns a house of her own and feels like an accomplished woman and an important member of her family. Her goal is to keep on working tirelessly in order to achieve more and more happiness and well-being for herself and for her family.

He lives in the town of Nazca with his wife and two children aged 14 and 12. When he has free time, he enjoys to read for a bit and on some occasions he prepares one of his favorite dishes, such as the delicious \"seco con frejoles\" (marinated lamb with beans). Dionisio has always been a very enterprising man who has worked since he was very young. Unfortunately, due to the need to pay for his expenses and help his parents, he couldn't finish elementary school, but he would like to complete it someday.\r\nOn his own initiative, and thanks to his enthusiasm and the support from his family, Dionisio started his business growing prickly pears. He works approximately 10 hours a day. He feels very good in his business, since he has always enjoyed the country and the work that is done there.\r\nDionisio is very thankful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help he will be able to cover the expenses of introducing cochineal insects throughout his prickly pear crop. That way he can take advantage of the season and get an abundant cochineal insect breed, so that when he finishes harvesting his produce, he will be able to get good profits from his sales. This will help Dionisio to achieve, little by little, his biggest dream of prodiving his beloved family with better living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1128903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to cover the expenses of introducing cochineal insects throughout his prickly pear crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-28T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-28T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionisio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3064.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088860,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-24T13:01:50Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:24:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":442666,"name":"Thamar","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Thamar  est n\u00e9e au Rwanda et a 50 ans.

Considering the low employment rate on the local labor market her sons are now working in Russia. Since 2000 Rabiya has been involved in animal husbandry, a business which became the main source of income for her family which she started with an amount of 30,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Rabiya now has one milk cow, two heifers and one bull as well as the sale of milk and dairy products to the local dairy factory which brings around 6,000 som a month.\r\n\r\nWith a goal to further grow her business Rabiya has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy two cows. She plans to invest the income from the loan into further increase of her livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1128212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase two cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Shopokov","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-06-28T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-28T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rabiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T09:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50078.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938682,"comment":null},{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50078.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862867,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T00:10:30Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":443645,"name":"Lilya","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d. \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441.\n\n\u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0432\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b  \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 15 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435. \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c.\n\n\u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 7,000 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430 -

lamentablemente por la necesidad de trabajar y solventar sus gastos no pudo cursar una carrera profesional, pero le hubiera gustado mucho poder hacerlo; en sus ratos le gusta dedicar un poco de tiempo a la lectura y en algunas ocasiones cocina un riqu\u00edsimo Arroz Chaufa para compartir con su familia.\nPor iniciativa propia y gracias al apoyo de su familia, Reyna arrendo una peque\u00f1a parcela donde cultiva pallar, ella dedica a su negocio un aproximado de 10 horas diarias, donde desde tempranas horas de la ma\u00f1ana ella se dedica a realizar las labores de campo que requiere su cultivo;

She has always been a hard-working, enthusiastic and entrepreneurial woman who puts all her effort together with her husband to get the family ahead.  Sadly, because of the need to work and cover expenses, she couldn\u2019t study to be a professional but she very much would have liked to have done so.  With her free time she likes to read and sometimes prepare a delicious  arroz Chaufa (Peruvian fried rice) to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and thanks to the support of her family, Reynda rented a small piece of land where she grows butter beans.  She spends about  10 hours a  day starting very early in the morning with the farm work that needs to be done.

She began her business because she was not educated so, therefore, she had to find an alternative way to generate income for the home and not to be dependent on her husband. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about SLL 500,000 every month from this business.

weaving, lives Mar\u00eda and her family. Mar\u00eda is a 30-year old married mother of two. Although Mar\u00eda was only able to attend school through sixth grade, she now has high hopes for the future of her children. \r\n\r\nFor many years Mar\u00eda and her husband have run a small business making garments. It was not until three years ago that Mar\u00eda realized that, in order for her business to continue to grow, she would need additional funding. As her clients\u2019 demands for her product increased, Mar\u00eda knew she would need to buy more raw materials than she could currently afford. As Mar\u00eda explains, \"we must seize the opportunities presented to us and not ignore them, because they only come once.\"  It was at this point that Mar\u00eda decided to join Friendship Bridge\u2019s Microcredit Plus program. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda recruited other women in her community to join with her and founded the Vision Trust Bank. Mar\u00eda is very happy and proud of herself and her fellow Trust Bank members for having the courage to take out loans and invest in their businesses. Mar\u00eda\u2019s loan has ensured that she and her husband always have the necessary materials on hand to produce what their clients order. Mar\u00eda's greatest achievement has been to provide employment for three more people (one woman and two men), meaning her microloan not only impacts her and her family but also her community.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Mar\u00eda plans to buy different types of fabrics and thread to diversify the products that she can produce. She currently delivers 25-30 orders of garments to her suppliers twice a month. Mar\u00eda\u2019s Trust Bank is about to begin its fifth loan cycle, providing nine women with funds that will help them develop their businesses. In addition to receiving loans, these women meet once a month to receive training from Friendship Bridge and to discuss topics such as business management, budgeting, self-esteem and health. These lessons not only provide the women with valuable information regarding their businesses and their family\u2019s health, but also foster a community of support among the women.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":1127704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the community of Patachaj, San Crist\u00f3bal Totonicap\u00e1n, Guatemala, in December of 2011, a group of 13 entrepreneurial women decided to form the Chucuxcabel Trust Bank, which is now about to begin its second loan cycle. Most of the women in the Chucuxabel Trust Bank are engaged in animal husbandry, weaving, embroidery and garment making, among other activities.\r\n\r\nOne of the 13 women in this Trust Bank is Santos, a 33-year old mother of three (two boys and one girl). While Santos herself was never able to attend school, she is happy to share that two of her children are already in primary school, which makes her very proud. In addition to running a small weaving business, Santos is currently engaged in animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan from Friendship Bridge, Santos began raising pigs. She started small, with only one pig, which she eventually sold for money that she put towards her children's education. Thanks to this first loan, Santos was also able to save some money, which she plans to combine with her second loan from Friendship Bridge to buy three more pigs, as well as thread for her weaving. Before Friendship Bridge, Santos had been unable to receive loans from formal banks, due to of her lack of education. This severely limited her ability to run a successful business. Now, thanks to Friendship Bridge, Santos has access to working capital and is thankful for the opportunity to overcome her difficult situation. \r\n\r\nSantos's dream is to see her business grow and provide more money for her family. She wants to, one day, have a bigger farm and build her own home (as she is currently renting). Santos meets with her Trust Bank once a month for training, where they participate in educational lessons on business, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, health and how to support their children\u2019s education. These lessons, combined with their loans, help them to provide a better life for themselves and their families. The women of Chucuxcabel are grateful for the people who trust in them, enabling them to obtain loans for their businesses and overcome the poverty that surrounds them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1127734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 3 pigs, and thread for weaving.

In particular, they have livestock with four cows, a calf, two bulls and two pigs. They are very hard-working people who take good care of their livestock. They milk their cows twice a day and produce dairy food: cheese, curds and yogurt. They sell the dairy foods that they produce in nearby villages. The family also owns 0.9 hectare of land, where nut-trees are grown. They sell the nuts in the Zestaponi market. In addition to his agricultural business, Goderdzi works in construction and earns additional income for the family. The total average monthly income of the family is 600 Lari.  \r\n\r\nGoderdzi has requested a loan to purchase a milking cow so he can expand his dairy farm.

While the price of feed and piglets is expensive, members of the group are already feeling the benefits from their first loan through their ability to meet the needs of their families. \n\nGroup member Ni Ketut will use her portion of the loan to buy a pig to breed. She has seen the possibilities in selling piglets. To reduce costs, she gave the mixture feed (feed mixture is a mixture of good quality feed which's purchase at store that is mixed with various types of leaves, such as banana leaves, taro leaves and other leaf types are useful for the growth of pigs). She hopes her pig venture will succeed and bring prosperity to the whole family.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1126049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a pig to breed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2012-06-28T04:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-28T04:50:06Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kade","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":19500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":19500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2075,"local_amount":19500000,"processed_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-16T10:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":19671000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331177651,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-28T22:10:15Z","paid_date":"2013-01-16T10:29:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":443309,"name":"Sylvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sylvia is 47 years old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala South region of Uganda.

He typically works about 10 hours a day, and can provide his services to as many as 30 customers in a day.

His motorcycle taxi consumes a lot of gasoline and oil, and so he is going to tune up the engine and also do general maintenance work.

En los alrededores de su negocio,  todos coinciden en ir a comprar en la tienda de Ana, porque es un lugar ameno y agradable, pues se sienten muy bien atendidos y esta percepci\u00f3n se extiende cada vez mas entre su clientela. Por eso en la mediada en que su negocio crece,  comprar de contado y en mayor volumen se vuelve cada vez mas, un desaf\u00edo. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual   Ana Ha recurrido a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para acceder a un credikiva, mediante el cual surtir\u00e1 su negocio de art\u00edculos que mas rotan diariamente, porque necesita tener un buen inventario para responder de inmediato a su clientela, que son las madres de familia que compran para preparar los alimentos de su familia. Su credikiva lo invertir\u00e1 en comprar refrescos, bebidas, l\u00e1cteos, enlatados, embutidos, aceite, arroz, legumbres y caf\u00e9. Su credikiva planea ser exitoso, porque lo hace en base a la demanda de su mercado y porque comprando en mayor volumen y de contado, ganar\u00e1 descuentos, que proporcionan sus proveedores, por este estilo de compra y esto es muy bueno para los ingresos de Ana.    ","en":"Ana, 49, has a store where she sells groceries, beverages, meats, dairy products and all kinds of goods for the family shopping basket.  Every day she sells on a cash basis and also buys her products in cash, weekly, biweekly and monthly, depending on product turnover.  Everyone living nearby coincides at Ana's store because it is a nice, friendly place and they feel well cared for, which is a growing sentiment among her clientele.  Therefore, as her business grows, buying more volume in cash becomes increasingly difficult.\r\n\r\nThis is why Ana has turned to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation for a CrediKiva loan.  This will allow her to keep a stock of the daily consumption products, since she has to have enough inventory to respond immediately to her customers, who are mothers who must prepare food for their families.  She will use her loan to buy soft-drinks, beverages, dairy products, canned goods, sausage, oil, rice, legumes and coffee.  Her loan is sure to be successful because she is basing her request on market demand, and her suppliers will give her discounts for buying more volume and paying in cash.  This will be beneficial to Ana's income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1128955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy soft drinks, beverages, dairy products, canned goods, sausage, oil, rice, legumes and coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-28T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-28T07:30:01Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Carmela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74775},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84430},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86400},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88416},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90479},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92590},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94751},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96962},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99224},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101539},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103909},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116525}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.01,"local_amount":74775,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":77636.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395497,"comment":null},{"amount":48.57,"local_amount":84430,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":87661.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775285,"comment":null},{"amount":49.7,"local_amount":86400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":89706.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387286,"comment":null},{"amount":50.86,"local_amount":88416,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":91800.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994116,"comment":null},{"amount":52.05,"local_amount":90479,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":93942.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519350,"comment":null},{"amount":405.81,"local_amount":705500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":732502.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967527,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-22T21:37:36Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":443527,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yolanda hails from Talibon, Bohol.

Force veteran John, 49, is a single father who decided to open his Kyle, Texas, business, Big Jon Plumbing Services, after working with major plumbing companies. John first entered the plumbing business at the age of 16 when looking for a summer job. Thereafter, he joined the Air Force where he attended plumbing classes to learn more. Upon leaving the Air Force, John received his plumbing license. He also helped build an Arizona start-up business to an established cooperation, but he was fired shortly after. That company later went out of business. After being fired from that job, John realized he could work for himself. \n\nJohn has now been in business for two years. For the time being, he works in conjunction with a helper. Passionate about work ethic, John would like to hire another person but won\u2019t until he finds the right one. He says it\u2019s easy to find a licensed plumber but it\u2019s a challenge to find a licensed plumber who wants to do the job right. According to John, all his employees should properly execute a job, clean up after themselves and be honest with customers. \n\nTo help with his expectations, John purchased a jetter with the funds he received on approval from Accion Texas Inc. He used the rest of the money to market his company. A jetter works similar to the water hoses at car wash stations but is much smaller as it is designed for pipes and drains. Other companies may bring a cable to expand a pipe\u2019s passage after buildup gained from years of usage; however, that only treats the symptom for possibly half a year. The jetter John purchased sprays 3,000 pounds of water to clean pipe walls, which should keep pipes clean for two to three years.\n\nThe Accion loan allows for an opportunity to build credit for his business; without it, John says he would have to wait another two to three months to earn enough money to purchase the jetter, which  would put a stop to the quality he can provide his customers.

Specializing in concrete, Israel works only on outdoor projects, such as foundation work, patios and outdoor kitchens. Benu Construction also creates concrete stamps to add d\u00e9cor to residential and commercial buildings.\n\nOriginally from Mexico, Israel struggled with English when he moved to Texas - which hindered his job search. Since he was unsuccessful in finding a job, Israel said he had to create a job for himself, which led to the creation of his construction company.\n\nDepending on the size of the project, Israel employs from one to ten people. He employs two full-time and ten part-time workers. Israel works with the client instead of a general contractor because he does not have enough capital to do that. However, working this way allows for more one-on-one communication between him and his client and brings better results.\n\nA returning client, Israel first found out about Accion Texas Inc. four years ago through the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, but he didn\u2019t apply for his first loan until he moved to Houston.  This is Israel\u2019s third loan. He plans to use it mainly to purchase cedar wood and concrete, but also to obtain concrete dyes and a concrete sealer.\n\nThe loan will give him job security, Israel said, as he will earn enough capital after his current project to go straight into work on another job. \n\nIsrael, who is the sole provider for his wife and child, also has a website for his company.

The main business activities in this community are growing sugar cane and collecting resin from rubber trees.\n\nArianna is one of the members of this group.  She is 25 years old and has a high school education.  She is married to Jose Luis who works as an agricultural laborer and the couple have one son.  Arianna tells us that her parents taught her to work when she was very young and when she got married she decided to find a way to help her husband with their household expenses so that they could save up and give their children a better life.  For a little over two years, Arianna has been running a small grocery store in her home.  She tells us that, at first, it was difficult to attract customers but she didn't become discouraged.  On the contrary, she attracted customers by providing good customer service and keeping her business stocked.  She is very happy with her store because she can work without having to neglect her family.  Even her husband helps her to serve the customers.  A loan from  Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad would help her to buy soap, oil, beans, rice, soup, toothpaste, napkins, sweet treats and soft drinks so that she can re-stock her business.  She hopes that, as a result of this investment, her business will continue to grow because she would like to be able to pay for her son's future education.\n\nThe other members of this group

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCarolina oversees operations of their tricycle transportation business. They have one tricycle that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. In her business the regular customers are the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy spare parts and accessories, as well to maintain the motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarolina dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. These meetings also give her an opportunity to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1128110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

El origen del nombre de la comuna viene del mapudungun (lengua mapuche): \"kila\", que significa \u201ctres\u201d y \"kura\" que significa \u201cpiedra\u201d, por lo que se deduce que el nombre de Quilicura equivale a \"tres piedras\", como  el nombre que le dieron los primeros habitantes de este valle en referencia a los tres cerros que son perfectamente visibles y que delimitan la comuna. \n","en":"This communal bank, called \u201cEmerging Sun\u201d, is composed of 15 entrepreneurs who are dedicated to commerce, specifically selling clothing, doughy bread, sweets, breakfasts, services, and a stallholder, among others. They all live in the commune of Quilicura, located in the city of Santiago. \r\n\r\nYesinia, president of the communal bank group, is standing in the front row of the photo, first on the left, dressed in a white 'beatle', under a gray vest and a brown jacket. Her dark chestnut hair is worn loose.\r\n\r\nYesinia has offered hair care for some 2 years. She has taken specialized courses that helped improve her skills and facilitated her business. She works Monday through Friday from 10:00 am until 9:00 pm, and also visits her customer's residences.\r\n\r\nYesinia buys her merchandise from various distributors who specialize in selling products for the hair. With this loan she will buy scissors, shaving implements, capes, caps, and gloves, among other items. One of Yesinia's goals for her business is to have an opportunity to acquire her own shop where she can attend to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband, a taxi driver, and her 7-year-old daughter who is a student. Yesinia's personal dreams are to have her own house and her own beauty shop, to generate greater income and thus, obtain a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nYesinia is very content and grateful for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza to invest in her business. In addition, she feels very comfortable with her group, since they are united, respectful, and confident.\r\n\r\nQuilicura is a commune pertaining to Santiago, Chile's capital, located in the extreme northeast of the metropolitan region. The origin of the commune's name comes from \u201cmapudungun\u201d in the Mapuche language: \u201ckila\u201d means 3, and \u201ckura\u201d means stone, which we deduce makes the name \u201c3 stones\u201d. The name was chosen by the original inhabitants, with reference to 3 hills that are clearly visible and mark the boundaries of the commune.

She started her business as an employment alternative for herself and her sister, because they could not find another opportunity to work within the educational system. They started out with very few children, but as word spread about the service they offered and the facilities they had for children, they grew quickly. Gradually, the needs of the community grew, and they asked her to become licensed to be able to teach primary grades. Today they are set up to be able to do so, and they have 80 children enrolled. As a faculty member, Iluminada makes sure the children are treated well. They want to grow the infrastructure of the school, which is why she has applied for a loan from kiva, the first loan she has taken out through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan she will buy teaching tools for child development, process paper work and make adjustments to the facilities so that with each day their facilities become more comfortable and full of happy children. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1129019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","use":"to buy teaching tools for child development, process paper work and make adjustments to the facilities.

She says that if she had a little extra money, she would buy blocks and sheets of lumber for building a pen since has no place to keep the animals at the moment.  Do\u00f1a Jose says that this is the first time she will be raising pigs, so she is very pleased to be starting this activity because she wants to help her husband with the household expenses.  Her only difficulty at the moment is that she does not have a pen to hold the pigs, but she hopes to get a loan in order to build one.  For Do\u00f1a Jose, one of her goals is to see her children finish their studies so that they can have better opportunities in life.  She would like to see them study for a degree.

Vandy has been with VisionFund since 2011 and successfully repaid a previous loan. The loan has enabled her to improve her living standard and to buy a mini tractor for plowing her rice farm. She now is applying for new loan with VisionFund with her group member who has been with VisionFund for four cycles. As the group leader, she is requesting a new loan in the amount of KHR 1,400,000 and she will use her portion of the loan to buy fertilizer (KHR 600,000) and hire a laborer to to plow her farmland (KHR 800,000).

The city is known for having a warm climate, and it is a city where you can visit lots of tourist attractions like the Nazca Lines [extensive hieroglyphics that according to some studies were used by the ancient Nazca culture as an astronomical calendar], the Cahuachi Pyramids, the Chauchilla Cemetary, and the Cantalloc Aquaducts.  These attractions, among others, allow us to admire and enjoy the magnificent Nazca culture.\r\n\r\nFredesvina has five children, ages 37, 33, 33, (twins), 24, and 15.  Fredesvina has known how to get her children ahead by herself.  This is because the father of her children abandoned her.  From that moment on she was mother and father to her children.  It is for them that she has worked and continues working.  She does this especially for her youngest child in order to give him a decent life and so that he becomes a good person.  The older children have already started their own lives.\r\n\r\nWhen Fredesvinda has free time she really likes to eat one of her favorite dishes \u201cSeco de Res\u201d [beef stew], which is delicious.  Sometimes she likes to read, especially the newpapers in order to be able to know what is happening in her city.  Due to her parents\u2019 small amount of financial resources, she only went to school until the first year of high school.  However, she would have liked to finish school.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day Fredesvinda works in her business selling vegetables at the fair grounds in her city.  She works around ten hours a day in her business, and she is able to tend to around 15 customers.
