37-year-old Abir from Aberdeen western area in Freetown, Sierra Leone. She is married with three children between the ages of eight and eighteen, who are currently attending school. In 2009, Abir established her general merchandise business. She began her business because she wanted to generate income to support her family. She works at the business every day except holidays.

We work to offer reliable, efficient, and affordable technologies to households to improve their livelihoods. \n\nWork in this sector began at SOSAI in 2010. The organisation had existed as a fully commercial company before this, but now we operate as a social enterprise. \n\nSOSAI was set up by Habiba, who is a founder, and who had worked for Developmental Association for Renewable Energies (DARE), where she had got the opportunity to carry out exhibitions and workshops for people in rural areas and urban slums highlighting the benefits of renewable energies. Because DARE is an NGO sales were limited by DARE, so Habiba decided to branch out to revive SOSAI. With benefitting people at the forefront, running this organisation as a social enterprise was paramount. \n\nThe idea behind the project of creating micro-enterprise by providing solar lighting is to empower small entrepreneurs who can penetrate more communities by giving them the opportunity to buy products and pay for them in installments, with an agreed upon plan and model. This will develop micro-enterprise, especially for women, while ensuring that a large number of people get all-important lighting into their homes, at the same time empowering more by giving them a means of livelihood. With the high number of households not connected to the grid--despite its rich energy resources--Nigeria is a fertile ground to grow this business as in the past 10 years (in spite of the government's promises) the power sector has only worsened with more power cuts and fewer people being connected to the grid. \n\nAccording to the WHO 1.6 million deaths occur yearly from indoor air pollution; this project will in the long run reduce green-house gas emissions while improving maternal health and ensuring basic education as longer study hours will be ensured. \n\nBenefits accruable to using Solar Home Systems as provided by Barefoot Power are immense, but the most important reason for SOSAI undertaking this comes from a personal experience Habiba has had with kerosene lamps while assisting her mother who owned a \"Bukka,\" a term used to describe a small eatery, where they worked till late at night using kerosene lamps. Her mother currently has an eye problem because of the exposure to indoor air pollution and Habiba herself wears glasses. What better drive to promote a cleaner source of lighting than personal experience? \n\nThe business model will be fully developed to include training for the business owners and training of technical staff that will ensure the warranty Barefoot Power prides itself in. \n\nThis loan will enable SOSAI to better promote this sales model and move deeper into the rural areas especially to give us the strength to be able to fall back and take on the steam at anytime. \n\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1198189,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2750,"youtubeId":"L9KUyO_dG0k","title":"Kiva Borrower Habiba from Tanzania","thumbnailImageId":1198189},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To sell solar lighting to people who doesn't have electricity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":22975,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Habiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":22975,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":22975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6975},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6975},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":474617,"name":"Bismarck Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bismarck Antonio se desempe\u00f1a como Guarda de seguridad desde hace 9 a\u00f1os, el ha sido un hombre  trabajador, responsable que le encanta el progreso, poco a poco a mejorado sus condiciones de vida y de su familia, en sus dias libre aprovecha su tiempo cultivando la tierra , sembrando raices y tuberculos y asi obtener un ingreso mas para ayudar a su familia.

With 80% of the population not having access to any kind of distributed electricity there was a lot of potential to improve people's lives by giving them access to basic electricity. Most people depend on car batteries and kerosene lights, which is inadequate, inefficient, labor intensive, and unsafe. \r\n\r\nNRG Solutions was established with the goal of providing sustainable, appropriate, and affordable solar energy solutions to Cambodia and S.E. Asia. Our team began working under the name Yejj Solar, as part of a larger NGO. This experience helped us learn about the local and regional market. We tested different models and approaches to the distribution of solar energy into remote areas. Earlier this year we decided to transition out of the NGO model into a social enterprise model, in order to improve sustainability as we saw the need to scale up. Our approach has two fundamental pillars: quality and service. We have slowly introduced Barefoot Power products in order to build the brand and trust in the products. By building a network of entrepreneurs to which we offer constant training and support we are pushing this emphasis of quality and service down to the end customer. This has quickly allowed us to differentiate ourselves from distributors of cheaper products with no after-sales service. \r\n\r\nYour contributions will help us bring much needed stock in order to meet the large demand and grow the business. This stock will then be given to local entrepreneurs we have trained to sell these products in very remote areas of the country, where they are most needed. This loan will help us in that final push to establish our business and the Barefoot Power products into a known and trusted brand. The largest challenge with solar energy in Cambodia is the lack of trust due to the availability of very cheap, low quality products, and no after-sales service support. Barefoot Power provides the best quality and easiest-to-service products in the market. \r\n\r\nOur efforts and patience in building trust in our brand has recently and quickly translated into larger and larger demand. We are currently not able to meet demand due to lack of funds to place larger orders, which can be solved with initial financing. We envision a network of entrepreneurs all over the country reaching the most remote and needed families, in order to make a significant difference in their lives with reliable, adequate, modern, and green energy. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1200079,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2751,"youtubeId":"UwMMXRB5dIQ","title":"Kiva Borrower Daniel from Cambodia","thumbnailImageId":1200079},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To sell renewable solar lighting ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Phnom Penh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.55 104.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":16000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":16000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":11200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":475459,"name":"God Gee Women-I Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the photo are members of the \u201cGod Gee Women I\u201d group.
