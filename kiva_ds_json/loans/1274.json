Almagul has a secondary education. She is a homemaker. After the death of her husband, it took her a long time to recover, as she had lost she the person closest to her and her family's breadwinner. Thanks to her children, she gradually came round. The first of the tasks and problems she needed to figure out was how to feed her children and family. She decided to take up animal breeding, as all of her fellow villagers do.  \r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for her family, Almagul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Almagul's hard work and the active assistance from her children, she currently has 2 calves and 40 sheep on her farm, as well as a 1.0 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans and potatoes. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). Almugal entered into the farming group \"Zeta-2.\" There are already 2 people in this group; she is the third member. \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of further developing her business, Almagul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy bulls to increase the size of her herd. Almagul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to buy a plot of land."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1476582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy bulls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Say village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T10:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T10:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Almagul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":615},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-29T15:05:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637414,"name":"Akram","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akram is a 48-year-old married man from Tulkarm City.

Her dreams as a mother are to support her children until they complete their studies and to meet all their needs and anything else that comes up on their life journey.\r\n\r\nVirginia is currently seeking a loan to buy supplies such as manure and fertiliser to help her with her current potato crop. Thanks to this loan she will be able to improve and stabilise her financial situation while hoping to get a good harvest of potatoes out of her crop."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0.03,"image":{"id":1476138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Her husband is a farmer and their children help with the farm. Kachkymbubu has a secondary specialized education. She graduated from a chef training school. She started her career path in a school cafeteria and for a long time, she worked as a chef in a food court.  She currently works in a secondary school cafeteria while simultaneously practicing animal breeding and crop farming with her family. \r\n\r\nShe started this business 20 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Kachkymbubu's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow, 3 horses and 2 stallions on her farm, as well as a 1.80 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans, potatoes and perennial grasses. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). Kachkymbubu entered into the agricultural group \"Diana.\" There are two other members of this group, three of them in total.

Tynar has a higher education. She and her husband work as teachers at a local school and are well-respected in their village, as they both are good people and professional educators. They are good role models, as they not only work in a school, but also simultaneously practice animal breeding and cultivate a 3.0 hectare plot of land. \r\n\r\nTynar was the initiator of all this, starting this business business 20 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Tynar's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 4 calves, 20 sheep and 1 horse on her farm, as well as a 3.0 hectare plot of land on which she grows pumpkins, potatoes and perennial grasses. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). Tynar is in the agricultural group \"Diana.\" There are two other members in this group; Tynar is the second member of the group. \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of further developing her business, Tynar turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy heifers to increase the size of her herd. Tynar plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

Besides, it requires a lot of dedication and gives you the opportunity to show you love your neighbors.\r\n\r\nThis loan is of great importance in order to cover my needs at the university. In case I do not get it, I would have to interrupt my studies because I do not have the resources to continue since it costs a lot to do so. This is to say that it would totally change my life to get it and I would have the strengths I need to pursue my degree.

He started doing this five years ago, when he bought a cow for 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to his hard work, his farm now has 1 dairy cow, 10 sheep, and 1 horse. He also has 1.5 hectares of land on which he grows beans, potatoes, and clover. Their monthly income is 6,000 som (KGS). Urmat is joining the Diana group, which has two other members.  With the goal of further developing his business, Urmat has turned to the Bai-Tushum & Partners micro lending bank for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy bulls for increasing the size of his herd. He plans on investing the income earned with the loan onto further increasing his livestock herd, and plans on saving up money to build a new house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1476829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy bulls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T13:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T13:50:07Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urmat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-21T15:04:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637448,"name":"Sauoleola","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sauoleola is 31 years old and has three children.

","en":"Hosiyat is the loving mother of three children. Her husband divorced her and now lives in Russia, but she is a very strong woman. After the divorce, she did not waste time or lose hope. Instead, she started her own business and opened a cafe. Her daughter helps her prepare Tajik specialties for the local residents. Many people come to her cafe for lunch.

After her husband died, she became the sole breadwinner for her four children. Tuhtajon is an honest worker and works as a cleaner at the local hospital, but it is hard to raise her children on her small salary. Now that her sons are grown they help her provide for the family.

The children are all students; the eldest is 13 years old, and the youngest is 9. Urkuya has a specialized high school education, and graduated from a technical school with the specialty of cook. Her husband is engaged in offering passenger services to the local population. <br \/><br \/>The family is young and friendly. The spouses have been teaching the children from a young age all the good qualities such as industriousness. After school, the children help their parents. As a main source of income for her family, Urkuya is engaged in raising livestock, having started 12 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Urkuya currently has on her homestead: two dairy cows, one calf, and 30 sheep, and also has a 2.1-hectare share of land, on which annually she grows peppers, beans and clover. Monthly income consists of 12,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Urkuya turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tusham and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase cows to increase her cattle head count. <br \/><br \/>Urkuya plans to invest income from the loan in further increasing the quantity of domestic livestock, and plans to save money for the further education of her children. Urkuya considers herself an exemplary mother and a happy mother."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1476859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bala-Sary village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urkuya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-06T03:07:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637522,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth is 50 years old and married with four children.

She is in a civil union, and her partner is both a builder and a farmer. She completed primary school. The couple lives alone in their house, as they have no children. Carminda has a shop but works on the family farm during the week, helping her partner tend to the coffee crops. On weekends, she sells fruits and vegetables in her area's town market. The couple bought the plot of land thanks to money inherited from their respective parents. They grow a great variety of crops, and the land is located some 3 kilometres from their house. They go there by foot, since there is no other transport available. Carminda hopes for an excellent harvest this year, since the household's finances depend on it. They sell the coffee to middlemen who come to their village. Her main goal in asking for this loan is to buy fertiliser, various types of manure, and fungicides, in order to avoid the spread of disease ruining the crops.

He stole, and then got to the point where he tried, and then allowed his life to be destroyed by, hallucinogenic drugs. Years later, Diana met a young man who was older than she was, and became pregnant by him.  He then abandoned her, without any concern for the fate of the child.  Later, in order to get ahead, she took a job helping an acquaintance sell fruit in the streets of the city.  In this way she was able to help her mother pay the bills and to support her child.  She then met another young man, with whom she began living and had a second child.  However, after a while he began to abuse her physically and verbally, so Diana decided to leave their home.  She found a job in the bakery where she now works, takes care of her children, and studies with great effort and dedication. Her vision is to obtain a professional degree that will guarantee her job stability, in order to provide her children with a good future and a home to share with her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1463051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"to complete her technical work training.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T16:50:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Mireya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":282672.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845834,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":141336.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439696793,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T17:46:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636474,"name":"Sofia Ivania","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sof\u00eda, disfruta de su familia la cual est\u00e1 integrada por su esposo y su hija, vive junto a ellos, se dedica a elaborar panes con pollo, pupusas y comida, ya tiene mucho tiempo con su negocio, lo atiende sola en algunas veces su esposo la apoya, por el momento no ha tenido ning\u00fan problema en atenderlo.\nCon el cr\u00e9dito comprara carnes, embutidos, verduras, condimentos, bebidas, gas propano, etc., todo lo necesario para preparar los diferentes tipos de alimentos que vende.

She has four children: two are in school, while two have finished school. <p>\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, for three years in her area, she has been running several businesses, including a beauty salon, a mini supermarket, Max malipo, and a transportation business. She works from 8 am to 10 pm everyday, which allows her to earn good monthly profits. <p>\r\n\r\nThis would be Salama's third loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans to start Max malipo, restock her supermarket, and open a beauty salon. Proudly, she notes that she fully repaid both of her prior loans. She used the profits generated as a result of the prior loans to pay school fees and household expenses, and she saved the remaining funds in her bank account.

She is requesting this loan to help cover tuition costs for her degree. This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Danilsa, and I am 18 years old. I was born and raised in Santo Domingo, and I currently live there with my parents and siblings. I am the third of five children in our family, and we all live in a small house in the Azul de los R\u00edos neighborhood.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I was very young, I loved school and academic work. I always put forth my best effort in all my classes, and as a result I am now studying Business Administration at O&M University. I am in my third semester of the program, and my favorite course subjects thus far include: administration, accounting and financial mathematics. I chose this career specifically because I love all the practical applications of Business Administration: working with clients, business concepts, being on a team with coworkers and the responsibility that comes along with being a professional and an entrepreneur. I can't imagine myself in any other field, and I hope to leverage my education and professional skills to support my family and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nMy family is facing several financial challenges and strains at the moment, so a loan like this gives me the best chance to be able to stay in my university program. As a family of seven with five children, my mother works as a cook in a private home and my father works on contract with a decorations company. Both of them make minimum wage and are no longer able to help me with tuition costs. I sincerely thank you in advance for your support and generosity, and for the opportunity to pursue my degree and my life dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1476300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He is only 20 years old. He wants to start a business buying and selling cattle. Faridun, despite his young age and lack of experience, is not afraid to start a business. This is because most people in Istravshan work in animal husbandry. Faridun knows that he can go to his neighbors for advice whenever he needs it. Faridun's parents also work in animal husbandry, but they are keeping their animals to take care of their personal needs. Faridun plans to use all of the experience he has gained from his parents in his own business. \r\n\r\nTo start the business, Faridun must buy several head of cattle. Unfortunately, he doesn't have enough money to buy the cattle, so he is asking for a loan. This loan is very important to Faridun.

She is 26 years old, has a one-year-old son, and owns her own business. The community of Sugura village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Sugura\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Sugura, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Doreen has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Teresia, Miriam, Josephine and Beatrice.\n\nSugura village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Doreen believes that the dispenser will save people from sickness and death in her community. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Doreen\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"to install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T18:30:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doreen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T20:13:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":629557,"name":"Grace's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace, a 53-year-old woman with 5 children, lives in Shivembe B village in Kisasi, Kenya.

She lives with her common-law husband, who is her only support with the work done in the fields to provide for the household. She is the mother of their only child, a 4-month-old son. Her only income comes from the coffee crop, and she has done this job for 5 years. She learnt it from her parents, who were coffee growers by tradition, and who made use of knowledge passed down from generation to generation.

He lives in Gimudi village in Vihiga in Kenya. Gimudi village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Stephen and his family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nStephen grows crops for food, but has also volunteered his time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables his community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Stephen and other promoters in his community (including: Thomas, Francis, David and Sarah) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Stephen will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. He wants to be a promoter because he likes serving the community. Stephen believes that the dispenser will provide chlorine that kills bacteria and hence prevents illness.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Stephen\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"to reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T19:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T19:10:07Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thomas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-29T16:07:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637592,"name":"Asma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asma is age 27 and lives with her family in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

Hesbon and other promoters in his community (including Vincent, Violet, Hildah and Laban) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area.

Hesbon believes that the dispenser will prevent diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorine lives with her 2 children in a house made of mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof in Musanyi village in Kenya, Kenya. The community of Musanyi village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Musanyi\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Musanyi, 60 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Dorine has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Eglay, Simon, Ronald, and Florence.\n\nMusanyi village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

Beatrice and other promoters in her community (including Janet and Phanike) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area.

She is 22 years old and has a 2-year-old daughter. The community of Kaptaisi village collects their drinking water from an unprotected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kaptaisi\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Kaptaisi, 20 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Susan has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Wanalo\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Wanalo, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Joyce has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

husband. All of her children are now married and live independently, except for the middle son, who lives in Jumabubu's house together with his wife and kids. Her youngest son and his wife are working in Kasahstan. Jumabubu has a high school diploma and raises livestock, which is the main source of income for her family. The livestock business was started 12 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS). Due to Jumabubu's diligent work, her herd has now expanded to: one milk cow, 5 horses and 20 sheep, and the animals provide the family with 12,000 som (KGS) monthly profit. Jumabubu's husband actively helps her with the livestock. Every morning he takes the animals out to pasture, while Jumabubu cleans out the barn, changes water and puts up hey. The two work happily together. In order to further expand the herd Jumabubu has applied for a loan to micro-finance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to finance the purchase of another horse. She plans to continue investing the profits from the loan into the livestock business, continue expanding her herd and save money to help pay for the education of her grandchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She has a professional degree as an administrative assistant and typist and also received a retail associate certificate from a business college. For a while Elmira worked as a secretary for various organizations, but when she married she stopped working, focusing on managing the household and raising her children. Elmira has a large family: two sons and two daughters. The kids, with the exception of the youngest son, are married and live separately. The youngest son still lives with his parents and actively helps them with the household. Elmira's husband is a taxi driver and the main income for the family comes from their livestock herd. The family farm was started 21 years ago with 3,500 som (KGS) and has now expanded to include: one milk cow, one calf, two horses, 15 sheep, 25 turkeys, 30 chickens and 8.8 acres of land where the family grows beans, potatoes and hay. During winter, Elmira also sells the milk from her cow and horses, generating additional income. The monthly income from the farm is 9,500 som (KGS). In order to further expand the livestock business, Elmira has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan. She plans to use the loan to buy a steer for the herd. Elmira will use profits from this expansion to buy more animals and eventually save enough money to build a house for her son.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy steers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nyldy village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-07T02:58:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":629812,"name":"Chris' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"33 year old Chris has 4 children and lives in Ilali village in Vihiga in Kenya. Ilali village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Chris and his family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nChris works as a subsistence farmer, but has also volunteered his time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables his community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Chris and other promoters in his community (including: Betty, Boniface, Absalom and Mercyline) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Chris will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. He wants to be a promoter because he wants to be a steward of development. He finds it an achievement when his community can access safe water.

Elizabeth is a hardworking trustworthy well-known well-liked member of the community with 3 children. She lives with her family in a house made of concrete walls, concrete floor, and an iron roof.\n\nLukose village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from an unprotected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Elizabeth and the 16 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nElizabeth has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Elizabeth volunteered to be the promoter because she believes it is good to assist others and she wants to help the community to fight germs that cause waterborne diseases. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Grace, Sarah and Pauline.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.

She has no children but is planning to start a family soon. The community of Matrini B village collects their drinking water from a municipal water supply because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Matrini B\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Matrini B, 20 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Terry has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. Two other volunteer promoters (Gladys and Ronald) from the surrounding community are part of this group loan.\n\nMatrini B village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Terry believes that the dispenser will provide safe water which will improve health and help prevent diseases. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Terry\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"to provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T20:50:05Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Terry ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T01:33:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637688,"name":"Tulibamu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine, aged 39 years, is married with three children, who are 12, 10 and 11 years old.

Two of her kids are school age and two are still babies. Her youngest son isn't even one year old yet. Gulshan has a high school degree, she is a home maker and raises her children, as well as takes care of her small farm. The farm is the main source of income for the family and was started 13 years ago with the 10,000 som (KGS). Due to Gulshan's diligent work the family now owns two milk cows, two calves, 10 chickens and has 3 acres of land where they grow potatoes and beans. Gulshan's husband is a taxi driver and also works as a mechanic at a auto repair shop. Since the kids are all still young, Gulshan's husband works hard to save money for their future and is a very active father. The total monthly income of the family is 10,000 som (KGS). In order to expand the livestock herd, Gulshan has turned to micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase another cow. She plans to use the profits from the loan to continue expanding the family's herd and save money for her children's college education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nyldy village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T20:50:05Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulshan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T02:16:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636530,"name":"Ana Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana desde hace 16 a\u00f1os se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de pupusas trabaja 4 d\u00edas a la semana, su negocio lo tiene ubicado en la calle principal de su colonia, posee mucha clientela por la amabilidad e higiene que tiene a la hora de elaborar los alimentos, con lo que obtiene de su trabajo y con la ayuda de su esposo logran solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, vive en casa propia con su esposo y sus 3 hijos de 19, 16 y 4 a\u00f1os de edad, Ana est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de los materiales necesarios como: chicharr\u00f3n, quesillo, frijoles, ma\u00edz, tomates, repollos, aceite, etc. para poder seguir con sus cenatas que le generan buenas ganancias y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 darle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.

3-month-old baby. She sells food and lunches from her stand which is located in the Santa Rosa zone. This loan is her first with the institution, and Shirley will use it for the maintenance and repair of her stand. She will also buy work material for her business. \r\n\r\nShirley's reason for requesting this loan is that she needs to repair her kiosk and also cement the base of the stand. She faces such challenges in her business as having to get up to prepare the food very early when it's cold out, and she is prone to catching rheumatism which is very common among people who do this work. She will use the proceeds to buy supplies, and tables and chairs so she can sell more comfortably and offer good service to her customers. Her wish for her business is to have a more varied and larger menu so she can sell more and better products and thus get ahead in life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1476360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy work

daughters and a son with her husband. Chinar's husband is now retired. Chinar herself has a high-school degree and manages the family farm, which is their main source of income. The farm was started 20 years ago with a purchase of a cow with 2,000 som (KGS). Chinar's hard work and the help of her children have grown the farm and the family now owns 5 milk cows, 3 calves, 40 sheep, 1 horse and 12 acres of land where they grow beans, potatoes and hay. Every year the family collects an abundant harvest because Chinar has a lot of experience growing crops. She takes care of her fields day and night so that she can improve the financial lot of her family. Chinar also has a veterinarian examine her animals twice a year and puts up all the hay and feed for her livestock together with her children.  In summary, Chinar has all the facilities and equipment to take care of livestock. The monthly income from the farm is 8,000 som (KGS). In order to further expand her herd, Chinar has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy more sheep.

Joash is a friendly, goal-oriented, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, well-known and well-liked member of the community with 6 children. Joash lives with his family in a house made of concrete walls, concrete floor, and an iron roof.\n\nChimusien village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Joash and the 20 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nJoash has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Joash volunteered to be the promoter because he is willing to serve the community and he wants to help the community by killing bacteria thus making the drinking water safe. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Samson, Emily, and Escah.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Joash\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"to allow the community to treat their water to make it safe to drink using chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T21:10:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T21:10:27Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joash ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Escah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-29T14:12:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637700,"name":"Sophiko","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophiko is a 28-year-old married woman.

The community of Senende village collects their drinking water from an unprotected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Senende\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Senende, 15 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mary has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. Two other volunteer promoters (Joan and Henry) from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan.\n\nSenende village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Mary believes that the dispenser will provide safe water that will help prevent waterborne diseases. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Mary\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"to support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T21:30:05Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T16:23:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637731,"name":"Elizabeth's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is made up of three members and the leader is Elizabeth, who makes a living selling designed beads from the wholesale market in the city of Accra-Teshie.

After the death of her husband Toraim's family lost their main provider. After asking her children for advice, Toraim agreed to send her eldest son and his wife to Russia for work. Her son and daughter-in-law live and work in Russia and send a part of their earning back to the family every month. The rest of the children still live with Toraim and help around the house. Toraim has a high school degree and she manages dairy business, which is the main source of income for the family.  The dairy business was started 18 years ago with a purchase of a cow with 8,000 som (KGS). Toraim's hard work has grown the herd and the family now owns 8 milk cows. Toraim and her daughters milk all the cows and sell the milk. The monthly income from the farm is 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further expand her herd, Toraim has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy another milk cow. She will use the profits from the loan to buy more livestock and save money to improve her family's

She is \"Mother Hero\", as she is raising six children. Her husband works as a specialist at the farming co-op's office. Kanyshay herself has a college degree and works as a teacher in the local school. She is liked and respected by other villagers. Kanyshay has educated many generations of children and some of them have become doctors, teachers, economists and chefs. Her students say that she is a smart and fair teacher and a thoughtful and idealistic human being. Even now Kanyshay is teaching many students because she loves her work. Unfortunately the salary of a teacher is not enough to feed her family and Kanyshay is earning additional income by raising livestock and farming. She started 20 years ago by buying livestock with 8,000 som KGS. Kanyshay's hard work has grown the farm to include 6 milk cows, 15 sheep and a small plot of land where she grows sunflowers. Every fall Kanyshay takes her harvest to a pressing plant and has own sunflower seed oil for family's consumption. The monthly income from the livestock is 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further expand her herd, Kanyshay has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy more cattle. She will use the profits from the loan to continue expanding the herd and save money to repair the family's home.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jiyde village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T21:30:05Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanyshay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":621.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-06T03:47:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":629875,"name":"Rose's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 47 years old, has 4 sons, and lives in Gamgeni village in Vihiga, Kenya.

After graduating from the Pedagogical University she started to work at the local school. Dilafruz is an elementary school teacher and loves her works, as she enjoys teaching young children. Dilafruz always tries to improve her teaching skills and incorporates new teaching methods so that her students learn and retain the information they learned. Dilafruz plans to repair her house, as it is in a bad state. She doesn't have enough money saved to finance all of the repairs, as a teacher's salary is very modest. In order to buy construction supplies for house repairs, Dilafruz has turned to IMON for a loan of 2000 somoni. Dilafruz is a repeated client with IMON and has a good credit history.

","en":"Sheraly is a caring father and a loving husband. He is 28 years old and lives with his family in southern Tajikistan. Sheraly has started his business four years ago. He purchases fabrics wholesale, distributes them among seamstresses who make traditional Tajik dresses from home. Sheraly then sells the dresses at the local market from his own market stall. Every season Sheraly changes the inventory of dresses he has for sale to keep his store competitive. His wife helps Sheraly in this business. Now, with the fall and winter season upon us, Sheraly needs to refresh his inventory but he doesn't have money for a wholesale purchase of fabrics. Sheraly has turned to KIVA for a loan of 3000 somoni which he will use to buy fabrics.

","en":"Mahmadabror was born in 1963 in the city of Norak. He is married and lives with his wife and their four children, who are in school. He has raised farm animals for nearly his entire life. When he was a child he helped his father send cattle to pasture every morning. Now Mahmadabror raises cattle on his own, continuing the work of his father and grandfather.

","en":"Dilnoza is a young and goal-oriented 24 year old woman. She is not married and lives with her parents. After finishing high school Dilnoza was not accepted to the university, so she has no college degree. Currently, she works as a cleaning lady in a school. Her mother is also a cleaning lady at the same school. They work together. Dilnoza dreams of getting accepted to college so that she can earn a college diploma.

Faith is a goal-oriented, hard-working, well-liked member of the community with 2 sons who are 10 and 13 years old. Faith lives with her family in a house made of mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof.\n\nBukhevera village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Faith and the 40 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nFaith has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Faith volunteered to be the promoter because she is a people person and she wants to help the community by promoting good health. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Zipporah, Hezron, Peter and Loileen.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.
