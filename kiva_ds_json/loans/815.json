is 24-year-old Sulaiman. He is single and has one child, age 3 years. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sulaiman established his DVD, VCD  and television business. He began his business because he wants to enhance his independence and that is the sole source of livelihood. \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000.

They are local entrepreneurs who have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to apply for a loan of 500,000.00 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) for each. With the help of this loan, they will be able to expand their businesses, increase their sales, and consequently improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nDora, age 49, is the leader of this group.

is 60-year-old Ya-Almamy. She is married and has 3 children, ages 38, 34 and 23 years. She has no additional dependents that live with her.  \r\n\r\nIn 1992, Ya-Almamy established her provisions business. She began her business because she did not go to school. Therefore, at the age of 20, her parents gave her for marriage to a business tycoon. As a hardworking woman, she decided to request from her husband to establish her own business and not to depend on the husband alone. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,050,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Ya-Almamy requests a loan in order to buy 60 tins of blue plate mayonnaise @ 15,000, 100 tins of luncheon meat @ 9,000, and 4 bags of sugar @ 280,000.

Most of the members carry out a variety of economic activities like crafts sales, food sales and others provide services.\r\n\r\nJosefa is 45 years old, married and has two children.  She was born in the city of Cusco and still lives there.  Josefa\u2019s main economic activity is selling clothes like pants, shirts, blouses, jackets, polo shirts and other things.  On this occasion, Josefa needs a loan to buy more merchandise.  Her dream is that her children become professionals.\r\n\r\n(The members who appear at the bottom of the photograph asked permission on the day of the meeting.)\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":1037201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2012-03-20T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-19T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saby Clorinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel Serapio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Karla Ximena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Junior","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yonny Eneida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gissella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2027.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2108.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2191.99},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2271.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":760.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":790.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":822},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":851.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":760.47,"local_amount":2027.92,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269972540,"comment":null},{"amount":790.64,"local_amount":2108.38,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2108.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276579503,"comment":null},{"amount":822,"local_amount":2191.99,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T10:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2192.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283400536,"comment":null},{"amount":851.89,"local_amount":2271.71,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2272,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287096972,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T01:29:10Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:26:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403528,"name":"Gia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gia is 42 years old.

He lives alone in a village of Akhmeta District. Vasil is employed as a building worker in the village and earns 250 Laris per month. According to Credo estimations, he belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \n\nVasil requested credit for restarting of an agricultural business. Two years ago he was running a cattle-breeding business, but he sold the cattle, as he didn\u2019t have a job for a long time and needed money to finance daily costs for food. Now he received a loan in the framework of a start-up loan program, initiated jointly by Credo and Kiva. This program aims at provision of business start-up or business re-start loans to Georgian rural poor, who do not have access to regular credit products, as they live in poverty and are regarded as \u201cborrowers with high risk of default\u201d. \n\nWith the requested loan, Vasil will purchase calves and raise them for 5-6 months. In early fall he will sell calves and get income. Vasil plans to expand the business in the future, through purchasing more and more calves. The business will give Vasil additional income and he will be able to live in better conditions. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1044322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Koghoto","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-03-20T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-19T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vasil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":535.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":535.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.63,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276706596,"comment":null},{"amount":1194.37,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1970.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283194557,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-27T13:39:20Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:22:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":404895,"name":"Naana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naana sells cooked rice and wakye (rice and beans cooked together).

With this loan, he will buy grocery products to sell in the store. He will work as the salesman himself. Another part of the loan will be used to buy products for his canteen. There will be three persons employed by the canteen \u2013 a cook, one waiter and one dishwasher\/cleaner. According to Zelimkhan\u2019s estimations, both businesses will be profitable and will expand in the future. \r\n\r\nZelimkhan\u2019s loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo, ocurri\u00f3 cuando se enferm\u00f3 hace 2 a\u00f1os y esto afect\u00f3 la productividad de su negocio, pero como Merys no se rinde f\u00e1cilmente, ha logrado salir adelante. Por eso hoy acude a su credikiva, cuarto financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n, con el comprar\u00e1 materias primas e insumos por volumen,  para responder a pedidos de uniformes de colegios, con los cuales ha contratado. Su inversi\u00f3n ser\u00e1 exitosa porque la hace sobre convenios escolares y su experiencia  y tenacidad es parte de su personalidad exitosa que potencializa el logro esperado.","en":"\nMerys, 54, lives with her husband in the town of Malambo; they have three children whose ages range from 19 to 30 years.  She has a sewing business in this town that started in the city of Barranquilla when she took a technical course in this field through which she learned.  Later during three years she worked sewing on order for her family and friends and for the last 17 years when she moved to this town she started her enterprising idea in an organized fashion getting in contact with several schools.  \n\nShe\u2019s been part of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo programs for the last four years, an organization from which she\u2019s received three loans that have provided enough working capital for her to meet customer demand.  She\u2019s been able to use her income to provide schooling for her children.  Her goal for later on is to have a straight stitch sewing machine to improve production times and quality of items.  Her greatest challenge occurred two years ago when she became ill and this affected her business\u2019 productivity but since Merys is not easily defeated she\u2019s managed to get ahead.\n\nThis is why she\u2019s today calling on a Kiva loan, her fourth financing from the Fundaci\u00f3n that she\u2019ll use to buy raw materials and supplies in volume to fill orders for school uniforms she\u2019s been contracted to do.  Her investment will be successful because she works based on contractual agreements with schools and her experience and tenacity are parts of her successful personality which makes her expected accomplishment possible.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1032988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

Her group is located in Samana, a lush and rugged peninsula with a nascent tourism industry. She is a single young mother with a child who is working hard to pay her university fees and become a  professional -- this is her most important challenge.  She also wants to establish her business by building a local shop on a plot of land next to her house.\r\n\r\nHaving repaid her previous loans and grown her business, Adriana is excited to be taking her 8th loan with Esperanza. She has had her business for around five years, cooking food and delivering it to people. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying a freezer and more goods like rice and beans. She will use the additional profits to save and supply some of the needs for her only child and for her home.

She sells a variety of merchandise. and has been doing this work since the the time she was studying for her high school diploma, and was selling magazines, candy, and everything her fellow students were able to buy from her. \r\n\r\nGradually, as she moved forward in life, she realized she could generate income through business, and worked to add many more products to the merchandise she sold, by using specialized guides. This is how she began her work of attracting customers. \r\n\r\nToday it is a business through which she helps supports the functioning of her household. Because by selling beauty products and clothing, she has managed to go to school and deal with her personal expenses for six years. \r\n\r\nCurrently, her greatest challenge is to achieve enough income to serve her customers, especially when the magazines or catalogs offer special discounts. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she is applying for her credikiva loan, her first from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

He decided that he could help the Army by building quality, durable products that could be purchased much cheaper than from the current production facilities. \r\n\r\nGary decided to follow up on this endeavor by founding his own enterprise. His greatest success came with the development of the BiCon, a military suited shower\/latrine facility, in 2009. In 2010, he had planned to seriously market this product; however, his plans were halted when he was sent to travel  internationally for long spans with his full-time job. For the next two years he only had the opportunity to push his smaller, less significant products. \r\n\r\nGary is determined to start selling the BiCon in 2012. He is asking for a loan to help him actively sell the BiCon through traveling to different trade shows and starting a marketing campaign. He now employs two other workers.

They have a fruit stand, which he started when he began selling mangoes and plums in front of a school.  His biggest market were the children who came out of the school at the end of the school day.\r\n\r\nAs he didn't have many customers during the kids' holidays, he decided to go sell on the street.  This was how he proposed to the administrator of a business that he sell a variety of fruit in the transportation center that she managed.  He noted to her that he would maintain a good stock which would meet the needs of the passengers.  It was in this way that he started at this location, and today he has been here for six years.\r\n\r\nAs things continue to go much better for him, he feels satisfied.  However, his plan for growth is greater than his working capital, which is the reason why he's come for a Kiva loan.  This his first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will purchase a greater volume of fruit so as to have a diverse stock at the fruit stand that his wife tends to at their home.  He will also improve his fruit cart, and purchase uniforms to show his hygienic food handling together with an excellent business image.

is married with seven children between 27 and nine years of age. Four of his children are still in school.\n\nIn addition to his business selling household goods in the local market, David is a farmer whose products include milk and tea. He has been farming for twenty years and now engages the services of a  farmhand.

She has a motorcycle parts store, a business she started with her husband's friend nine years ago. At the time, her husband's friend contributed most of the funds while she and her husband provided the locale and administration of the business. Three years ago, their associate decided to invest in a different activity and sold his stake for them to continue with the store. \r\n\r\nAt present, their business provides them with what they need to support their home. They also earn commissions from motorcycle sales, which her husband is responsible for. Their business is mostly known for their good relationship with their surroundings, customers, and suppliers. As their clientele has grown, they have found their working capital to be insufficient. This is the reason why they have requested a credit, their first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. The loan will be used to buy tires, inner tubes of tires, and luxury accessories. She finds that these products have the highest turnover and she needs additional inventory to effectively meet her customers' demand.\r\n\r\nThe strength of this business lies in its strategic location, which can potentially increase their sales since it lies in principal avenue of the San Juan Nepomuceno municipality in the department of Bolivar.\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1039102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy tires, inner tubes of tires, and luxury accessories which are the products with highest turnover.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Juan Nepomuceno-Bolivar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-21T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-20T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madeleine Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116819},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":123628},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":126512},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":129464},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":132485},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":135577},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":138740},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146775}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.98},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.75,"local_amount":116819,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":117887.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651509,"comment":null},{"amount":70.65,"local_amount":123628,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":124758.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141125,"comment":null},{"amount":72.29,"local_amount":126512,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":127668.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101006,"comment":null},{"amount":73.98,"local_amount":129464,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":130647.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338626,"comment":null},{"amount":75.71,"local_amount":132485,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:22Z","rounded_local_amount":133696.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395191,"comment":null},{"amount":77.47,"local_amount":135577,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:39Z","rounded_local_amount":136816.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774999,"comment":null},{"amount":79.28,"local_amount":138740,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":140008.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386993,"comment":null},{"amount":83.87,"local_amount":146775,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":148116.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993855,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T13:29:00Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":405313,"name":"Arcelie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arcelie is 28 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is on her first individual loan that she intends to use to buy two lengths of <i>riche<i\/> damask cloth. She gets her supplies from Bamako and accepts cash from a mixed customer base in general. She exports to Senegal in particular. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions making a monthly profit of 250,000 francs CFA. This profit will enable her to repay her loan and to run other revenue-generating businesses.

She plans to use the profit from her business to improve\/expand her enterprise.<p>\r\n\r\nMost of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Selepa's first loan with SPBD.

Suanepa is requesting a loan of 2,000 WST in order to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make products to sell.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 WST or $167 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Suanepa joined SPBD in order to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Suanepa's third loan with SPBD.
