Margaret will use the loan to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar, and soap for resale, and will help her to generate greater profits. She hopes that in the future she will be able to buy cows and build a house. \r\n\r\nMargret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

Then she takes charge of arranging them by species and sizes.  Finally, she sells them by the kilo, and she often triples her initial investment.\r\n\r\nHer customers are prospective buyers and fish merchants from the city.  Her primary tool is her great charisma and her eloquence in gaining access to the customers.

Le gustan ambas actividades que realiza, ya que la mantiene ocupada, lo que no le agrada, seg\u00fan comenta, es que algunas veces no ha logrado pescar lo suficiente para cubrir los gastos, muchas veces debido a la escasez de los peces o a la creciente de los r\u00edos, pero eso no la desanima.\n\nEste es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por tanto agradece a quienes lo hacen posible.

She is a happy, friendly woman with a lot of business experience. Her partner Dennis, 54, is a fisherman. She lives with her parents, her partner and her two children, who are 19 and 16 years old. They live in a house that she, with the support of her partner, succeeded in building after many years of working.\r\n\r\nCarmen\u2019s business involves the sale of fish. She has a fishing boat which she takes to a river or lake, together with her partner and two helpers as well as all the fishing gear they need to do good work. Later she sells the catch, wholesale, to a market in the city.  She has been doing this work for 20 years. Moreover, she has discovered in this routine an opportunity to sell second hand clothing because in the surrounding areas adjacent to the rivers where she fishes, the settlers ask her for garments. She buys clothing in commercial centers in the city and then sells it at each village she visits. She has had this business for two years.  She enjoys both businesses since they keep her busy. However what she does not like, she says, is that sometimes she fails to catch enough to cover expenses, often due to a lack of fish or the rising rivers, but that does not discourage her.\r\n\r\nThis is Carmen\u2019s second loan from MFP, therefore she is grateful to those who make it possible. She is very committed, one more time, to making her payments on time and she is very happy to belong to her communal bank because all the members are very good, friendly and supportive people.\r\n\r\nWith the sum requested, (S\/. 1,200), she will by nets to continue fishing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1119771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase fishing nets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":187.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":181.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":197.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":205.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":208.74},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":219.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.23},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.94},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.23,"local_amount":187.28,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":187.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099040,"comment":null},{"amount":68.03,"local_amount":181.4,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":181.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401972,"comment":null},{"amount":74.17,"local_amount":197.79,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":197.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456247,"comment":null},{"amount":76.94,"local_amount":205.17,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":205.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451911,"comment":null},{"amount":78.27,"local_amount":208.74,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":208.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447086,"comment":null},{"amount":82.36,"local_amount":219.62,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":219.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052992,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-21T15:34:58Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":439400,"name":"Ablavi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ablavi est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9(e) de 35 ans.

She lives with her family in their own house, which she built with her partner in her mother-in-law's land. She works very hard on a daily basis to give the best of herself for her children to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHer business is to sell food (grilled meat, french fries with sausage, among others) during the night on the sidewalk of her house. She has been in this business for three years, which allows her to earn an income for her home. She used to sell fruits, but she stopped because it was not providing the expected earnings. In the worst case scenario, she had to wait for the money her partner earned as a carpenter, which was not enough to cover all of the household expenses. She really enjoys what she does, since she has always liked to cook. She has many plans for her business, but for the time being, only wants to gather enough capital to expand it.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth credit with Microfinanzas Prisma (MFI).

tiene 44 a\u00f1os, es una mujer emprendedora, alegre y sobre todo muy trabajadora. Se encuentra separada hace muchos a\u00f1os de quien fue su pareja, con la que tuvo cuatro hijos, siendo dos de ellos ya mayores de edad. Vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus dos menores hijos en la casa que le dej\u00f3 su ex pareja. \n\nSu actividad es la venta de abarrotes en general y bebidas, para eso estableci\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a bodega en su vivienda, ah\u00ed atiende todos los d\u00edas, desde muy temprano, de manera amable y cordial a todos sus clientes, que en su mayor\u00eda son sus vecinos, con quienes tiene una relaci\u00f3n de amistad y respeto durante los 6 a\u00f1os que viene funcionando su bodega. Generalmente atiende sola, pero en ocasiones recibe la ayuda de su hija. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n desde hace un a\u00f1o trabaja por las noches en la atenci\u00f3n al p\u00fablico en un restaurante de su ciudad, ambos trabajos le generan los ingresos necesarios para poder llevar una vida confortable para ella y sus hijos.

She has been separated for many years from the father of her four children, two of whom are already adults. She lives with her two younger children in the house that her ex-husband left her.\r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of groceries and drinks, for which she established a small shop in her residence. Starting very early, she helps all her customers there every day in a friendly and cordial way. For the most part, her customers are her neighbors, with whom she has had a friendly and respectful relationship for the six years that her store has been in business. She generally works alone, but on occasion her daughter helps her. For the past year, she has also worked evenings serving the public in a restaurant in her city. Both jobs generate the income necessary to be able to provide a comfortable life for herself and her children. She enjoys her grocery-selling business because it allows her to be at home during the day and to participate in the school and household activities of her daughter. Also, the income she makes helps cover basic costs, since the support payments she receives every month from her ex-husband weren't covering all the family's expenses. That's why she decided to work rather than continue doing without. Seeing the good results that she has had to date, she has plans to continue with her business and expand and improve her little store.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan with MFP and Sonia is very happy to know that she has financial support; that way she will feel more sure of continuing with her work. She also commits, once again, to repaying her loan punctually like she did before. In addition, she is very happy to belong to her communal bank, since all the members are very responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount (1000 PEN), Sonia will purchase a greater quantity of different products and groceries in order to offer a better selection to her customers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1119687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase merchandise for her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T22:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":155.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":151.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":164.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":173.86},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":183.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.16,"local_amount":307.08,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":307.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401971,"comment":null},{"amount":61.77,"local_amount":164.74,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":164.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456246,"comment":null},{"amount":64.09,"local_amount":170.89,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":170.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451910,"comment":null},{"amount":65.19,"local_amount":173.86,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":173.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447085,"comment":null},{"amount":68.79,"local_amount":183.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":183.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052991,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-09T19:53:53Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438974,"name":"Mar\u00eda Herminia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Herminia tiene 67 a\u00f1os de edad, es viuda y no tiene hijos a su cargo.

is from the village of Ude in the southern part of Georgia. She is 56 years old and lives with her husband Peter and 87-year-old mother-in-law. Tamar and Peter have children, but they are married and live separately. Tamar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her sales business start-up but had no success. Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTamar and Peter have a milk cow. Tamar produces cheese and sells it in the village. Peter also grows potatoes on the family-owned 0.6 hectare land. He sells the harvest to local wholesalers. The family's total average monthly income is 350 Laris. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTamar has requested credit for starting up a sales business. The family owns an old small truck, which Tamar and Peter will use for the business. With the requested credit, Tamar will purchase seasonal fruits and vegetables from local farmers and take them with the truck to nearby towns for sale. Tamar will sell the products with a price mark-up and get the profit. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. As a result of the new business initiative, implemented with the assistance of Kiva, the family will get more income. Tamar will be able to assist her children financially and improve her family's living conditions. She plans to increase the volume of trade gradually by reinvesting part of the profit into business.

She is separated from the person who was her partner for a very long time.  She has three young children from that relationship for whom she works herself to death to be able to give them the best.  She lives with them in the house she inherited from her parents. \r\n\r\nShe set up a space in her house for her business that serves as a sewing studio.  She sews different kinds of dresses, blouses, pants for women and for men, lingerie, and suits for special occasions.  She is very detail-oriented and she is able to express this in her garments, which is reflected in her customers' satisfaction.  She has been in this business for almost 15 years and she has always worked alone.  She has also included the sale of drinks (beer and sodas) into her business.  She started this part of her business one year ago, also out of her home.  She loves the sewing work she does, though she had problems initially because she did not make garments to her clientele's taste.  However, now she is like a stylist who always has suggestions for her customers.  This allows her to handle her business well and she is always able to please her customers.  Nevertheless, even though she makes what they like and she makes money from it, she still wants to grow her beverages business little by little as, in the future, she hopes to set up a small bar and thereby solidify another source of income for her family's well-being.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP and she is thankful for the opportunity they are offering her and the confidence they have in her.  She promises to make her payments on time and she is also happy to be a part of her communal bank, as she sees that its members are responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1,000 nuevos soles to buy some fabrics and thread to keep working in sewing.  She will also invest part of the money in the purchase of more beers and sodas.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1119781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy sewing materials and to buy beverages to sell\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T23:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T23:00:11Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":154.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":151.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":164.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":171.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":174.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":183.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.07,"local_amount":154.86,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":154.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099043,"comment":null},{"amount":56.72,"local_amount":151.25,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401978,"comment":null},{"amount":61.85,"local_amount":164.92,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":165.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456253,"comment":null},{"amount":64.15,"local_amount":171.07,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":171.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451917,"comment":null},{"amount":65.27,"local_amount":174.06,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":174.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447092,"comment":null},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":183.84,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":183.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052998,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-21T08:24:17Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":440028,"name":"Anastase","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anastase, 33, is married with five children ages 2 to 13, and he takes care of eight relatives.

Annet is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fort portal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children who are all currently in school. For the past three years, Annet has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Annet has requested a loan of  700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Annet generate greater profits to pay school fees for her children. Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house on it. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Annet's future prospects by helping her to learn how to budget.

These teachers have applied for a loan of 14,500,000 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) from SMT\/Kiva lenders. This will be the first loan this group of teachers will be accessing from Kiva lenders. School staff from this institution, like many other school staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, comes to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

Her main difficulty is that her customers sometimes pay on credit.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting her fourth loan from WAGES for the purchase of damask fabrics, \"pagnes\" and sewing supplies.\r\n\r\nIn the coming years, she would like to be able to visit wholesalers in order to choose and order damask fabrics directly from them.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 15,000. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCorazon dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Ochirbat, 26, works in the steel factory which is in Darkhan, the second largest city.

He believes it will increase his family income notably.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the smoky and extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars on the natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Ochirbat is taking will be used to cover the cost of his buying a car which uses natural gas.

Meanwhile, Tabitha can earn extra money. \r\n\r\nThe lack of working capital is her biggest challenge, this is why she has turned to Kiva for her sixth loan with Yehu Microfinance Trust.

For the past two years, Jolly has been working hard to manage her small hotel, which sells cooked food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jolly has requested a loan of 500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food for cooking, and will help Jolly to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Jolly hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build on it. \r\n\r\nJolly is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Jolly's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

Solongo, 22, lives with her husband and 2-year-old child in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic yurt. They live on her father-in-law\u2019s land in Ulaanbaatar, the capital. They are a young couple who have recently started living separately from their parents. Solongo is a young, energetic woman with a desire to create new and big things. Her husband is a taxi driver. She has been working in a small company as an architect for one year, and has gained a lot of experience. Mongolia is a rapidly developing country in Asia; the proof is skyscraping cranes located everywhere in Ulaanbaatar. Construction projects are promising a huge profit and dozens of companies are building apartments. Solongo doesn\u2019t have enough time for her family, because the company where she works has plenty of work to be done. For this reason, she works at the company from morning till night. Solongo is requesting a 1,500,000 MNT loan to purchase a PC with new software so she can do some of her work at home. This will enable her to spend more time with her family. In the future, she wants to own her own architecture company, and the PC will help her reach her goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1122121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"To purchase a PC ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-06-21T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-21T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solongo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":231350},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":236495.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":245537.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":253954.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":265948.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":266714.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":203.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":177.37,"local_amount":231350,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":233594.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294313345,"comment":null},{"amount":181.31,"local_amount":236495.28,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":238789.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301369445,"comment":null},{"amount":382.94,"local_amount":499492.11,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":504337.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308129214,"comment":null},{"amount":408.38,"local_amount":532662.61,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":537829.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315365090,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-21T20:00:51Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:36:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":440418,"name":"Shazia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shazia is married and 30 years of age.

Even though Tang recently received financial support from her children, she doesn't completely depend on her children. Tang, at her age, still works hard to generate income for herself.

While his mother spends her time as a homemaker, Alex works seven hours each day on his property.  In his free time, he enjoys playing soccer with his son.  He strives each day to help his family move forward.  The most difficult part of his job is cleaning the areas where the pigs are housed because he must perform all of the work by himself.

is a-34-year-old widower who lives alone in an outer ger district of Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia. (A 'ger' is a traditional Mongolian tent.) The district lacks basic infrastructure. He is a teacher at a local college. \r\n\r\nRecently he moved from his old location to a new yard and is building a dormitory with 9 rooms. Besides his teaching job he is building the dormitory by himself. This shows that he is a very hardworking and ambitious man.  \r\n\r\nHe has already finished 4 rooms and wishes to finish the last 5 as quickly. Therefore he is requesting a 3,000,000 MNT (Mongolian Tugriks) loan to purchase essential construction materials to finish his dormitory in order to rent to others who want to rent.  Plus his current yard and dormitory is located in a very good place, so he is happy for it. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1743.88,"image":{"id":1122165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy essential construction materials in order to finish a dormitory.

She currently lives in a home that she purchased after many years of setting aside daily savings.  Zoila lives with her entire family and together they strive each day to achieve financial success and the fulfillment of their dreams.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer business involves selling fast food and traditional dishes of the region (such as roasted meats and plantains).  Every day, in the early hours of the morning, she heads out to the market in the city in order to buy all of the ingredients that she needs for preparing her dishes, which are sold from the sidewalk in front of her house beginning at 4pm.  Her kitchen is equipped with a slow-burning fire pit for roasting the meat.  She also has two tables set up, one for displaying all of her dishes and the other with four chairs for seating her guests.  The exceptional flavor of her dishes makes her food stand a necessary stop for customers who want to satisfy their hunger.  Zoila has been in this line of work for four years and has had the help and constant support of her daughter from the very beginning.  Both of them work nonstop.  On an occasional basis, Zoila also sells clothing in the remote areas of the city.  She has been doing this for eight months.  What she enjoys about her job is being able to stay at home since she does not have to travel to another place to generate sales.  She appreciates being able to generate her own income by doing something that she enjoys, which is cooking.  Going forward, she hopes to establish a restaurant where she can better serve her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 11th loan with MFP.  Zoila is grateful for this opportunity and the trust that has been demonstrated to her once again.  She promises to complete her payments on time and appreciates being part of her Communal Bank, where all of the members are responsible and supportive individuals.  The loan amount of 2,500 PEN that she requested will be used to buy the necessary ingredients for continuing her business.  She will also buy a few articles of clothing for her other business.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1119790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for her food business and a few articles for her clothing business.

31, lives in Baray district of Kompong Tom province with her husband and four school-aged children. She is in the rice farming business, selling fresh fish and at the same time fattening hogs to sell for additional income.

She currently manages a neighborhood store and has been in this line of work for several years.  The loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying sugar, rice, and oil.  These items will be purchased at the traditional fairs in El Alto and later sold at her retail shop.  Working in this manner helps her family get ahead.  Yola is single and has two children.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Yola said that she enjoys the savings.  In the photo, there is one member who is hidden and only part of her head can be seen.  This member is Sra. Haidy, who is fearful of the camera, but she did not want to be separated from the group.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":1120349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy sugar, rice, and oil.

Negro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Monte Negro est\u00e1 integrado por cinco personas originarias de la comunidad de Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca donde la mayor\u00eda de las personas habla el idioma mixteco.\n\nUno de los integrantes del grupo es el se\u00f1or Florentino de cuarenta y tres a\u00f1os de edad, quien se dedica a trabajar su taxi el cual  pertenece a un sitio llamado Kasandoo ubicado en su localidad. Florentino explica que la palabra \"Kasandoo\" significa \u201ccasa de adobe\u201d en mixteco. \u00c9l lleva trabajando como taxista tres a\u00f1os, y para \u00e9l, han sido los mejores a\u00f1os que ha tenido ya que hace lo que le gusta: ayudar a las personas ofreciendo su servicio o dando un avent\u00f3n a quienes en verdad lo necesitan. Con el objetivo de seguir brindando un buen servicio, Florentino pidi\u00f3 un cr\u00e9dito para darle mantenimiento a su taxi. \n\nPara Don Florentino, una de las mejores experiencias que ha tenido como taxista fue cuando subi\u00f3 a una persona a su taxi y la llev\u00f3 a su destino aunque esta no ten\u00eda dinero para pagar; despu\u00e9s de tiempo, se encontr\u00f3 a la misma persona, exactamente cuando \u00e9l necesitaba a alguien para platicar asuntos personales. Debido a la confianza que gener\u00f3 lo sucedido en el primer encuentro, Don Florentino se sinti\u00f3 c\u00f3modo platicando lo que le suced\u00eda entonces. \n\nDe acuerdo con sus propias palabras, una de las caracter\u00edsticas que debe tener una persona para ser taxista es, m\u00e1s que nada, ser honesto ya que ocasiones los pasajeros dejan cosas de valor olvidadas en el taxi y es el momento perfecto donde uno puede practicar sus valores. Don Florentino dice que se considera una persona especial porque le gusta enfrentar las dificultades, ya que desde muy peque\u00f1o ha sabido c\u00f3mo ganarse el pan de cada d\u00eda y lo que cuesta hacerlo pues sus padres son personas son personas de bajos recursos. Adem\u00e1s, en la visita realizada a Florentino, tambi\u00e9n quiso compartir una frase con la que se identifica demasiado: \u201cEn lugar de ser un hombre de \u00e9xito, busca ser un hombre valioso: lo dem\u00e1s llegar\u00e1 naturalmente.\u201d \n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son:\n\nFelipe - se dedica a la venta de antojitos mexicanos.\nH\u00e9ctor Manuel - se dedica a la venta de comida.\nFloriberta - se dedica a la venta  de comida.\nRosa - se dedica a la venta de antojitos mexicanos.\n\nLe dan las gracias a Vision Fund por ayudar a hombres y mujeres trabajadoras.\n\n\n ","en":"The Monte Negro group is made up of five people from the community of Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca, where most people speak the Mixtec language.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is the 40-year-old Florentino, who works driving a taxi in a place called Kasandoo, located in his area. Florentino explains that the word \"Kasandoo\" means \"adobe house\" in Mixtec. He has worked as a taxi driver for three years, and for him, they have been the best years of his life. Now, he can do what he enjoys: help people by offering his services or giving a ride to those who really need it. With the goal of continuing his good service, Florentino is asking for a loan for maintenance on his taxi.\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Florentino, one of the best experiences that he has had as a taxi driver was when he picked up a person in his taxi and brought them to their destination even though they didn't have the money to pay him. After a while, he encountered the same person exactly when he needed to talk to somebody about personal matters. Thanks to the trust created by what happened in the first encounter, Mr. Florentino felt comfortable talking about what happened then.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own words, one of the characteristics that a person should have in order to be a taxi driver is, more than anything, honesty. On occasion, passengers leave valuable things forgotten in the taxi and it's the perfect time for one to practice his\/her virtues. Mr. Florentino says that he considers himself to be a special person because he likes to face difficulties. Since he was a small child, he has known how to earn his daily bread. It was difficult to do because his parents were people of few resources. In addition, in Florentino's visit, he wanted to share a phrase with which he greatly identifies: \"In place of being a successful man, try to be a valuable man. The rest will come naturally.\"\r\n\r\nThe other members in the group are:\r\n\r\nFelipe - works selling traditional corn-based Mexican dishes\r\nHector Manuel - works selling food\r\nFloriberta - works selling food\r\nRosa - works selling traditional corn-based Mexican dishes\r\n\r\nThey give their thanks to Vision Fund for helping working men and women.\r\n\r\n

One of the things she most likes about her business is waiting on customers, which she always does graciously and with a smile.\n\nSome of the kinds of flowers Nancy sells are gladiolas, lilies, the eternal rose and other varieties. She notes that those she sells most are chrysanthemums and roses. She says the characteristics she needs to do her work are creativity and patience in making her floral arrangements, as well as intelligence in choosing the most appropriate flowers for each type of occasion. In addition, Nancy mentions that she considers herself a rather special person because she always likes to be one of the best at her work, thus the competition does not affect her much.

Para Raquel, una de las caracter\u00edsticas que debe tener para realizar ventas por cat\u00e1log es ser responsable, amable, tener poder de convencimiento y, sobre todo, ser activa. Adem\u00e1s, dice que se considera una persona especial por enfrentar los problemas con valent\u00eda y por el hecho de que no se deja vencer tan f\u00e1cilmente. Raquel pidi\u00f3 su cr\u00e9dito para comprar m\u00e1s moldes de pl\u00e1stico para la venta ya que los paquetes que compra le cuestan aproximadamente dos mil cuatrocientos pesos; de esta forma podr\u00e1 tener ejemplares para mostrar y ayudar a convencer a los clientes. \n\nLas otras integrantes del grupo son:\nAdelfa - se dedica a la venta de pan.\nMar\u00eda Adelfa- se dedica a la venta de antojitos mexicanos.\nIdolina- se dedica a la venta de quesos.\nGaudencia- se dedica a la venta de mercanc\u00eda de abarrotes.\nElizabeth- se dedica a la venta de comida.\nLuc\u00eda- se dedica a la venta de pan.\nSoledad- se dedica a la venta de quesos.\nRaquel- se dedica a la venta de refrescos.\nCatalina- se dedica a la venta de ropa.\nAna Mar\u00eda- se dedica a la venta de mercanc\u00eda de abarrotes.\nRosa-se dedica a la venta de ropa.\nCristina- se dedica a la venta de pl\u00e1sticos.\nAdriana- se dedica a la venta de pan.\n\nTodas ellas le dan las gracias a Vision Fund por ayudarlas a invertir en su negocio y aprovechar mejor sus ganancias.\n\n","en":"This group is named The Jamiltepec Gardenias, it is made up of fourteen indigenous women originally from the state of Oaxaca called Santiago Jamiltepec, a land rich in traditions.\r\n\r\n<p>One of the members of this group is Mrs. Luisa Raquel, better known as Do\u00f1a Raquel, she is 52 years old. Do\u00f1a Raquel has sold plastic molds by catalogue for some 7 years, she is a street vendor. One of the things she enjoys most about her work is very good profits since she buys the products from the distributor and gets up to a 30% discount. Do\u00f1a Raquel started this job thanks to her friend, Cecilia, who invited her to sell items by catalogue since it is a way for her to manage her own time without neglecting her daughter.\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most challenging experiences that Do\u00f1a Raquel has faced is her daughters\u2019 illness. Claudia is 25 years old and is mentally challenged. Do\u00f1a Raquel mentions that her daughter is the motor that drives her to get ahead in life and to face all of her obstacles. For Raquel, one of the characteristics that she has to have for her work is to be a responsible, kind, knowledgeable, and overall active person. She considers herself to be a special person since she faces her problems with courage and does not give up easily. Raquel needs the loan to buy more plastic molds to sell since the packages that she buys cost about twenty-four hundred pesos, she will then have examples to show and which will help her convince customers to buy her products.\r\n\r\n<p>The other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nAdelfa - sells bread\r\nMar\u00eda Adelfa- sells Mexican treats.\r\nIdolina- sells cheese.\r\nGaudencia- sells groceries.\r\nElizabeth- sells food.\r\nLuc\u00eda- sells bread.\r\nSoledad- sells cheese.\r\nRaquel- sells refreshments.\r\nCatalina- sells clothing.\r\nAna Mar\u00eda- sells groceries.\r\nRosa-

48-year-old Hawa from Moriba town in the southern area of Bo. She is widowed with 2 children aged 10 years and 23 years. Her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Hawa established her Table business (selling local foodstuffs). She sells raw rice, pepper, Maggi food products, salt and palm oil. She started her business because she is a single parent and wants to generate income to support her family. \r\n\r\nShe works 10 hours a day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge in her business is that when there are fewer sales, some perishable goods will deteriorate and the business will run at a loss.\r\n\r\nHawa requires a loan in order to buy more local foodstuffs like raw rice, palm oil, Maggi, pepper and tomato seeds. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. In the future, Hawa plans to expand her business to a higher level. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1121267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Four of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nElizabeth runs a business selling wood and charcoal. She has been running this business for 2 years. She works 13 hours a day and 7 days per week. Her husband is a village pastor, and he helps her support the family with the money he receives from the church. \r\n\r\nElizabeth says that the main challenges in her business are that transportation costs are high and the road network is poor.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has requested a loan in order to buy more bags of charcoal and wood to store, because during the rainy season charcoal will be scarce. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her standard of living and give her children a good quality education. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to expand her business and build a house. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1121227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

For the past ten years, she has run a general store where she sells soft drinks, water, and batteries. Abibatu began this business because, after working with an NGO supporting malnourished children, she decided to start a business. She works 12 hours a day seven days a week and her husband also earns an income. Abibatu's main business challenge is the scarcity of soft drinks.\r\n\r\nAbibatu is requesting a loan to buy food stuff such as water, soft drinks, and provisions. The extra income from her loan will allow her to educate her children and renovate her house. In the future, she plans to open a bigger shop to sell more items. Abibatu appreciates your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1121126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

from Sierra Leone! This is 50-year-old Margaret from Torkpoi town. She is married with four children between the ages of 28 and 35. For the past 15 years, Margaret has been running a general store inside the market square where she sells dried fish, pepper, bullion cubes, onions, and tomatoes. She began this business to create a permanent source of income to support her family. Margaret buys goods from a wholesaler at 4:00 am and works at her store from 8:00 am through 4:00 pm six days a week. Her major business challenge is transportation to buy fish.\r\n\r\nMargaret is requesting a loan to buy more fish, bullion, and pepper. The extra income from her loan will allow her to start a savings account. In the future, Margaret plans to expand her business and improve her standard of living. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1121288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

in Patzicia, a community within Chimaltenango, Guatemala. \r\n\r\nTo support her family, Feliza and her children cultivate vegetables that she brings to the local market to sell.\r\n \r\nBefore having her own business, Feliza worked in other people's houses washing their clothes. Now she is very happy to run her own small business.\r\n\r\nFeliza leaves her house very early in the morning to work in her fields, carrying her one-year old daughter on her back. Later in the morning she sells her vegetables. Feliza, who has had no formal education, believes that with a successful business, she will be able to support her children and provide them with a bright future.\r\n \r\nFeliza has successfully completed her first loan with Friendship Bridge, a loan that helped her to continue running her business, as well as pay for household expenses and her children\u2019s needs. Now Feliza is applying for her second loan, which she plans to use to buy vegetables in bulk, which will allow her to expand her business further. Feliza\u2019s short-term dream is to devote herself to her vegetable business and provide a stable home for her children, allowing them to go to school.\r\n\r\nFeliza\u2019s Trust Bank, Las Margaritas Patzicia, is composed of eight women, most of whom are engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Together, they participate in monthly educational lessons on business, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, health and how to support their children\u2019s education. These lessons, combined with their loans, help them to provide a better life for themselves and their families. The women of Las Margaritas Patzicia are grateful for the people who trust in them, enabling them to obtain loans for their businesses and overcome the poverty that surrounds them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":1121319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nDelia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. \r\n\r\nHer regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nDelia hopes to be able to expand the business soon. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.
