young and optimistic 27 year old woman.

From childhood, Bunafsha dreamed of becoming a teacher and after graduating from high school, she attended teacher's college and continued her education. She currently works as a Russian language teacher at a local school. Bunafsha's husband works as a lawyer. He also studied his profession at university and successfully completed his education, receiving a college degree. \r\n\r\nBunafsha and her husband strive to do all that they can to provide their children with everything they need. Their combined earnings are enough for an average household. However, until now, they have insufficient funds to cover all of their existing needs. Currently, Bunafsha and her husband want to buy a car. They have dreamt of it for some time now, as having a car would make getting around much easier for them. In order to buy a car, Bunasha needs a large sum of money. For this reason, she approached Arvand to take out a loan to buy a car.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of seven children, three sons and four daughters. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. For the past many days his rickshaw has not been working properly as a result of which he is unable to generate any amount of income. Due to this he is facing serious financial problems as he is unable to meet the household expenses. \r\n\r\nHe wants to repair the rickshaw as soon as possible. However due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing it. Therefore Bushra, as a member of a two-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband pay for the maintenance of the rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

She has five years of experience in her tortilla business. She learned about this business on her own. Due to a lack of employment in the country and the fact that she has no professional studies, she decided to start selling tortillas.\r\n\r\nShe currently makes fruit-flavored milkshakes, popsicles, and chocolate bananas for children. She cooks corn in the mornings, and at 2:00 p.m. she grinds it in a mill. Later, she returns home to prepare the flour, pork rind, and cheese to start making her tortillas. This takes her until 8:00 p.m. Clients can sit in and eat in her business or they can buy take-away food.\r\n\r\nTo buy products, she has to travel to the city by bus for 25 minutes. When she arrives, she buys ingredients in a wholesale store.

Elizabeth's work is selling soft drinks to the general public, in various brands and flavors. She also sells clothing for children and adolescents. She recently established her small business in the place where she lives now, but she has dedicated herself to this work for about 9 years. She occasionally offers her products from house to house, or while visiting her family members and friends. She has always worked alone, because she feels more comfortable this way; she believes that in this way she can stay organized, and she doesn't have any pressure at the time that she is serving her customers. She feels very happy because she knows that all of the work she does produces the income she needs to cover her household's basic expenses. However, she knows that she needs to continue making a great effort to improve this situation. She hopes to keep working so that she can expand her business even more, and in the future to buy a plot of land to build her home. On this occasion, she is requesting 4000 Peruvian soles. She is very moved to know that there are people who are giving her economic support to continue carrying out her work, and accordingly she is committed to making her payments punctually. With the requested amount, she will buy a greater quantity of soft drinks in various brands and flavors."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1187.87,"image":{"id":1387041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy various brands and flavors of soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-07-23T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-22T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":613.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":636.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":633.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":683.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":709.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":723.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":453.09,"local_amount":1249.9,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1256.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864904,"comment":null},{"amount":229.82,"local_amount":633.98,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":637.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353270,"comment":null},{"amount":247.86,"local_amount":683.75,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":687.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905037,"comment":null},{"amount":257.1,"local_amount":709.25,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-26T09:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":713.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091037,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T10:30:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585552,"name":"Rosedelma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosedelma is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a bakery business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 19500 through NWTF to purchase ingredients like flour, salt, sugar, yeast, etc. for her bread production business.\r\n\r\nRosedelma has been in this business for 27 years.

The lady sitting in the middle with raised hand is Banita. She lives with her five-member family consisting of her husband and three daughters of 9, 6 and 3 years of age. Her two elder daughters are continuing study in school. She has a very shy nature and always devotes her efforts to getting her family ahead. \r\n\r\nFor the last five years, Banita has been running a general grocery shop in her house. Initially she started the business in a low profile with limited items like potatoes, soap, sugar, tea dust, tobacco, chocolates, etc. Gradually she expanded her business and added extra items regularly. \r\n\r\nDue to her good behavior, her business has gradually grown and become established. This year, Banita joined a group of her village named Sai Ram with the existing four members to avail loans from Mahashakti Foundation for expanding her existing business. All members of this group hail from poor backgrounds in the below poverty line category. \r\n\r\nNow Banita is earning 100\/200 INR daily from her business. Banita wants to keep more stock for her shop but, due to financial scarcity, she is not able to this. So from this first loan from Mahashakti Foundation, she has planned to buy merchandise for her business such as sugar, vegetables, oil, noodles, potatoes, onions, dough, etc. in bulk. She expects to increase her sales and thereby her income, which will serve to ensure the education and welfare of her children. \r\n\r\nBanita hopes to build a permanent cabin in the center of her village for running her business. She also hopes to provide better education to her children.\r\n \r\nThe other four members of the group are Latika, Premsila, Sundari and Kalpana, who are running a spice business, a shop and washing powder vending business, a vegetable vending business and a vegetable cultivation business, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1392353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for purchasing sugar, vegetables, oil, noodles, potatoes, onions, dough, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BARPADAR, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-23T13:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-22T13:20:23Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalpana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sundari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premsila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Latika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":62000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":62000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T18:57:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585565,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene is 44 years old and married.

She has worked all her life as a street vendor selling clothes, which means she has to go from house to house in various communities to offer the clothing she has for sale. This is how she has brought up her 2 children. She also has 2 sewing machines on which she makes sheets, pillowslips and other garments which people ask her for. Her parents were unable to send her to school and for this reason she has never been able to have a formal or decent job. That is why she found selling clothing as a street vendor was her only way of making an income. She has to walk all day to offer her clothing to as many people as possible. Sometimes she has to leave items on credit and return later to collect what she is owed, although this is risky as sometimes people do not pay her.\r\n\r\nTo buy her stock she has to travel to the city, which is a 10 minute journey away by bus. In the city she makes her purchases and then returns home to prepare the stock for sale before going out to sell.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will be used to buy various amounts of clothing for men, women and children and also to invest in some items with which she wants to improve her home.\r\n\r\nIn this way she will have a very varied range of clothing and will increase her stock with the aim of satisfying her customers, since she will be able to take them the sort of clothing they like.

To-date, she was able to grow her farming business and has a livestock farm.  Her farm contains two dairy cows, ten sheep and five goats.  She also has 2.50 hectares of irrigated land, where she annually grows barley and hay.  In order to further develop her livestock farm and farming business, Nuruyla requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep.

His rickshaw is not working properly, and because of that he is unable to generate income. He wants to repair the rickshaw as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the repair cost.

The only source of income for the family is a small amount earned by Paata serving the locals as a taxi driver with his car. Several days ago he had an accident, and unfortunately his taxi was smashed. Paata was uninsured and now is requesting credit to fix the car.\r\n\r\nHis request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative of Kiva and MFO, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.

He knows all of the nuances of animal husbandry.  He is involved in fattening up and breeding livestock.  Rustamjon has four cows and seven rams.  His wife milks the cows and gets fresh and delicious milk.  She receives an income by selling milk and spends it on the daily expenses for her children.  Because Rustamjon receives a seasonal income from livestock, he is also involved in beekeeping and obtains and stores quality honey.  He finds money for supporting the family by selling honey all-year-around.  Currently, his livestock feed ran out.  He also wants to repair his cowshed and prepare for the fall season.  He needs an additional amount of money for this.  Having learned about the services of MDO \"Arvand,\" he decided to obtain a loan and realize his plans.  He hopes for support from \"Arvand\" very much and thanks in advance for the assistance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":556.36,"image":{"id":1391308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

The existing income is only enough to cover everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nSo, Nargiz decided to start up a grocery store to increase the family income, but she needs financial support to implement her plan. Unfortunately, Nargiz lacks the access to financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, as these financial institutions require a stable income and business experience.

Mavlon has been selling men's clothing for 22 years and increased his finances by several times.  He has many clients, and this is why he is very proud of his business.  His son now has a young family, and his expenses are increasing annually.  This is why Mavlon wants to give half of the business to his son.  He wants his son to start and grow his own business as well.  At the present time, Mavlon wants to expand his business and buy a new selection of men's clothing.

is a 29-year-old, married woman; she has been engaged in a business of milk sales for the past two years.

Luis ahora vive en el Pacto una parroquia del Cant\u00f3n Quito ubicado en la Provincia de Pichincha en la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Pacto est\u00e1 ubicado en el noroccidente del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, su historia inicia en la \u00e9poca preincaica y su nombre se deriva de acuerdos realizados entre partidos pol\u00edticos importantes. En cuanto a su econom\u00eda, es una zona agr\u00edcola y ganadera, debido a su situaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica y geogr\u00e1fica, lo cual tambi\u00e9n produce efecto en las cosechas de las cuales se obtiene productos de la Regi\u00f3n Costa como de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra. Su gente vive al d\u00eda a d\u00eda de estas actividades, aunque es un lugar alejado de la ciudad, existen familias que han emprendido en todo tipo de actividades para cubrir sus necesidades y las de su comunidad. \nLuis desde hace 20 a\u00f1os se dedica a la siembra, cosecha, tratado y venta de la ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar y sus derivados, actividad que la aprendi\u00f3 cuando era empleado particular y luego ya con la experiencia necesaria, se independiz\u00f3 y \u00e9ste ha sido el sustento para su familia durante todos estos a\u00f1os, es por esto que invierte al menos 9 horas cada d\u00eda y Luis comenta que una de las tareas m\u00e1s complicadas es cortar los troncos de la planta porque son muy s\u00f3lidos, esta actividad la realiza en un terreno que es alquilado pero \u00e9l sue\u00f1a con un d\u00eda poder tener su propia finca para as\u00ed ofrecer a su familia un mejor estilo de vida. Es por esto que para cumplir este sue\u00f1o Luis es consciente de que debe trabajar duro y cada d\u00eda mejorar su labor, para lo cual solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en reparar y dar mantenimiento a la maquinaria que posee con la cual extrae el jugo de la ca\u00f1a con el que luego se elabora el az\u00facar y algunos derivados extras.

","en":"Luis is a 48-year old man.  He was born in Colombia, but he left in search of opportunities and personal security.  He is married to 41-year old Amalia, who focuses on household chores and the care of their 9- and 12-year old children.  Luis now lives in Pacto, a parish of the Quito canton, situated in the province of Pichincha in the Republic of Ecuador.  \r\n\r\nPacto is situated in the northwest of the Metropolitan District of Quito.  Its history begins in the pre-Incan period, and its name is derived from the agreements made between important political parties.  In terms of its economy, it is a farming and cattle raising region because of its climatic and geographic situation, which also have an effect on the harvests from which produce is obtained from the Costa region as well as the Sierra region.\r\n\r\nIts people live day to day from these activities.  Although it is far from the city, there are families who have undertaken all types of businesses to meet their needs and those of their community.\r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years, Luis has made his living planting, harvesting, processing and selling sugarcane and its derivatives, a business he learned when he was a private employee.  Later, with the necessary experience, he broke away, and this has been the daily bread for his family for all these years.  This is why he works at least 9 hours each day.\r\n\r\nLuis comments that one of the most complicated tasks is cutting the trunks of the plant because they are very solid.  He carries out this activity on rented land, but he dreams of one day being able to have his own farm, so that he can offer his family a better life.  It is in order to realize this dream that Luis is aware that he has to work hard and each day improve his work.  \r\n\r\nThis is why he is applying for a loan, which he will invest in repairing and maintaining his machinery with which he extracts the juice from the sugarcane, with which he later makes sugar and other derivatives.  Moreover, this loan will also help him acquire some tools which he needs for harvesting this fruit.\r\n\r\nLuis searched many times for ways to obtain financing, but it was not possible.  Nevertheless, Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa opened doors for him and he received personalized help, not just from his loan officer but also from Kiva, who give the entrepreneur lots of support.  Luis is grateful to the investors who decide to contribute to his business, because it means a lot when people from other countries decide to trust in the dreams of a person like him."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":527.07,"image":{"id":1394159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to repair and buy tools and machinery for his work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pacto","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-24T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-23T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":93.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":99.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":102.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168.43,"local_amount":167.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":168.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814469,"comment":null},{"amount":88.46,"local_amount":87.77,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":88.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320640,"comment":null},{"amount":87.11,"local_amount":86.42,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":87.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856330,"comment":null},{"amount":24.69,"local_amount":24.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":24.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059906,"comment":null},{"amount":158.38,"local_amount":157.14,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":158.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T21:16:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585709,"name":"Maka Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are the five members of the Maka group.

is 23 years old, married and lives with her husband, mother and grandfather in the town of Kutaisi.  Shorena works at a beauty salon as a hair stylist and gets a monthly salary. Her husband is a loader, her mother is a teacher, and her grandfather is provided with a retirement pension.  All the family members have their income, but the amount of the monthly sources is not enough to cover everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nSo, Shorena decided to start a clothing sales business with the loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  Shorena\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she didn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. She received this credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Startup Program gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan of 1300 USD, Shorena will purchase clothing at wholesale prices and sell it in her community door-to-door.  Her regular customers will be her co-workers and neighbors.  She plans to sell a wide assortment of well-priced clothing for men, women and children.  It is obvious that the job is hard for Shorena, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her trading business gradually. The Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased thanks to Kiva Lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":298.14,"image":{"id":1392629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kutaisi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-24T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-23T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":59.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":64.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":65.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":67.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":73.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":74.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":87.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":88.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.28,"local_amount":50.28,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":50.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857597,"comment":null},{"amount":59.15,"local_amount":59.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":59.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134246,"comment":null},{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":61.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":61.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107829,"comment":null},{"amount":62.27,"local_amount":62.27,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":62.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255363,"comment":null},{"amount":64.77,"local_amount":64.77,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":64.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019494,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T04:27:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586584,"name":"Manuela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Manuela  es una se\u00f1ora soltera de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su hijo de 7 a\u00f1os en el Caser\u00edo Chirij- Cruz, Aldea Xejuyup Nahual\u00e1, Solol\u00e1.\nElla se dedica a la compraventa de ropa t\u00edpica como cortes y g\u00fcipiles, esta actividad lo realiza en diferentes comunidades de la boca costa espec\u00edficamente en Nahual\u00e1 e Ixtahuac\u00e1n.

They have three milk cows and produce cheese which is sold locally. Their income is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. Aza requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business and build a greenhouse. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income. With the loan, Aza will purchase all the building materials for the greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built properly, Aza will grow greens and various vegetables. The harvested products will be sold for a good price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family income and all members will improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":398.66,"image":{"id":1392682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase building materials and construct a greenhouse.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Sakulia","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-24T09:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-23T09:30:01Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.61},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":137.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":138.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":141.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":152.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":149.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":155.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":162.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":169.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":174.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":177.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":183.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":186.89},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":191.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":198.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":206.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":211.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.79,"local_amount":131.61,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":131.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857598,"comment":null},{"amount":75.9,"local_amount":125.19,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":125.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134247,"comment":null},{"amount":79.64,"local_amount":131.37,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":131.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107830,"comment":null},{"amount":79.8,"local_amount":131.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":132,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255364,"comment":null},{"amount":83.53,"local_amount":137.77,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":138.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019495,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-01T13:53:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585758,"name":"Hanan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanan is 28 years old from Gaza.

She later obtained a loan of ugx.1,000,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX) from UGAFODE which has helped them to increase her production and modernize her plantation. This motivated them to mobilize their fellow farmers to form a development group called Rwentobo Tutungukye.

She has passed through difficult moments because she never had the help of the father of her children. And due to the lack of work opportunities, she lacked many necessities. This motivated her to initiate her own business. Sandra began selling natural juices and fried foods (several kinds of buns, including chicken, and stuffed potatoes).

For this reason, she works long days, opening her stall at 6:00 am and closing it at 7:00 at night.\r\n\r\nWith the loan Sandra requests, she intends to purchase a coffee maker and a selection of stuffed buns, pastries, and stuffed potatoes. She wants to offer a greater variety of products and satisfy the needs and likes of her customers who transit the location. Thus she will have a better opportunity of improving her income and achieving her dream of having her own shop, where customers can be more comfortable.

It also has the second highest population in Liberia. Kumbah has a business selling rice, pepper, oil, Vita (a fruit drink), onions and other items from a table for the past two years. She works 10 hours at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is too few goods in her shop. She intends to use the loan to buy more rice, pepper, oil, Vita, onions and other items to sell in her business. She started her business with money from her mother.

He was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I hail from Peru's Puno region, renowned for quality alpaca and sheep wool. I have been dedicated to the textile arts for more than 25 years; it has been a family trade for generations. When I first began to weave, I worked on the rustic looms that I built along with other family members. Together we sold our wares at local markets until we were able to acquire modern machinery, which in turn has allowed us to develop newer designs.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you all for participating in this microcredit. It is a great support for artisans like me, because it enables me to invest in the materials I need to increase my stock. It also makes it possible for me to develop my new designs which I hope you'll like. On behalf of many Andean families, including mine, I would like to send greetings filled with the same warmth of our alpaca wool, as well as our eternal gratitude! Many thanks, and best wishes for joy and prosperity!\"\r\n\r\nUse this link to view Nestor's alpaca accessories and throws on the NOVICA site: http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/3463."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2619.08,"image":{"id":1147843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase larger amounts of alpaca wool to increase production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2013-07-24T17:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-23T17:00:20Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nestor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2850,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":329.74,"local_amount":329.74,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T17:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":329.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410186679,"comment":null},{"amount":973.34,"local_amount":973.34,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T19:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":973.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419949301,"comment":null},{"amount":658,"local_amount":658,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":658,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602111,"comment":null},{"amount":658,"local_amount":658,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":658,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829159,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-26T12:36:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585898,"name":"Oretha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oretha live in the Paynesville North area, which has a large local market in Montsorrade.

With limited career options, due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, she is one of the many Iraqi women who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has ten years of experience with her home based sewing business activity and to improve the services she can offer her customers as well as improve her work conditions she would like to buy an air-conditioning unit to try to make working during the extremely hot summer days a bit more bearable, and good quality raw materials to work with. To be able to make this purchase she took a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq offers 'group loans' for clients unable to provide a guarantor, and therefore unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity.

She\u2019s spent her entire life in the countryside where her mother taught her agricultural work and how to raise animals.  \r\n\r\nThanks to this Dina has been able to generate her own income to provide daily sustenance at home since she currently raises and fattens up pigs for subsequent sale.  She is a very tenacious woman who strives daily to provide well-being for her little girl who motivates her to continue forward always.  \r\n\r\nThis is why Dina has decided to request her first loan because she wants to buy more pigs to raise and fatten up and to earn income from the sale of the animals.  This will help her improve her living conditions and overcome obstacles that come up because of economic instability so she can provide her family with better quality of life and her daughter with a good education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":126.43,"image":{"id":1394895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more piglets to raise and fatten up.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Monter\u00eda","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-07-24T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-23T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35781},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":36757},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37759},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":38789},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":39846},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40933},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":42049},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":43196},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44374},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45584},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46827},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48105}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.18,"local_amount":36699,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":37977.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390982385,"comment":null},{"amount":19.76,"local_amount":35923,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:59:06Z","rounded_local_amount":37174.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822248,"comment":null},{"amount":20.72,"local_amount":37703,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":39016.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807241,"comment":null},{"amount":21.34,"local_amount":38721,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":40069.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095332,"comment":null},{"amount":21.91,"local_amount":39907,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":41296.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074399,"comment":null},{"amount":22.52,"local_amount":40837,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":42259.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009592,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-24T19:10:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586786,"name":"Nueva Union Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Nueva Uni\u00f3n est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 1 del programa de comit\u00e9, ellas est\u00e1n aprendiendo a trabajar juntas, hacen actividades para fomentar su compa\u00f1erismo.

Por falta de educaci\u00f3n no le fue f\u00e1cil conseguir oportunidades de empleo, debido a que no sabe leer, ni escribir, su \u00fanica opci\u00f3n fue emplearse como reciclador en una chatarrer\u00eda, donde labora hace ya 12 a\u00f1os; adicionalmente y para complementar sus ingresos, cuenta con algunas vacas lecheras y ganado de levante al que cr\u00eda y cuida sobrepasando los obst\u00e1culos que se le presentan debido a que los insumos agr\u00edcolas son muy costosos y el precio de venta de la leche disminuye constantemente, generando una inestabilidad econ\u00f3mica y una dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n en su hogar. Por este motivo, Arnulfo busca apoyo con el tercer ciclo de cr\u00e9dito, para invertirlo en la compra de una vaca productora de leche y una ternera de levante, con el fin de aumentar su producci\u00f3n y poder mejorar los ingresos por las ventas, esto le ayudar\u00e1 a cumplir el sue\u00f1o de salirse de su empleo como reciclador y dedicarse a su familia y al cuidado de sus animales, de esta forma podr\u00e1 mejorar la calidad de vida de la familia y brindarle a su hijo, la oportunidad que \u00e9l nunca tuvo por falta de recursos\u2026 Educaci\u00f3n. ","en":"Arnulfo, 43, lives with his wife and his 19-year-old son. From a young age, he has always lived in the countryside, where his father taught him about farming and ranching. Due to a lack of education, it was not easy for him to find work opportunities. Because he does not know how to read or write, his only option was to be employed as a recycler at a scrapyard, where he has worked for 12 years. To complement his income, he has some dairy cows and breeding cattle that he raises and cares for, overcoming obstacles that present themselves, since farm supplies are expensive and the sale price of milk is constantly going down, which creates economic instability and a difficult situation in his house. This is why Arnulfo is asking for a third loan to invest in the purchase of a dairy cow and a weaned calf, with the goal of increasing production and improving his income through sales. This will help him achieve his dream of leaving his recycling job and dedicating himself to his family and caring for his animals. This way, he will be able to improve his family's quality of life and give his son the opportunity that he never had due to a lack of resources...education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":308.26,"image":{"id":1394880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to
