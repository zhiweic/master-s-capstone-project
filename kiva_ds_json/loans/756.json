The restaurant employs eight people, and Julio is happy that he can contribute to the economy in a positive way by offering job opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge for Julio in his business venture has been obtaining the funding he needs to continue making improvements to the restaurant. Without credit in the United States, it has been very difficult for Julio to find a loan. This loan from Accion USA will enable Julio to purchase tables and chairs for the bakery, build a take-out window, and renovate a bathroom. The financial assistance will have a huge impact on the business, because it will allow the bakery to bring in more customers by providing additional seating. Julio is hoping that it will become a gathering place for many, so he can share his piece of Colombia with the community.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs long as my customers are happy, I am

He grows cacao and coffee, which are products with a lot of market demand. \r\n\r\nThis is why he has been growing this product for more than 10 years, even though in the beginning he was discouraged, because he still wasn't earning enough income, and that discouraged him from continuing. \r\n\r\nWilliam had even decided to sell his farmland, but his dear wife intervened and wouldn't let him give it up. Now William is grateful to his dear wife, because thanks to her, he managed to keep his parcel, and now he is getting good earnings from growing these crops.  \r\n\r\nThis why he now wishes to expand his plantation.

She has a 3-year-old daughter and a 10-month-old son.  In search of a source of income for her family, Kanymbu decided to launch her own food sale and catering business.  The shop in which Kanymbu works also serves as a dining room.  One can have a bite to eat and buy the necessary food products.  Kanymbu has worked very hard to develop her business and has been very successful:  her business now brings in close to 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  Today, Kanymbu doesn't have a wide range of food items.  This is why she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners and requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).  This loan will allow her to buy a broader range of merchandise, attract a larger number of customers and increase her sales.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":979685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a broader variety of food products.

Quelita sells groceries out of a store set up in her house.  Here she attends to her customers, the majority of whom are neighbors.  She started the business to make extra income and has been in it now for six years.  With the help of a loan and her own savings she was able to set up the store and over time has grown and attraced many customers.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it allows her to be at home and have an income while also having free time for other activities and housework.  What she does not like so much is when customers ask for credit for their purchases since she has had several bad experiences.  So now she sells everything on a cash basis which gives her better results.  \r\n\r\nShe plans to continue growing and expanding the business.  This is her second loan through MFP and she is grateful for the financial support so she can carry out her plans.  She likes her communal bank and knows all the members, who she considers to be responsible, supportive people.

He lives in a common-law marriage with Jessica who helps him attending the family business. They live in their own house with their four-year-old son. Heisen's activity consists in renting video games. He has installed four play stations at home, where he has a room with tables and chairs for the convenience of his customers. The booths are rented to neighbors and other people requesting his services. He told us that he learned this activity five years ago from his brothers who are also active in this business. Eventually he managed to save some money and used it as start capital for his own business, and now he and his partner attend it together. He likes his business because it gives him an income to cover household expenses and keeps him busy.\r\n\r\nNow his highest priority is to finish his education as a civil engineer and open a consulting business to draw up design plans. He wants to start with the purchase of a computer. To realize his plans and get the needed financial resources, he came to the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma and applied for his second loan. He likes his communal bank, because in addition to their support he feels at ease and confident when dealing with them. He will invest the 1200 new soles of the loan in a computer with the goal to provide consultancy services in civil engineering.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":980116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a computer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T12:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Heisen ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":181.35},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":179.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":198.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":206.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":210.68},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":223.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.01,"local_amount":181.35,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":183.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246263,"comment":null},{"amount":67.45,"local_amount":179.88,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":181.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386272,"comment":null},{"amount":74.38,"local_amount":198.33,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":200.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099366,"comment":null},{"amount":77.49,"local_amount":206.65,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":208.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713512,"comment":null},{"amount":79,"local_amount":210.68,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":212.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202404,"comment":null},{"amount":83.67,"local_amount":223.11,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":225.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098085,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T00:58:03Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380371,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia se sigue dedicando al negocio de restuarant,ella prepara platos como cuy al horno,pollo al horno y sopas,la socia atiende desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 6:00 p.m,la socia tambien vende gaseosas y cervezas,por medio de este negocio la socia saca adelante a sus hijos,el sue\u00f1o de la socia es ampliar el local de restaurant.La socia solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar productos para cocinar como carne,pollo y verduras y tambien para comprar cerveza y gaseosas al por amyor.\n La socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.\n","en":"This member is still running her restaurant.

He lives comfortably in his own home. \r\n\r\nThe activity that Victor currently pursues is to give transportation services to passengers in a car that he bought with the sum of his savings plus a particular loan. He initiated this business 10 years ago and in the time that has passed he has replaced pieces and parts while it deteriorates because of its daily use. He likes his business because it permits him to have an economic income with which to resolve the family expenses and he began it because of the necessity to count on an economic income when he could not find a job. Now he feels there is more security because he can manage his own hours, in addition to being his own boss. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, he comments that he does not like it when his taxi is broken too often because it leads to many expenses, but still he can see good results, for this reason he has plans to grow and be able to buy a transport vehicle for heavy cargo. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he wants to venture into the sale of clothing to obtain more wages.

He travels twice a week, bringing maca, peas and potatoes, which he sells at \"La parada\", the largest market in the country. \r\n\r\nAs he's a country man, he takes advantage of owning three horses and three donkeys and uses them as cargo animals to transport fertilizer to the fields. \"This way I get less tired,\" he explains. \r\n\r\nThis is Cesar's fifth loan with MFP, and is happy to know that he will have financial support and feels secure continuing with his work. Apart from anything else he promises to comply with his payments. Furthermore he appreciates being a part of his community bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nUpon receiving the funds, Cesar will invest the money requested in the purchase of natural fertilizers to spread on his crops, which include several varieties of potato such as yungay, canch\u00e1n, Andean and huario macho.

The inhabitants of Nazca are very generous and hospitable people.  This city has a cultural heritage that we, as Peruvians, are very proud of because this is where the Nazca lines are found. They were drawn in a big field and were used by the Nasca culture for farming. They were a type of calendar where the people could figure out when the rainy season would be. These majestic lines attract a great number of tourists. \r\n\r\nPeru is well-known for its exquisite food, but the dish that Elizabeth likes the most is \u201cAji de Gallina\u201d (chile chicken).  She tells us that she could eat this dish every day without tiring of it.  Elizabeth attended school up to the fifth year of high school.  However, she would have liked to have studied administration at the university.  Because her parents did not have sufficient financial resources, she had to work since she was little in order to help at home.\r\n\r\nShe has three children, ages 12, 20, and 22.  The youngest is in the first year of high school, and the older ones attend the university.  Elizabeth struggles a great deal in order to get her children ahead because she is a single mother.  She supports them with great devotion because she wants them to be better than she is.  She wants them to be proud to have a profession and not to have to experience the hardships she lived through since she was little.\r\n\r\nElizabeth sells sweets, soft drinks, and beer.  She used to only sell her products from her tricycle.  But, she saved and now has tables where her customers can sit.  She works around ten hours a day.  She can take care of 30 customers in a day, and she is able to earn up to 100 soles a day; on a very good day she can earn 250 soles.  This helps her with the additional household expenses or her children\u2019s additional educational expenses.  She believes it is going well for her in her business because of her dedication.  She takes very good care of her customers so that they always return to buy her products.\r\n\r\nShe is now very grateful to the Kiva lenders.

Since Claudio\u2019s move to the United States 20 years ago, he has worked on farms in upstate New York and found seasonal employment at different factories during the winter months. Fascinated by the variety of produce that is grown in the U.S., Claudio made a decision seven years ago to rent land and start a farm of his own farm \u2013 sustained with support from the Grow NYC New Farmer Development program.  \n\nWhen Hurricane Irene swept through upstate New York \u2013 devastating crops from Claudio's farm \u2013 it was his loyal Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) members that took immediate action to save his business. By collectively pooling their savings, Claudio\u2019s CSA was able offset lost income and monetary damages and kept Claudio\u2019s farm from going under. This demonstration of un-coerced, homegrown support is no less organic than the farm fresh vegetables Claudio has been selling for over seven years. With a variety of over 50 types of vegetables sold at six different markets throughout New York City, Claudio has amassed a dedicated following of patrons that can quickly discern the quality of Claudio\u2019s produce. \n\nIn 2011, Claudio searched for loan capital to help cover the cost of his next batch of seedlings for the spring, but like other immigrant entrepreneurs, a short credit history made it challenging for him to secure funding for his business. As a member of Grow NYC, Claudio attended a financing workshop on Dec. 1 and met ACCION USA Business Development Officer Erica Dorn, who saw potential in Claudio\u2019s business. \u201cI really saw some strengths in Claudio, particularly with his business momentum and strong CSA relationships,\u201d said Erica. Looking beyond Claudio\u2019s credit score, ACCION USA approved a microloan for seedlings, helping Claudio to stabilize his business during tough winter months.

They live in their own house in the district of Kimbiri.  Astria is a farmer and has land where she grows coffee and cocoa.  For 21 years she has worked on her own land, and at harvest time she has the support of her children and hired workers so she can collect the crop more quickly.  \r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is harvesting the fruits because she feels all the months of hard work have their compensation in the quality of the crop.  She feels the most difficult part is transporting the products from the land to the wholesale center in the city of San Francisco, where they pay the best prices for her cocoa and coffee beans.  Another difficulty is not having sufficient income to pay the workers in advance for their support at harvest time.  So she depends on loans through the MFP institution.  Her top priority now is to plant more cocoa and coffee on her 2 hectares of uncultivated land.  This is her eighth loan through MFP.  She feels the loan is very helpful in getting ahead in her work.  She is a very beloved member of her communal bank.  With the 1,000 PEN loan she plans to buy cocoa and coffee plans to increase her cropland.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":980552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cocoa and coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T10:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455466,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T15:10:29Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380492,"name":"Paubla Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Paubla, es originaria de Quezalguaque municipio de  Le\u00f3n, de oficio comerciante se dedica a la venta de comida y refrescos, tiene 1 hijo de 19 a\u00f1os de edad, lleva 15 a\u00f1os con esta actividad.

Feliciano is the means of support of his family.  From a young age his parents taught him to work on the farm.  Now he has a plot of land with coffee plants.  He has been working his own land for 23 years, and at harvest time he counts on the help of his children and on the labor of day laborers to make quicker progress with the extraction of the fruit.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his job is harvesting the fruit of the plants because in this way he feels that the months of hard work pay him back with the quality of fruit.  He considers the hardest part to be transporting his products from the farm to the distribution centers located in the city of San Francisco, where they offer better prices for his coffee beans.  The difficulty Feliciano has is not being able to have enough income to make the payments in advance to the day laborers who help him with the harvests.  This is why he turns to the loans that the MFP institution facilitates.  But now what he gives priority to is planting more coffee plants.\r\n\r\nThis will be his eighth loan with MFP.

Nazca is a city whose inhabitants are very generous and hospitable. It has a cultural heritage: as Peruvians, we are very proud of this city since it has the Nazca Lines. They were drawn over extensive fields and were used by the Nazca culture in its agriculture; they are a type of calendar whereby one could determine when the rainy season might arrive. Because of these majestic lines, the city welcomes an infinity of tourists every year. \r\n\r\nMarcial only studied up to the 6th grade of primary. His parents had few economic resources. He would have liked to study music in a center or specialized school, since music is his life and his work tool. \r\n\r\nMarcial is an example of struggle, evidence that when one desires to get ahead, come what may, it can be achieved. Some years ago, Marcial suffered a terrible accident while traveling with his wife. She lost her life and he nearly became blind; he still has very poor vision. As a result, he was left a widower with a son to care for but he has advanced despite adversity. This demonstrates that, at times, we lack awareness that there are people who need more help than we do. With effort and dedication, and especially, much love of life, he struggles every day without tiring or giving up.\r\n\r\nAt present, Marcial is committed to the music business, composing, especially, Peruvian folkloric music. He also performs his music at events and concerts which he presents throughout his city, which he does very well, despite his limited vision. He travels to diverse parts of the city to give his concerts, and does so alongside his faithful companion, friend and right hand, his son, who would give his life and struggle against all and everyone, to see his father happy. Marcial works around 15 hours a week, depending on how many events he schedules. They usually occur on weekends. Marcial earns around 700 new sols a week and in a good week he can earn up to 1,500 new sols. He comments that his business is doing well because God is on his side every day, as He was at the time of the accident, since Marcial is alive and can care for his son who at that time was very small; also because despite not seeing very well, he can play music with feeling and, therefore, very beautifully. Also, he is much appreciated by his clients and they often recommend him owing to his good work and punctuality.\r\n\r\nMarcial gives thanks to God and to Kiva investors for the help he has received, since thanks to them, he can now make a publicity video to deliver to Peru's TV networks. With that, he will become known at the national level and give more monthly concerts and earn more income, enabling him to continue saving to achieve his dream: to travel to Cuba for an operation to recover his sight, then continue struggling for a good life and, most of all, to see his son become a professional that he can be proud of.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":980736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical

anything. She is the mother of three children, whose ages are 6, 17, and 19. The youngest is in the first year of education. The two oldest, whom she has raised with much effort, study at the university. Doris likes to prepare sweets and cook in her free time. For that reason, she always prepares her favorite dish, which is \"chicken with rice.\" She tells us that her children love her way of cooking. For that reason, she would have liked to study gastronomy, but because of her parents' limited economic resources, she was not able to do it. Thus she struggles every day so that her children can have careers, and she won't rest until this is achieved.\r\n\r\nDoris now has her own business where she sells groceries, clothing, soft drinks, and beer. She works about 12 hours every day and waits on 15 to 20 customers in a day. She can earn up to 40 PEN, and on a very good day she can earn up to 60 PEN. She believes that her business does well because she offers good service to her customers. \r\n\r\nDoris is very thankful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business (groceries and sample clothing for ordering), and with it she will have a greater variety of products and greater income, so that she can continue saving to be able to fulfill her most desired dream: to have her children have successful careers and to improve their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":980743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy merchandise (groceries and clothing) for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T05:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":75.87},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":78.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":87.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":91.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.35,"local_amount":75.87,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":81.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271209,"comment":null},{"amount":31.53,"local_amount":78.84,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":84.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993858,"comment":null},{"amount":32.39,"local_amount":80.97,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":87.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601765,"comment":null},{"amount":33.89,"local_amount":84.72,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":91.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090881,"comment":null},{"amount":71.84,"local_amount":179.6,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":193.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287221963,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T08:48:36Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380511,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen is 32 years old and married.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGliceria operates a variety store. In the Philippines a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGliceria hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":980845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-01-13T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gliceria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":280,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12317.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146161,"comment":null},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10264.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275373,"comment":null},{"amount":186.67,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8211.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997875,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T20:07:17Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:47:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380528,"name":"Lisbeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lisbeth is from Carmen Annex, Ozamis City, Misamis Occidental.

She is married to Arbi, a mechanic. She is also mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLorna operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house, and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 32,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nLorna hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":980859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-01-13T20:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2133.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":12799.98,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":13196.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146163,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":8533.02,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8797.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275378,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":10667,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10997.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997877,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T21:55:43Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380532,"name":"Luisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luisa is a 32-year-old woman living in the town of Salelologa.

Sharel has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 750 Samoa talas (WST) a month (approximately $350 USD) from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Sharel joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and for the ability to engage in business activities. Sharel is requesting her first loan of 1000 WST from SPBD, which will be used to purchase additional goods to sell.

Kimberly has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 450 Samoa talas (WST) (approximately $280 USD) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Kimberly joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and gain the ability to engage in business activities. Kimberly requested her first loan of 1000 WST from SPBD, which will be used to purchase chemicals such as Gramoxome. The loan will be the first loan taken out by Kimberly from SPBD.

Vasati has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 800 Samoa talas (WST) (approximately $400 USD) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Vasati joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to gain the ability to engage in business activities.      Vasati requested her first loan of 1,000 WST from SPBD, which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Wilma is requesting a PHP26, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nWilma hopes to give her children a good future and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals during the evening when all  family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Rose's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 400 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Rose is requesting a loan for 16,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRose dreams of giving her her children a high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

is Merlita, 42, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMerlita operates a business selling sugar. What she basically does is buy sacks of sugar from wholesalers, repack them and sell them per kilo to individuals, general store owners, and the local community. Sugar is repacked in \u00bc, 1\/2, and 1 kilo packages. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more sugar to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMerlita dreams to be able to give all of her children a high quality education through her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets every week with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work, and to draw strength and inspiration from her study of the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":980920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To buy sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-01-13T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merlita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3519.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146166,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.02,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2345.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275385,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2933.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997880,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T18:15:18Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380557,"name":"Ngan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngan is 42 years old, married, and has one son.
