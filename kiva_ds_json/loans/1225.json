She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.  This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins.  They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese government.  Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney.  The modifications made it open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.  Now, jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, and to repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":408.33,"image":{"id":1437734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to pay for spare parts and maintenance for their jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bienvinida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6293.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824877,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6293.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478699,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5034.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701101,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-05T07:40:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611373,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcelina is married and has four children.

That\u2019s where he learned agricultural work, thanks to his parents\u2019 teaching. Now he sells young cattle. He raises them and feeds them and then sells them. This is how he generates sufficient income to take care of his household and provide for his family\u2019s basic needs. His family is his wife and their three children. He is thriving and a hard worker, characteristics that are well-known among people who live in the countryside. With painstaking care and dedication he has achieved his goals. He is requesting a loan because he wants to buy more young cattle. This way he could increase his production and have the possibility of improving the income margin he receives from the sale of his cattle.

He is a very hardworking soldier who gets a low salary. In addition to his career, he has a small grocery store that used to cover his family's expenses (brothers and parents). He is a responsible and determined man who is always seeking alternative opportunities to help provide a better life for his family. Mohammed's house is located in a rural area and he needs to make some improvements to it. He plans to install doors and windows and finish building a bedroom. He is very excited about these modifications because he knows that it will make his family safer and more comfortable.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is made up of cousins from three families living in the same village.  They range in age from 18 to 26 years old.  The group members are not employed and have been relying on seasonal casual labour as a source of income.  They came together to start this group so that they could make more money from their farming activities.  They are undertaking horticulture as their income-generating project, which is located on one of the member\u2019s homesteads.  From the proceeds of their project, they will raise income for their families. \n\nThey intend to use this loan to purchase a drip kit, seedlings and fertilizers as well to construct a mushroom growing house.  From the proceeds of the first crop under drip irrigation, they intend to purchase mushroom spores and increase the area of their cropping under drip irrigation.  The group plans to increase the area under drip irrigation from 250 to 750 square meters, by purchasing more drip kits over the next two cropping cycles (six to eight months from now).  With the introduction of mushroom production into their business, they aim to supply the local market as well as food outlets.  They also would like to use the proceeds from their business to build their own houses so that when they start their own families they are staying on the same homesteads with their parents or relatives. \n\nSimelukuthula (the group leader) is a young woman aged 26 and has twin children, a girl and a boy, aged two.  She currently stays on her own as her husband migrated to South Africa in search for employment.  However, since he migrated a year ago, he has struggled to find permanent employment and has therefore been unable to send any money to support the children he left behind.  Simelukuthula has thus been engaged in trading a variety of trinkets from which she raises money to take care of her children.  With proceeds from this loan, it is her hope that her income will increase and she will save to purchase household assets and build her own house. \n\nPENYA assists borrowers with entrepreneurial skills training through the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) Program.  PENYA also helps them form Village Savings and Loans Associations where they save proceeds from their businesses that will then become the future sources of additional loans and business investments.  Finally, PENYA carries out mentoring and monitoring visits to ensure that the businesses are being run viably.  Through linkages created with extension workers and some buyers, PENYA borrowers have access to further training in the production and selling of their produce."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1439720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a drip kit, seedlings and fertilizers as well to construct a mushroom growing house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Chegutu Rural","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":299,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T08:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T08:50:02Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simelikuthula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinotenda ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-01T02:01:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611407,"name":"Keelian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Keelian lives in Kongowea area near Mombasa, Kenya.

He is asking for the loan to invest in wholesale merchandise (brown sugar, grains, pasta, cookies, meat products, and more). This way, he can stock up on what people ask him for that he doesn't have and widen the variety of products to satisfy the needs of his buyers. This way, the profit margin will notable increase and he will be able to sell more products. Julio dreams of having the possibility of giving his children a college education.

This will help her to achieve economic stability and a pleasant quality of life that she may enjoy with with her loved ones.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1442373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a refrigerator and wholesale supplies (snacks, soft drinks, bulk grains, biscuits, dairy products, among others).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74772},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76840},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78965},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81150},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83394},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85701},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88072},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90508},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93011},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95584},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98228},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100945},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103737},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106607},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109556},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112586},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115700},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118901},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122190},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125569},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129043},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132612},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136280},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140049}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.43},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611449,"name":"Grashana Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivel is the featured borrower of the Grashana group.

Here is a story of a woman by the name of Ms. Samina, who was deprived basic necessities in her childhood. She found many problems during her own career building, and found non-conducive environment.\n\nSamina wants to serve her community through quality education. She explained her dream of community-oriented school for the deprived children. She says: \u201cI feel pain for the children who are not going to school because of financial barriers.\u201d  She opened her school in 2008 with the help of her husband.  \n\nInitially, she was teaching in another building that did not satisfy her eagerness of quality education. In 2008, the school had only two desks, one black board, one box of chalks, one teacher, and 10 students enrolled. She said that she started investing the entire income of her house on the school and waiting for best results. \n\nSamina says: \"It was hard time and we were facing many problems. Later on, income increased day by day because of our hardship and continued efforts.\" \n\nIn 2010, she went for a new building to expand her school. In the new building, she enrolled 32 students, and later on the enrollment increased to 95 students. She said during this, the building owner died and his son insists us to pay rent too high. At this point, she shifted her school into her house because of landlord misbehavior. She says that she was very disturbed and her school went down day by day.\n\nShe heard about Kashf Foundation through their family friends, and met Kashf staff for school loan purpose. Kashf team briefed her about Kashf School Sarmaya and its procedures. She shared her mission and vision with the Kashf team members. She discussed that if she gets the loan, she can provide many other good opportunities to her learners.

This is 42 year old Susan from Mutare. She is widowed and has two children, one attending school.  Susan runs a retail business selling clothes and electrical gadgets. The business has been in operation for four years. She says the main challenges faced are high import duty at border posts and high transport costs.

He left there for work.  Farida is a kind and hardworking woman.  According to her friends' opinion, she is very outgoing and welcoming.  Farida loves animals and loves to feed them.  She transformed her favorite occupation into a profitable business.  Today Farida has several heads of small livestock and wants to get involved into a more serious business, for example, buying and selling cattle.  Of course, her relatives will help her with this because it would not be easy for her to fatten up livestock and resell it by herself.  She came to Arvand to make her plans come to fruition.  Farida plans to use this loan to buy livestock and increase her livestock headcount.

is a young veterinarian from Armavir city of Armavir region. He lives with his parents and three sisters. Karlen, his father and his oldest sister are the ones who take care of the family's everyday needs. Karlen runs two local veterinary pharmacies, where different vet medications are sold. He currently needs to make some investments in his small business in order for it to function in a sustainable way. To reach that goal Karlen needs a loan of USD 3000 in order to purchase vet medications to resell in the pharmacies. He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately wasn't able to repay it back. However, thanks to his hard work, Karlen was able to run his business in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Karlen will be thankful to all the lenders for helping him to sustain his small business"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1437895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Veterinary Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase vet medication to resell in pharmacies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Nor Kesaria village, Armavir region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karlen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":107.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":114.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":112.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":118.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":122.21},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":127.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":130.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":130.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":137.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":143.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":144.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.08},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611494,"name":"Kanyanku Ugafode Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kanyanku Ugafode group is located on the outskirts of Rukungiri Town.

Despite the difficulties in the area of maintaining revenue-generating businesses, these members are very courageous and fairly robust in their determination. The members are in solidarity with one another and live in the same village. The main work is small-scale commerce, along with farming during the rainy season. \r\n\r\nMs. Mariama (seated at the right with her left hand raised) is the featured borrower of the group. She is 47 years old, married, and the mother of three children (a girl and two boys). Her business involves processing peanuts into peanut butter, which she resells at the weekly international market in the sub-region. To do so, she purchases peanuts by the sack or basin, according to what is available on the market. She sorts them and cooks them, and then finally processes them by machine to obtain peanut butter for sale by 15- or 20-liter pails.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to purchase three 50-kg sacks of peanuts at 12,500 francs CFA to process and resell. \r\n\r\nThe profits will be used to help her husband to manage the family day to day, and some of it will go into her savings account. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1430395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase peanuts to process and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T18:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T18:00:12Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonkarou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tacko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Penda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tacko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boulayel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Halimatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Diadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koumanthio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diabouyel Issa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diabou Boudy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dienabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Danfang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sountoukoung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Souba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T07:37:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611659,"name":"Remedios","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remedios is 56 years old and married.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

She earns a minimum of PHP 1,500 in sales daily.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan.

As a child development major at San Diego State University, she was an integral component in the development of a \u201ckindergarten readiness curriculum\u201d that was subsequently implemented in Head Start programs around the country.  \u201cChildcare is my passion, I love getting down and playing with the kids and doing activities. It\u2019s satisfying to watch them learn new things,\u201d she shared.\r\n\r\nAfter her son Henry (pictured) was born, Louise sought a way to continue her passion of working with children while remaining a stay at home mom. It seemed only natural to start Green Beans and Little Sprouts, a healthy living preschool with an emphasis on hands-on education. Green Beans and Little Sprouts emphasizes the \u201cReggio Amelia\u201d method of teaching, entailing that students have some control over the direction of their learning in a supportive and enriching environment.  Louise plans to employ three teachers, dividing her space into an \u201cinfant room\u201d, \u201ctoddler room\u201d and \u201cpreschool room\u201d. \r\n \r\nChildren enrolled are taught the importance of a healthy diet and eat exclusively organic food arriving regularly from local farms. She shared, \u201cHealthy food is very important to us; our kids will often request milk or water as opposed to sodas when out of the classroom. That makes me feel great.\u201d Music and language are also an important component of the curriculum that Louise has created. Students are engaged in Spanish songs weekly as the importance of being bilingual from an early age is highlighted.\r\n\r\nKiva is an ideal financing solution for Louise as traditional loans were not an option for her. She shared, \u201cBanks were telling me that I needed to have been in business for two years before being considered for a loan, how was I supposed to do that?\u201d After securing rent payments for the first two months as well as an initial deposit from family members, Louise looked to the community for help. \r\n\r\nLouise will use her $10,000 Kiva loan to furnish her preschool, purchase necessary educational equipment and cover initial payroll for each of the instructors. In addition, these funds will ensure that only the highest quality organic local foods are provided for her students.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her business will continue to take root and that her work will create a positive impact in the lives of her students. Although Louise currently has a license for six students, she will be moving in October to a new location that will accommodate over twenty. When asked about her future dreams, she joked, \u201cMaybe I have to start an elementary school next!\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":581.58,"image":{"id":1438136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

They have, as their main business, the sale and growth of peanuts during the rainy season. Ms. Awa (standing to the far right with her hand raised) is the star borrower of the group. She is married, 33 years old, and the mother of 5 children, of which 3 are girls and 2 boys. She works exclusively in the sale of palm oil, the majority of which she buys in the sub-region for resale in bulk and at retail in the capital, the village and the weekly markets. With this new loan, she will be able to strengthen her financial capital by buying 3 drums of 20 liters at a cost of 15,500 f CFA per drum.

In this cycle, they want to continue learning how to manage their businesses.  One of the women said, \u201cWe learned in the first cycle how to control our expenses and how to manage our profit.  Now we want to learn more about how to make our businesses bigger.\u201d\n\nAng\u00e9lica Maria (1st from left) is 33 and has a third grade education.  She is in a domestic partnership and has five children, ages 11, 10, 8, 6 and a baby of 5 months.  The three oldest are in school.  The family lives in a one-room wood house constructed by her husband.  There is an outdoor kitchen and latrine.  There is no potable water so they get their water from a river about 150 yards away.  Her business is selling little chicks that she buys at one day old for about 60 US cents and sells after 2-3 weeks for about $1.20.  She spends her days selling chickens and looking after the children.  Her husband keeps an eye on the chicks at night (to avoid robbery) and works in whatever he can find during the day.  She supplies most of the income for the family, with her husband providing money when he finds work. \n\nAng\u00e9lica Maria plans to use the money from her loan to fix up the area where she keeps the chickens, including putting wire mesh all around to prevent them from being stolen, and also to buy more chickens.  She currently sells approximately 12,000 chickens a month.  She spends 120 hours on this business and the rest of her time taking care of the children and home.  Her current profit is about US$623, and she plans to eventually add 3,000 more chickens and increase her profit by 25%.  She wants to have enough money to send her fourth child to school when he is ready next year.  Her goal is to keep growing her business so that she can meet all the chicken needs of her area. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":362.41,"image":{"id":1442755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to fix up the area where she feeds her chicks and to buy more chicks for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Pajales, San Andres Villa Seca, Retalhuleu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T21:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T21:10:13Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magnolia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":8800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":977.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.55,"local_amount":974.26,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":988.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419860874,"comment":null},{"amount":113.28,"local_amount":886.07,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":898.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509411,"comment":null},{"amount":124.58,"local_amount":974.48,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":988.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733263,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-10T17:04:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611751,"name":"Jonah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jonah is 26 years old, married to Rachael, and they have one child who is four months old.\r\n\r\nHe has a business of selling shoes in Naivasha which he has operated for two years.

They are all from the same village and get along well with each other.\r\n\r\nThe women's main business is small shops. Ansatou (pictured standing on the right with her left hand raised) is the featured borrower of the group. She is 19 years old, married and the mother of 2 sons. Despite her young age she is a very dynamic woman and has two loan cycles to her credit so far. She is a reseller of spices and various other food products like green tea, sugar, refined oil, biscuits, and children's candy in the village. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ansatou plans to increase her stock of green tea by two packages, her stock of sugar by a half-bag, and her stock of candies and biscuits by containers for resale. The profits she earns from her business will allow her to put money into savings and to help her husband with the household expenses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1437035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to increase her stock of green tea by two cartons, her stock of sugar by a half-bag, and her stock of candies and biscuits by containers for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T22:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T22:20:07Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ansatou Seydi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siring","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tening","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ansata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dienabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata Malang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou Hoyo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnaling","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tening","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou Assane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Ousseye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadidiatou Mamadou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata Yacouba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna Iya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ansatou Bassirou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bandie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sirayel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1290000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1290000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T15:25:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611766,"name":"Harun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harun is 23 years old and supports his parents.

By doing this, she has been able to earn enough income to meet the financial burden that fell on her with the recent death of her husband. In spite of these difficulties, and the pain and sadness she has lived through, she has risen to the occasion, and is getting through this difficult test a little at a time. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be invested in her business through the purchase of raw materials at wholesale, including fabrics, thread, buttons, and more.
