The harvest, which he hopes will be very good, will provide food security for his household and he plans to sell the surplus and invest the money in a business to increase the family\u2019s income.\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, sorghum and millet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria west","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2013-12-12T21:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-10T21:30:12Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yustine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":56350,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":56350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T10:58:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":644581,"name":"Jonon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043d \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c 1 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0422\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043d \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0438\u043f\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043d \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433. \u041e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 1900 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0435. \u0412 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043c \u043e\u043d \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043c \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c. \n\n\n","en":"Jonon is an honest and hardworking person.

Founded in 2009, they provide micro-asset financing for farmers, administering loans for the purchase of dairy cows, chickens, and irrigation equipment. \r\n\r\nJuhudi would like to design, pilot, and scale a clean energy loan program so that they can begin to offer solar lighting, cook stove, and water loans to over 100,000 rural farmers over the next five years. In order to do this, they are working with MicroEnergy Credits (MEC), a for-profit social enterprise based in the US that works with financial institutions to set up and scale clean energy programs.\r\n\r\nMEC and Juhudi are requesting a loan of $50,000 USD from Kiva lenders to help pay for the up-front costs of designing a loan program for clean energy that will eventually serve 100,000 rural farmers. The loan will help fund \u2153 of the costs that MEC will incur in supporting Juhudi Kilimo, and specifically it will go to pay for the following program areas:\r\n\t\r\n\u2022\tHiring a program manager who will help perform market research, business planning, financial product design, pilot implementation, course correction, and scale-up of the clean energy lending program. The program manager will facilitate supplier relationships and ensure the data collection systems are in place to capture carbon revenue. \r\n\t\r\n\u2022\tSetting up \u201cCarbon Tracker\u201d: MicroEnergy Credits has developed carbon offset data management software called Carbon Tracker that enables an MFI to track clean energy product sales and delivery. This database is used to generate investment-grade carbon offsets and plays an integral role in after-sales services and monitoring. Part of this loan will be used set up Juhudi Kilimo with this software.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tEstablishing a carbon offset program at Juhudi Kilimo: MicroEnergy Credits facilitates the carbon origination, validation, and purchase agreements for the offsets generated by the MFIs clean energy loans. The up-front costs of this will be partially covered by this loan.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHiring MicroEnergy Officers (MEO): MEOs are front-line staff who will be placed at the branches within Juhudi Kilimo, and are providing clean energy marketing, last-mile distribution, and after-sales and warranty support.\r\n\t\t\r\nJuhudi Kilimo and MicroEnergy Credits seek Kiva funding to design, pilot, and scale a sustainable clean energy program to empower rural farmers with access to efficient cook stoves, solar lighting, water filters and biogas digesters.  \r\n\r\nMillions of families and small businesses around the world use outdated technology to light and warm their homes, cook their food, and clean their drinking water. The majority of rural Kenyans use inefficient stoves for cooking that use wood or charcoal for fuel, but these stoves produce harmful emissions and have a significant detrimental effect on health. Similarly, many rural Kenyans are not connected to the electricity grid and rely on kerosene lanterns for light, however these technologies produce emissions that are harmful to the users' health. \r\n\r\nThree main barriers exist that prevent the poor from upgrading to newer, cleaner, more efficient technologies:\t\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPoor distribution: poor infrastructure and low population density inhibit clean energy supplier outreach. \t\r\n\u2022\tLack of marketing: rural farmers have limited access to markets and information about new products. In many instances,  \r\n        purchasing a new product requires a clear explanation of the value proposition. \r\n\u2022\tAccess to finance: many clean energy technologies are only affordable through credit mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help Juhudi Kilimo, with the assistance and technical support of MEC, to address these barriers by connecting Juhudi to clean energy suppliers and carbon finance.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be repaid by MEC on behalf of Juhudi Kilimo with carbon offset revenues, and also by the margin that MEC will earn from purchasing technologies from clean energy suppliers. Loan repayments will come from MEC\u2019s profits.

Alphaxard has been a member of this group for the past three years and has benefited from learning about various ways of improving farming methods.

Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

It was her husband who taught her how to farm the land. He is a blacksmith and farmer and more than 10 years ago taught her how to grow corn, beans and yucca. This is the main source of income for her family and household.\r\n\r\nLesly has three young children. One of them is at pre-school but the other two are too young to go to school. Her plans for the future are to grow coffee next year and concentrate on this crop since the profits are better. She plans to have a coffee nursery and try to sell the product with added value. This is one of the ideas which she and her husband have for generating more profits. They hope to increase their corn, bean and yucca crops and have improved sales of these in the coming year. She helps her husband making horse shoes, machetes, mattocks and other items so they can have as much income as possible for the wellbeing and schooling of their children so they can be well educated.\r\n\r\nLesly has asked the COMIXMUL cooperative for a loan to buy agricultural supplies so she can tend her corn crop and also buy yucca shoots to plant. By doing this she hopes to have a bigger and good quality harvest to sell next season.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1490639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

He drives a fixed-route taxi.  He has been in this business for 2 years.  His current vehicle has room for 7 passengers.  He wants to buy a \"Gazelle\" brand vehicle that has seats for more passengers.  Since he doesn't have enough money for this purchase, he has decided to take out a loan.

He was always drawn to eastern cooking, loved the delicious dishes and most importantly the useful nutrients. Over time, Burhon's desires and interests have been fulfilled in his activities. He began to produce and sell our national dishes. Similarly, Burhon makes all of our famous, beloved traditional \"sambusu\" (meat pies), which he bakes in a special tandoor ovens. His wife helps him in this work. But for preparing sambusu, Burhon does not trust anyone; he prepares those himself. Customers are very pleased and glad that even in their village such a place can be found, where one can get a quick and tasty snack. <br \/><br \/>Burhon's work went well, and the business is slowly developing. Burhon first of all thanks MDO Arvand. Since he took money in a loan, he started his own business and has been working with this organization for two years. Here again Burhon wants to take a loan to purchase a few bags of flour and butter.

All her children are married and are migrant workers in Russia except for her oldest, who lives with her and helps her with her daily chores.  Her other children periodically send money back home to help support their mother.  She has the equivalent of a high school education, and is a crop- and livestock farmer.  She first started raising livestock 34 years ago with 3,000 som worth of animals, and, thanks to her persistence, currently has 2 dairy cows and 2 hectares of land for growing corn and clover (which she uses to feed her cows), while her monthly income has risen to nearly 15,000 som.\r\n\r\nTo further develop her farm, Kanzada is seeking a loan from Bai Tushum & Partners to buy some bull calves, which she plans on raising and fattening to resell at a profit.  She hopes to use any future profits due to the loan to continue to buy even more livestock for her farm.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1508519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy cattle for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Savay village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-12T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-11T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanzada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7553},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7421},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7806},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7796},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8043},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8186},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8430},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8595},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8807},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9046},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":9247},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":9070}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.57},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":644707,"name":"Mwanahijah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanahijah is a married woman with four school going children.

However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Elmira was able to run her pharmacy business in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. \r\n\r\nThe second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. \r\nThis loan will greatly assist Elmira to sustain her pharmacy and make it more profitable.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":104,"image":{"id":1489419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for medication to sell in her small pharmacy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Yerevan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-13T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-11T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":108}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104,"local_amount":104,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439846144,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T23:31:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":644731,"name":"Shah  Gul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shah Gul is a 27-year-old married woman and the mother of three children.

She married Jeenbekov right after finishing school, and together they started working with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. They started 13 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zinat's persistent work, her farm currently has a dairy cow, three sheep, three lambs and also a plot of land of 0.80 hectares, on which she grows beans and clover. The monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zinat turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase calves to increase the number of livestock.

Her salary, however, is not enough to effectively meet her family's needs. To be able to cover those needs, Anahit is also engaged in breeding livestock (a cow and a pig), in beekeeping and in the cultivation of potatoes. She sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is a very important source of the family's income. Her daughter assists her greatly in everyday activities related to farming. \r\n\r\nAnahit currently needs to make some investments in her agribusiness in order for it to function in a sustained way. She needs a loan of USD 600 to purchase forage (grass and barley) for the livestock. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during recent times, Anahit was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

That's how she started studying technical marketing and sales. The owner of the bookstore congratulated her for wanting to be successful and he allowed her to continue working part-time. As a result, her income was no longer the same. The girl completed a portion of the program, reaching the part that required her to do an internship.

Now she sees that the first of many goals is very near, and the next step is to continue with her level of professionalism and manage to open her own office."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":1487455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for education costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-12-13T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-11T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yeni Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":840000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":145368.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439696797,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-15T00:49:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645583,"name":"Sindy Pamela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sindy, tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, tiene un hijo y vive en el municipio de Olanchito, Yoro.

It is composed of eleven female entrepreneurs, who are engaged in various commercial ventures such as the sale of clothing, cosmetics and perfumes, the manufacture of shoes, and the operation of small shops selling useful items for daily consumption.\r\n\r\nFlorinda is a 47-year-old member of the Vida Trust Bank group. She is married with five children. Along with her husband, Florinda owns a shoe workshop and has seven employees. Four of the employees are family members and two are employees who live nearby. With the year-end holidays quickly approaching, Florinda anticipates increased business. She is applying for a new loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to buy material to make shoes. Florinda, along with her husband are pleased to access this vital financial capital so that they can purchase additional supplies. As with almost all of the clients of Friendship Bridge, the greatest hope that Florinda has is to see her children continue with their education and hopefully, graduate from college. She realizes they will enjoy more opportunities with increased education.\r\n\r\nAll of the women in the Vida Trust Bank group appreciate the confidence of KIVA investors.

frail woman with a strong spirit and the firmness of a man. After her husband's illness she discovered her strength, didn't give in, and set her children on their feet. It was very hard for her at first, since she couldn't find work because she lacks a college education. But she gathered her strength and decided to be a small scale entrepreneur. First she became a seller of household items. Then she started working at the same time as a janitor in a school. Her grown children also help their mother and each other. To help her son with his work, Sanoat decided to buy him a car. Her son plans to work mornings and evenings as a transport driver of sausage products, and during the day as a taxi driver. Sanoat came to MDO Arvand for help with this goal. She very much hopes for and trusts the support she receives through Arvand."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1504666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

her spouse. Her husband is a club manager and has a steady income from his salary. Janarkul has a high school education. She takes an optimistic view on life, knowing exactly what she wants and using all her abilities to get there. Janarkul knows how to use and manage money to reach a goal. Janarkul practices animal husbandry to earn the primary income for her family. She started 20 years ago with the purchase of 5,000 som KGS worth of animals. Thanks to her tireless work she now has two horses, two dairy cows, three calves, 10 sheep, and nine goats. She has everything needed to keep animals: a barn to keep them in and pasture. The diary cows are always kept near the house and the family looks after them themselves. The sheep are taken to pasture from March to October by a shepherd. Hay and feed for the animals are readied in sufficient amounts. Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop the business Janarkul asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a horse to increase her livestock herd. She plans to use income from use of the loan to invest in further increasing her number of livestock, and she also plans to save some for her oldest daughter to attend college to study education, since the daughter is finishing high school this year and plans to go to college.

This will allow her to have a greater variety of products to offer, thereby satisfying the tastes and requirements of her clientele and obtaining an increase in sales and earnings.\r\n\r\nRosa shows that despite her advanced age, she has not stopped dreaming and she wants to continue working hard so she can set up her own store, in which she would offer merchandise, and be able to enjoy a better quality of life with her children. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1509820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase stock wholesale (clothes and accessories)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-01-12T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-11T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":54695},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":56208},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":57762},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":59360},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":61002},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":62690},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64424},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66206},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68037},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":69919},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":71853},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":73841},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75883},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":77982},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":80138}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T20:23:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
