She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought for cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php21,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPerla fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day and hopes to grow her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She's an energetic woman, an experienced entrepreneur, and very ambitious. She's 40 years old and the mother of seven children, out of whom two are twins.\n\nShe runs a shop in downtown Goma. Her husband is a banker with a banking and real-estate company. She started her business after getting married, by selling small items to her peers.\n\nShe's been running her business for 13 years. On a regular basis, she gets a loan from Kiva's partner, Hekima, in order to bolster her business. Her profits are used for savings, for food, and to help cover her children's school expenses.\n\nShe just received her sixth loan. During the last loan cycle, her business thrived significantly. Consequently, she decided to seek a bigger loan for this new cycle. She will use her new loan to buy 50 dozen layettes in Kampala.   \n\nIn addition, she would like to see her children grow and surprise her husband by offering him a car. She thanks Hekima for its actions aimed at making low-income women self-sustaining."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1073079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy 50 dozen layettes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo","town":"Goma, North Kivu province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"0 25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":160,"posted_date":"2012-04-18T12:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-18T12:50:04Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3085,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":192.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":192.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.81,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276681863,"comment":null},{"amount":774.99,"local_amount":771.24,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":774.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283169641,"comment":null},{"amount":975.96,"local_amount":971.24,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":975.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287068096,"comment":null},{"amount":767.76,"local_amount":764.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":767.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294370289,"comment":null},{"amount":387.54,"local_amount":385.66,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":387.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301423646,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-19T14:30:20Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:22:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":414307,"name":"Erminia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Erminia, a 36-year-old resident of Quezon city, Philippines, is married to Nestor, a vendor.

is Noemi, 57, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. Single, she manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNoemi oversees operations of the jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has a jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. She earns PHP1000 everyday.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new tires for the jeepneys, and other maintenance needs for her vehicle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNoemi dreams of growing her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn. They modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

His rolling store is basically a small household products store, which retails plastic containers, dippers, pails, plastic flowers or basins to the local neighborhood. He drives the rolling store within the local community to sell the products. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy pails, plastic ware, hangers, clothes pins, plastic flowers and other items to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.\r\n\r\nRodolfo hopes that his business will continue to be successful and he dreams of giving his children a bright future. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She is a spirited woman who has been working in the trade sector since 2000. She started her business selling fish and vegetables at the local market. When she would get home, her neighbours would seek her out to buy the leftover condiments that she would bring home with her. This ultimately made her decide to set up a table outside her home to sell condiments; this would allow her to reclaim all the customers in the area.\r\n\r\nNdondy is part of a group of which she has been the chairwoman. She therefore has experience in the area of credit. This time, she wishes to get a loan of 75 000 francs with which to buy some palm oil to resell in the neighbourhood and on the table in front of her house.\r\n\r\nNdondy is married and the mother of a family. She supports her husband, also a trader, with the management of their daily expenses. She is in charge of paying the water and electricity bills.

estudiando. Ella se dedica al comercio de tienda desde hace mucho tiempo. Teresa se caracteriza por ser una mujer trabajadora, honesta y con muchos deseos de superarse. Para ella lo m\u00e1s importante es su familia. No pierde las esperanzas de alg\u00fan d\u00eda ver a su hija convertida en una profesional y con mejores oportunidades de vida a las que ella tuvo acceso. Esto es lo que inspira a Teresa a trabajar duramente en su tienda  que con mucho esfuerzo ha logrado establecer. Tiene mucho tiempo de dedicarse al negocio por lo que ya logr\u00f3 ganarse la confianza de muchas personas. El objetivo de Teresa  es surtir su negocio de tal manera que la capacidad del mismo sea m\u00e1s grande y logre cubrir una mayor demanda. Esta inversi\u00f3n piensa hacerla por medio de un cr\u00e9dito ya que no cuenta con los recursos propios necesarios para hacerlo. Es por esta raz\u00f3n que ha decidido solicitar este cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para comprar los productos necesarios (arroz, frijoles, pan dulce, galletas, dulces, golosinas, detergente, aceite, etc.) para mantener surtido su negocio y que le permitan alcanzar su objetivo de cubrir una mayor demanda de tal forma que sus ventas e ingresos se vean incrementados y poder as\u00ed dar a su familia diferentes oportunidades de vida. Tiene mucha confianza de alcanzar el objetivo trazado ya que es una mujer perseverante y siempre logra lo que se propone. La se\u00f1ora Teresa expresa estar muy agradecida con esta instituci\u00f3n ya que en el pasado solicito un pr\u00e9stamo y le brindaron la ayuda que tanto necesitaba, gracias a ello y su excelente administraci\u00f3n creci\u00f3 su negocio, espera que al igual que en el pasado le otorguen este cr\u00e9dito que tanta falta le hace para desarrollar mas su negocio. \n\n","en":"Teresa del Carmen, 51, lives in the family home with her 16 year old daughter who is a student.  She has been a merchant for a long time.  Teresa is noted for being a hardworking, honest woman who very much wants to get ahead.  For her, her family is most important.  She does not lose hope of someday seeing her daughter become a great professional with better life opportunities than she had access to.  \r\n\r\nThis is what motivates Teresa to work hard in her store which she\u2019s managed to set up with much effort.  She\u2019s been in business for a long time so she\u2019s won over the trust of many people.  Teresa\u2019s goal is to stock the store in such a way that its capacity will be larger and she can meet greater demand.  She plans to make this investment through a loan since she does not have means of her own to do so.\r\n\r\nBecause of this she\u2019s decided to request this loan from INTEGRAL to buy the needed products (rice, beans, sweet bread, cookies, candy, snacks, detergent, oil, etc.) to keep her store well-stocked so that she can reach her objective of meeting a greater demand so that sales and income will increase and she can give her family different life opportunities.\r\n\r\nShe is very confident that she will reach the set goal because she\u2019s a persevering woman who always reaches what she sets out to.  Teresa says that she\u2019s very grateful to the institution because she asked for a loan in the past and they gave her the support she so needed.  Thanks to it and to the excellent way she handled it, her business grew.  She hopes that the same way it was in the past this loan that she needs so much to develop her business more will be granted too.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1064727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is a resident of Litein in South Rift, Kenya. He is the father of four children who are aged between nineteen and twelve. The youngest three are still schooling. He is himself aged forty-eight and has been in active farming for ten years. He gets additional income from his work as a security officer in a nearby secondary school.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP worth sachet of cooking oil or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked viand in her store. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRochelle hopes her business will grow in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1070060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-18T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-18T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rochel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":541.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":3250.02,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3468.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606764,"comment":null},{"amount":67.71,"local_amount":2707.98,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2890.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095620,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":2167.05,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2312.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359230,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":2166.95,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2312.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303047,"comment":null},{"amount":67.71,"local_amount":2708,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355809,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-18T23:53:38Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":414652,"name":"Stellar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stella is a 33-year-old, businesswoman.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nKristina hopes her business would grow in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

This place is known for being a very commercial area, for its traditional San Pedro and San Pablo festivals, and for the rich historic culture that its mountains surround.\r\n\r\nThis is a group of people who decided to join together and form this communal bank, which has served them well. They are in their second cycle in the communal bank, and they tell us that the previous loan helped them a lot. This is why there are more people who joined in this cycle hoping to have success with the loans. The majority of the group were able to improve their businesses and their lives, since with the earnings they were able to make improvements to their homes as well as helping their children's educations. They engage in various activities such as business, services, and food sales, among others.\r\n\r\nIn this place we meet Mariuxi, 23 years old. She is single and lives with her parents and various younger siblings.\r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working young woman who works in business in order to earn something on her own and to be able to help her parents with the household expenses.  Monday through Saturday she works in a store in the center of the city where they sell shoes.

Even though it is a small community, the people are very hardworking. This group decided to unite to be able to undertake productive activities.\r\n\r\nThe names of the members and their respective business activities are the following:\r\n1.- Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngela B. (buy soft drinks and sweets to sell)\r\n2.- Mar\u00eda Bonifacia G. (buy napkins, tablecloths, and thread, to embroider and sell)\r\n3.- Victoria S. (buy fruits and vegetables to sell)\r\n4.- Alejandra M. (buy five sheep to sell)\r\n5.- Mar\u00eda S. (buy two sheep to sell)\r\n6.- Mar\u00eda del Carmen S. (buy groceries to sell)\r\n7.- Ma. Elena T. (buy groceries to sell\r\n8.- Virginia M. (buy groceries to sell)\r\n9.- Catalina R. (buy groceries to sell\r\n10.- Rosaura L. (buy four sheep to raise and sell)\r\n11.- Celia C. (buy groceries to sell)\r\n12.- Juana M. (buy sweets to sell)\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Victoria is a 39-year-old woman who went to school through the sixth year of primary school and works in her home. She is the representative of this group and was married 15 years ago to Se\u00f1or Doroteo. Together they have 3 children, ages 15, 11, and 9, who are now in school. Se\u00f1ora Victoria is a client of FRAC and is very responsible and optimistic. She is applying for this loan because her work is selling fruits and vegetables. On this occasion she will buy red tomatoes, green tomatoes, chiles, onions, potatoes, nopal (cactus), bananas, and mangoes. She buys her fruit every 8 days in a town called Atlacomulco, and she takes it to her house where she sells it, or she goes out to offer it door to door. She had the idea to begin this business to help with the school expenses and support of her children, since for the moment her husband is not with her. She has two years of experience in this business, and she comments that it has gone very well for her, and the only problem that she has had in developing her business is an illness in her feet that makes her very tired when she walks around to offer her fruits and vegetables. She says that the loan will help her a lot since she will invest it and get earnings that will help her quite a bit with her expenses. In the future Se\u00f1ora Victoria would like to buy a means of transportation which will make transport of her products easier and won't cause soreness in her feet.

One of the members is Carmen, a humble and hardworking woman who is 58 years old and who has made a living selling bread for a year.  \r\n\r\nCarmen Cleof\u00e1s tells us that she has two employees who make the bread and she just buys the ingredients, since she is ill and gets injured when she gets close to the heat of the oven.  But she is proud of her employees because they complete the orders on time and avoid disappointing her customers.\r\n\r\nCarmen Cleof\u00e1s is happily married to Pablo, who is 53 years old.  She says she is happy that her husband treats her well in spite of the fact that he is younger than she is.

Carmen is happy with her business as it allows for a good income and also her customers really like her bread.\r\n\r\nShe has three children: Pedro Paulo, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel y Emili, who help increase her business and she is happy with the extra income.\r\nShe asked for the loan to buy more ingredients for making bread, such as:  yeast, Royal brand baking powder, sugar, flour, margarine, eggs and butter.\r\n\r\nCarmen tells us that she is very happy with the support that the foundation has given her and her fellow members so that they can change their lives.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan.

She was able to finish high school, paying for it with money that she earned working as a helper to her aunt, who is a seamstress. She is single and does not have any children. When she was in high school her mother passed away and her father decided not to continue helping her pay for her studies. The only support she had while studying came from her aunts and uncles. Later on she decided to travel to where one of her uncles lives in Brazil, to stop studying to be able to continue working as a seamstress and in this way earn an income. She has since returned from Brazil and now lives with her aunt and uncle, to whom she pays rent. Since she has experience in the work of a seamstress, she is partnering with her aunt to open a business in Cochabamba. Amanda is requesting the loan to buy sewing machines, so that she has her own equipment. This will allow her to have improved income and she is considering continuing to study later on down the road.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1066627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy sewing machines.

is Hilda, 38, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. Her husband and business partner is Cyril. She is the mother of two children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nHilda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 39,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nHilda hopes her business will grow in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

is Salvacion, 49, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Pepito, her business partner. She is a mother of two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n                            \r\nSalvacion operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She sells meat for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSalvacion hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

first business was selling fish, which she did for almost one year. According to Leonila, she didn't continue this business due to the many credit sales on which she was unable to collect payment. Her situation during that time was difficult, but since she joined ASKI she has been eager to obtain success in life. As the days passed by, she became involved in the hog-raising business. In the hog business, her income increased, and this enabled her to start a sewing business. Leonila couldn't really explain what she felt at that time because, after the suffering she had undergone, the sun was still shining and she was achieving success in life.\n\nAt this time, Leonila runs her sewing business. At her age--64 years old--she is still able to sew different kinds of curtains, pants, pillowcases, blouses, and short pants. She really enjoys running her business because she is able to earn approximately 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). This is really a big blessing to her because she can cover all her household expenses and provide feed for her hogs. As a responsible borrower, Leonila has maintained a good track record and is now asking for a bigger loan of 30,000 PHP so she can buy stock garments, thread, and other materials needed in her sewing business. She hopes to have continued access to the financial services of ASKI to be able to improve her living conditions and her financial

She raises chickens and grows vegetables and fruit for sale. Earlier Tsoghik also raised pigs, but due to last year's pig disease in the Syunik region, she does not have any pigs left. Tsoghik sells the resulting products - eggs, vegetables and fruits -  in Kapan and Kajaran. \r\n\r\nTsoghik is 45 years old. She lives in Kapan. Tsoghik is married and has three children: Two daughters and one son. The daughters are already married and live separately from their parents, and the son currently lives in Russia. Tsoghik's husband works as a driver in one of Kapan's organizations and at the same time helps his wife with the farming, thanks to which they support the family. \r\n\r\nTsoghik wants to resume the raising of pigs, since it is very profitable. For this, Tsoghik needs a loan in the sum of 550,000 dram, which she will spend on buying some piglets."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1072940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

This institute was founded in 1993. Teachers of the institute have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan. They requested a loan of 16,800,000 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) for the entire group.
