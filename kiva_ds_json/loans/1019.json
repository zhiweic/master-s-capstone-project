What is more, she is cheerful and friendly.  She is a widow and the children she had with her late husband are now independent.  It was for their sake that she strove to succeed in the face of adversity and it was the fruits of these efforts which enabled her to buy her own home, where she lives comfortably along with her tenants.\r\n\r\nCelina's business is selling dried hirapay (an Amazonian palm) leaves which are used for roofing houses.  She stores them in her house and sells them in the street on the pavement of the busy road.  Her customers visit her to obtain these leaves, which are in great demand, and because of the good service which she provides.  She set up her business over a year ago with a personal loan and, so far, has been able to rely on the help of her children and one other person whom she pays weekly.  She considers her business to be quite profitable on account of the earnings which it brings in.  Furthermore, she says that she got the idea of starting the business from her partner, who organises the harvesting of the leaves from the rain forest, and saw that it made higher profits.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, having seen the good results she has achieved, she plans to continue and increase her investment in the business.  This will involve obtaining a sixth loan from MFP, whose support she believes she can count on to pursue her goals.

She lives in a civil union with Misael, who is thirty-two. They have two children, Milena and Juan. Thanks to her constant efforts, together with her husband, Marisol managed to buy a house made of wood. After graduating as a nurse in the city, she decided to come back to her hometown in order to help people. She has been working at the public health centre in Santa Rosa for seven years, honouring her promise to herself by being an active participant in her town's social development. As she is very dedicated to her work, she also helps sometimes at private health centres and clinics of her area, which helps her generate more income, which goes toward household expenses. Following her business instincts, she decided to start selling shoes from a catalogue. Her idea is to sell them to colleagues and to the other professionals she works with on a regular basis. In order to do that, she wants working capital with which to buy the first bulk of shoes as well as the catalogues, an activity that would generate additional income. In the future, Marisol would like to open a pharmacy, in order to keep helping people protect their health while generating more income to give her little ones a brighter future. This would be her fourth loan. Her sparing no efforts means that her position is stable and that she can count on her monthly salary to reimburse her loans seamlessly. Marisol feels a strong bond with the other members of her communal bank and says that everyone trusts each other. With this loan, she will buy shoes to sell from a catalogue and start her business in this field."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1257692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy shoes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":159.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":175.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":180.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":186.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":186.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":199.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":202.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":210.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.62,"local_amount":159.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":163.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189090,"comment":null},{"amount":70.02,"local_amount":175.06,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":179.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573025,"comment":null},{"amount":72.33,"local_amount":180.82,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":185.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122667,"comment":null},{"amount":74.71,"local_amount":186.77,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":191.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868493,"comment":null},{"amount":74.48,"local_amount":186.22,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":190.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577324,"comment":null},{"amount":79.62,"local_amount":199.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":204.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529565,"comment":null},{"amount":80.86,"local_amount":202.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":207.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974623,"comment":null},{"amount":84.36,"local_amount":210.91,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":216.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996026,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T15:19:30Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508464,"name":"Jacqueline Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jacqueline 29 a\u00f1os de edad, originaria de Managua, casada, madre de 1 hijo de 5 a\u00f1os, el cual cursa el preescolar de primaria, de oficio comerciante.

Lazar has had a lot of experience working on his land for many years.\r\nHe is planning to buy tractor and other tools to start his business working on the land of others. In this way, according to him, he can earn a lot of income. In his village there is a very big demand for people to work on the land with a tractor and they always pay for this service. Now Lazar is requesting a loan in order to buy a tractor. The loan will help him to start his business, which will allow him to earn an income for living expenses. He hopes in the future to expand his business to buy more tractors and to hire employees to work for him. His goal is to save money for his future and to get married. He wants to thank all Kiva lenders who are helping him to start his

His life partner Corina is 23, and he wants to start a home, though he does not have children now. Thanks to their hard work, they have completed the first floor of their house with good materials. As a child, his parents taught him how to farm and, in particular, to grow organic cacao. Later, he decided to farm on his own, and 11 years ago he acquired land that he now works with Corina and is the main source of their income. \r\n\r\nTo increase their earnings, they have focused on producing cacao: removing weeds and fermenting and drying it. Weed removal is the most important task, since it is critical to keep the weeds from absorbing the nutrients in the soil. Evaluating the soil to determine the best organic fertilizer to use is necessary, and island bird guano is one of the best suited to the regional soils. Since Rober has a large area to cultivate, he wants to hire day laborers, and he will also spread organic fertilizer to ensure a quality crop. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet his goals and provide a brighter future for his children, Rober needs working capital. With this motivation, he expects to get ahead and continue to work hard. The 1,500 nuevos soles he has requested will be used to removed weeds with the help of the day workers and to buy sacks of organic bird fertilizer to ensure a quality crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1257724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire day laborers and to buy sacks of organic bird fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T17:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T17:20:12Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rober ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":159.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":175.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":180.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":186.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":186.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":199.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":202.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":210.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.62,"local_amount":159.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":163.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189091,"comment":null},{"amount":70.02,"local_amount":175.06,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":179.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573026,"comment":null},{"amount":72.33,"local_amount":180.82,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":185.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122668,"comment":null},{"amount":74.71,"local_amount":186.77,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":191.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868494,"comment":null},{"amount":74.48,"local_amount":186.22,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":190.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577325,"comment":null},{"amount":79.62,"local_amount":199.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":204.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529566,"comment":null},{"amount":80.86,"local_amount":202.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":207.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974624,"comment":null},{"amount":84.36,"local_amount":210.91,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":216.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996027,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T14:12:55Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508347,"name":"Efua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Efua sells cassava, plantain and vegetables at Besease near Elmina.

is 61 years old and lives in the Chokhatauri District with his wife Julieta.

The only source of income the family has is the small monthly salary Julieta earns by working as a teacher at the village school. The family earns a total of 150 GEL per month, which is barely enough to provide food for a two-preson family. According to Credo, the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nJumberi is requesting a loan from Credo to re-start a family business which he had to stop due to financial problems. He will use his loan to buy rabbits and begin working in animal husbandry. He will buy cages for rabbits to live in and sell their meat, which is in high demand locally. Jumberi's loan request was reviewed within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program helps people begin businesses with convenient credit terms that are ideal for the rural poor who do not have access to the usual sources of credit. Jumberi believes that his new business, financed with this Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1257483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to start an animal-husbandry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Amaghleba","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jumberi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":137.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":153.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":162.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":162.51},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":168.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":172.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":182.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":187.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":193.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":198.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":204.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.67,"local_amount":137.81,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":139.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339566030,"comment":null},{"amount":93.15,"local_amount":153.43,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":154.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115603,"comment":null},{"amount":98.88,"local_amount":162.86,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":164.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861083,"comment":null},{"amount":98.67,"local_amount":162.51,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":164.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569888,"comment":null},{"amount":102.33,"local_amount":168.55,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":170.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968525,"comment":null},{"amount":104.45,"local_amount":172.02,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":173.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748943,"comment":null},{"amount":108.07,"local_amount":178.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":179.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612854,"comment":null},{"amount":110.54,"local_amount":182.06,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":183.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856596,"comment":null},{"amount":475.24,"local_amount":782.75,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":790.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133280,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T22:47:30Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T15:57:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508488,"name":"Cruz Jaime","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cruz Jaime de cincuenta y tres a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1era de vida  y su hija en casa propia.

is from Batumi. She is 40 years old, married, and lives with her husband and 20-year-old daughter. Her husband works as a guard and her daughter is a shop consultant. Both of her family members earn a monthly salary. \r\n\r\nShe has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for starting a business, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected every time because of her low income and the lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nNino used to have a vet shop, which was stopped because of financial problems. She requested a loan from Credo to start a small business. Her loan request was approved via the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program includes business start-up and re-startup loans with conditions appropriate for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nNino already has obtained a building for the grocery store in the basement of 5-story building. With the loan, she will purchase inventory, as well as refrigerators for the store and meet her first customers. She will sell a variety of grocery products and is sure that the store will function profitably, as there are no similar stores nearby. The new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs, in order to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1273.99,"image":{"id":1257498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She sells fried products, soft drinks and sweets in a kiosk.  Her experience with this business dates back two years, as she started it in the year 2010 when her husband was unemployed.  They both decided to use savings, the product of his severance pay, in the purchase of a kiosk and to begin their own adventure of generating income independently.  Initially, they bought a refrigerator and sold drinks and fried foods in a small quantity.  With what she earned from the sales she would reinvest to buy a greater assortment.  Hers is a family business, all the members of the family attend to it and little by little it has been growing up to the point that they are producers in greater volume.  Previously they bought fried foods from third parties, but as of today they make the fried foods themselves daily, having a great reception for being located in a strategic place in front of a large school, where their customers include the students from that educational institution, teachers and also the neighbors of the area.  They come to the kiosk and request the product that they want, especially in mid-morning, at lunch time, mid-afternoon and into the evening.  So, the clientele is abundant throughout the day.\r\n\r\nThe loveliest time of the year is approaching for families, Christmas and the New Year, and the clientele of Aurora will deservedly celebrate with unity in their homes.  They will spend what is necessary to feel happy.  For that reason Aurora will offer products associated with the time of year like desserts, sweets and drinks and she will need a larger inventory of packaged food products like potato chips, cheese snacks and cookies.  Faced with the prospect of increasing her sales, her working capital isn\u2019t sufficient to invest as she needs to, for that reason it becomes a great challenge and she is turning to a Kiva loan, her second financing with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to invest it in the purchase of a greater number of sweets and desserts to stock the business.  She also wants to diversify, selling lunches and special dishes.  They hope that the loan will help them to increase their sales, to be able to satisfy the demand of their customers and to earn more money that will benefit their home, as she has family dreams to fulfill that have to do with her four children.  She wants them to be able to continue studying and to continue moving forward in life, so that it is very successful."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":527.34,"image":{"id":1257679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sweets, drinks and ingredients for lunches for her kiosk.

age 31, earns a living for her family by operating a small restaurant along Rubaga Road on the outskirts of the city of Kampala.

Jamidah\u2019s major clients are motorcycle taxi drivers, builders, and passers-by along the road. She offers special chicken dishes during festive seasons.\r\n\r\nJamidah lives on Rubaga Road with her husband and their three children, all of whom are enrolled in school.\r\n\r\nJamidah aspires toward having enough capital to own and operate a standard restaurant in a permanent building in a decent area. This would allow her to increase her income, as the prices in a nicer place would be better and she could earn more revenue than in a temporary structure. She also dreams of having a better home for her family and educating her children at good schools up to higher levels of education.\r\n\r\nHer major challenge is lack of capital, which slows down the growth of her business. This affects not only her business but also her family\u2019s standard of living.\r\n\r\nJamidah is very hard-working, sociable, and honest.

Christmas and the New Year are very fast approaching and she needs to stock up her store with everything that is needed during this season, so that she can increase her sales as she does every year. Since she knows her business and each season's highest selling time very well, she keeps it well-stocked during each season. She has been doing this since 2008, when she first went into business with a general store. She used to own a hair salon where she provided her customers with beauty and personal image enhancement services. Later on, she gradually observed the market trends and opened the stationery store, which currently meets the demands from her neighborhood and other neighboring areas. She currently needs to stock up her business much more and her working capital is not enough to achieve that. That's the reason why she's requesting a Kiva loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She'll use it to purchase footwear, flip-flops and stationery items. Her main goal is to expand her business. For that reason she works hard from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Sunday, in order to accomplish her dream of seeing her family prosper."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1257819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase footwear, flip-flops and stationery items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":98092},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":112048},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":114662},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":117338},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":120076},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":122877},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125745},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":128679},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131681},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":134754},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137898},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":156150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.59,"local_amount":98092,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":99889.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519802,"comment":null},{"amount":794.41,"local_amount":1401908,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1427601.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817056,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T02:53:32Z","paid_date":"2013-09-19T08:52:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508548,"name":"Shikana Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Doroth\u00e9e fait partie du groupe  Shikana  et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is a training grounds for many of Kenya's Olympic runners. She has three children and has been working in agriculture for 15 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops. Esther says what is most enjoyable about farming is: \"Poultry keeping!\" Her biggest challenge is \"poor pricing of farm products within the local markets.\"\r\n\r\nEsther was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Because they deal with farmers and I am a farmer.\"  She was also asked what she learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, and she said: \"To develop a savings culture.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Esther replied \"More income'\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Esther owns the following: \"cow, poultry,\" but does not own \"pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.\" Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and sent the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

He lives in Barranquilla, a city on the Colombian Caribbean coast where it\u2019s hot year-round which is why his products are always in demand.  He worked in a frozen treat factory for more than 10 years and in 2004 decided to leave that job to start his own business.  \r\n\r\nEverything has turned out well for him these last 8 years so he\u2019s very excited and starts work every day at 6am buying ingredients at large commercial establishments and also in small local markets.  For the moment, Jorge sells directly to the final consumer but his business goal is to increase production and sell to supermarkets becoming one of their major suppliers.  For him, publicizing his business has been difficult but he hopes that by applying for Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo loans he will be able to expand production and win over more customers.  This is why he\u2019s now applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing with this institution that he will use to buy larger amounts of ingredients like whole, liquid milk, sugar, natural flavoring agents and butter.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he will start to increase production and will also increase his income because he\u2019ll have more working capital for his purchases and personal capacity for work and to produce.  Jorge is the father of two daughters aged 15 and 19 and he wants to give them and his wife everything in his reach to make them very happy now and in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1257828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

lives in the Nanyuki area of Central province, Kenya. He is married and has four children. He owns a tea tree farming business. Charles started the business with income from subsistence farming. He also grows potatoes, maize, and vegetables on a small scale. The extract from tea trees is used to manufacture cosmetics.\r\n\r\nCharles learned about Milango through an employee who invited him to the group and he joined the group with the aim of accessing credit.

She sells candy directly to customers but she now has links to a business through which she will sell with product specialists.  Her biggest group of customers are in the south west of the city where Ana lives with her family.  Her goals are to increase her working capital so that she has a bigger income, which she saves with her husband's, and to make sure that her children have a good education and are successful.  With Christmas and New Year approaching, so is the season of Christmas bonuses and there are special offers available so that families and friends can buy very inexpensive gifts for all their loved ones.  Ana has visited her customers who have ordered a good number of candies but Ana does not have enough working capital to cover demand.  She is applying for a loan to buy candy in pretty packaging, which her customers will share with close family and friends.  She will also buy clothes so that the families look elegant at parties.  With this investment, Ana will increase her working capital by taking advantage of the season when the consumption of many items increases and when there is a lot of money going about.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1257867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy candy in pretty packaging and clothes for families to look elegant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T21:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T21:00:23Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39916},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45903},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":46974},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48070},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":49191},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50339},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51514},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52716},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53946},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61431}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.95,"local_amount":39916,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":43038.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519805,"comment":null},{"amount":27.54,"local_amount":45903,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":49493.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071636,"comment":null},{"amount":28.19,"local_amount":46974,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50648.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497851,"comment":null},{"amount":28.84,"local_amount":48070,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":51830.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527661,"comment":null},{"amount":29.51,"local_amount":49191,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":53039.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928415,"comment":null},{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":50339,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":54276.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705567,"comment":null},{"amount":30.9,"local_amount":51514,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":55543.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967857,"comment":null},{"amount":31.63,"local_amount":52716,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":56839.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817060,"comment":null},{"amount":69.23,"local_amount":115377,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":124402.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323338,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T00:16:19Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:53:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508558,"name":"O\u00f1ondivepa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 lleva por nombre O\u00f1ondivepa, que significa todas juntas, y es que son 15 mujeres de la ciudad de San Lorenzo que trabajan juntas para poder salir adelante y ayudarse las unas a las otras.\nLiz, la presidenta es parte de este grupo, comenta ella que siempre tiene muy buena predisposici\u00f3n para poder ayudar a sus amigas y que siempre las anima a seguir trabajando.

Many of her clients are her neighbors and women who live near her region.  She tries to give the highest level of service so as to attract many clients.  Thanks to her good service, she has a wide range of clients.  She uses the income from her business to support her family.

The elder two children are in high school and the younger one is in kindergarten.  Rahmatjon's wife is a homemaker and this is why he is the only breadwinner in the family.  He always tries to provide for his family's needs.  Rahmatjon started his business in baked goods - he worked as a bread driver - and now he works as an installer of aluminum composites.  His colleagues know him as a kind and hard-working man and they value his friendship because Rahmatjon is a true friend.  He uses his salary to support his family and provide for their needs.  Since his children are in high school, they need a computer, just as Rahmatjon himself needs it for his work.  He is asking for a loan of 500 US dollars to buy a computer.  This loan will help him increase his children's level of technological knowledge.  He has many plans for his future and he is trying to make them all happen.

is an entrepreneur who works with a small team of socially minded partners to improve lives for farmers throughout Kenya. Her work involves training farmers and building market linkages with suppliers of environmentally friendly products that are needed within local communities. Over the last several years, Joyce has worked with thousands of low-income farmers that grow tea, coffee, flowers, and vegetables. She started Boma Safi Limited to support the many farmers who lack access to sustainable energy and products that alleviate poverty. \n\nThe Boma Safi product line now includes solar energy solutions, as well as clean cookstoves, water purifiers, and women's health products. These goods are sold directly on farms, as well as in rural open-air markets and two small shops that Joyce now operates. Boma Safi (meaning \"clean home\" in Swahili) has quickly built a reputation as a trusted voice in the East African Fair Trade community.\n\nJoyce leads a small team that conducts workshops on farms across Kenya, demonstrating the positive aspects of solar when compared to traditional energy sources such as candles, kerosene, and disposable batteries. With years of experience selling a variety of solar products, Joyce began working with One Degree\u2019s team in Kenya in 2012 after collecting feedback from farmers about BrightBox, a new solar energy kit that powers lights, phones, and radios. During workshops, farmers would exclaim \"stima!\" - meaning electricity - when seeing BrightBox lights in action, and Joyce knew she found a winning solution.\n\nSince September 2012, Joyce has already sold hundreds of BrightBox systems to farmers. She already has requests for many more, which she would like to provide before the holidays. While happy with her initial success, Joyce has been selling to farmers on a regular cash basis, while many others cannot afford to pay upfront. These same lower-income farmers are sadly stuck spending $10-$15 per month - a considerable portion of their income - on lighting and phone charging.\n\nTo break this cycle and provide renewable energy to these farmers, Joyce would like to start offering flexible payment terms to those who need it most. She seeks support from Kiva lenders to make this happen.\n\nJoyce will use funds for 150 BrightBoxes, which will be used to energize and empower farming households across the region. Farmers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them over several months. Since they are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4-5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. With your help, Joyce will help farming families eliminate energy expenses, improve safety, and allow their children to read into the night.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7500,"image":{"id":1255500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for solar energy systems and offer financing plans to lower-income farmers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Naivasha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.716667 36.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T23:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T23:00:06Z","loan_amount":7500,"lender_count":233,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":646000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":7500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":646000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":7500,"local_amount":646000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":646133.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331222536,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T01:53:58Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:26:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508553,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":210.9,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy supplies","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T23:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T23:00:07Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1,"local_amount":485.52,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":497.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373132533,"comment":null},{"amount":209.9,"local_amount":102390.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":104823.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059200,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T16:05:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508564,"name":"Elibeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nElibeth, una mujer emprendedora y muy humilde, tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y vive con dos hijos y el esposo  actualmente, ella solicito un pr\u00e9stamo con el anhelo de  comprar insumos como abonos, y fumigantes, ella desea dar asistencia a los cultivos de caf\u00e9, para obtener un producto de buena calidad y factible a la hora de ser comercializado.

In order to better do her work, though, she needs to acquire the blocks of wood ahead of time from the region\u2019s reforested forests.\r\n\r\nIn future, she\u2019d like to continue working and contracting orders to expand the business adding a store to display her furniture in.  She wants to have 2,000 new soles to buy blocks of wood to fill all her pending orders among which is one for the benches for her local park.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1257951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy wood blocks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T00:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T00:00:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":206.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":232.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":239.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":247.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":246.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":264.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":272.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":290.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.95},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":206.24,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":211.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573035,"comment":null},{"amount":92.89,"local_amount":232.23,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":238.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122677,"comment":null},{"amount":95.95,"local_amount":239.87,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":246.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868503,"comment":null},{"amount":99.1,"local_amount":247.77,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":254.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577334,"comment":null},{"amount":98.77,"local_amount":246.91,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":253.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529575,"comment":null},{"amount":105.62,"local_amount":264.05,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":270.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974633,"comment":null},{"amount":225.17,"local_amount":562.93,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":577.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996036,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T01:24:08Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508595,"name":"Trabajando Por El Futuro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Buenas Tardes!!!

","en":"Dairo has a motorcycle repair shop as well as a store selling replacement motorcycle parts located in the center of Barranquilla. Dairo is the father of two daughters, 6 and 2 years old, for whose sake he works every day from 8:00 in the morning until very late, doing maintenance and repairs on motorcycles and bicycles. \r\n\r\nDairo has 12 years of experience in the business; before he had his own shop, he worked for ten years in a warehouse that sold parts and accessories, which is how he learned how this type of small business works. Several years ago, Dairo decided to start his own business. He started out in his house, with a cash register and a table where he put the few tools he started out with, acquired with his severance pay. That went well for him, and little by little, he bought machinery and launched his business idea, which has generated income to sustain his household ever since. Currently, he offers motorcycle and bicycle repair services and sells parts and accessories for both. His customers are motorcyclists and bicycle owners from his neighborhood and nearby areas who recognize the quality of his work. \r\n\r\nWith his loan, Dairo hopes to increase his income so that he can one day expand his shop, add more display cases, and hire employees. He says that the lack of capital is the main limitation keeping him from realizing this dream; his goal for his family is to educate his daughters, turning them into professionals with successful futures. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Christmas is approaching and children and young people want to have brand new bicycles in addition to the toys that El Ni\u00f1o Dios [the Colombian equivalent of Santa Clause] is bringing. That's why he is applying for a Kiva loan, which will be his first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan, he will buy bicycle accessories like tires, tubes, and seats; with these items, he hopes to increase his sales and add to his income, taking advantage of the opportunity that exists during the Christmas season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1257762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle

Her business is selling food from her home. The funding she is requesting is for improvements to her home consisting of constructing a kitchen and changing the roof in order to provide better services to her customers. The funding will buy construction materials like: sand, zinc cement, slake lime, bricks, beams, nails and blocks. Francisca's dream is the help her son finish university.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, segundo financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1, calzado, ropa, tela, para elaborar sabanas, pues tambi\u00e9n conoce este arte y en Diciembre sus ventas de art\u00edculos de cama se incrementan. Desde hace 4 a\u00f1os cuando inici\u00f3 su negocio, su clientela ha ido creciendo, porque su experiencia le indica que clase de art\u00edculos vender en cada temporada y esto lo aprendi\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n de su madre y de su hermana que le ayudaron a iniciar este negocio. Las ventas de Carlos, las realiza una parte a cr\u00e9dito y otra de contado en periodos semanales; \u00e9l trabaja diariamente desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la tarde o m\u00e1s, si as\u00ed lo requiere su clientela. Entre sus principales clientes, est\u00e1n sus vecinos, amigos, familiares y referidos por estos, que gradualmente, han ido incrementando sus cuentas por cobrar. Con su primer cr\u00e9dito con esta organizaci\u00f3n, logr\u00f3 aumentar sus ventas y   el volumen de sus compras, ahora sus metas,  giran alrededor de tener un local propio bien posicionado , en un espacio comercial de mucha concurrencia de clientes, para cada vez mas, aumentar sus ingresos vendiendo en mayores vol\u00famenes.  ","en":"With Christmas and New Year's Eve coming up, Carlos plans to increase his shop's inventory in order to be ready for the upcoming busy season. His customers are largely comprised of neighbors, friends, relatives and others to whom he has been recommended. Some of these, he allows to make purchases on credit, and others by weekly payments. For this reason, a lack of working capital has been Carlos' biggest challenge in carrying out his plan to better stock his store.\r\n\r\nSince he opened his business four years ago, his clientele has been growing steadily. He has learned through experience and through the wisdom of his mother and sister, who helped him get started in this business, which items sell more during each season. Carlos works daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. or later if his customers require it. He makes and sells pajamas, footwear, women's accessories, and many other things customers are looking to buy in December to celebrate Christmas and the New Year with their families. That is why he is requesting this Kiva loan. It will be his second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Carlos will use this loan to buy footwear, clothing, and fabric to make sheets. His work is well-known, and in December, his bedding sales increase. With his first loan, Carlos was able to increase his sales. Now, his goals revolve around having a well-positioned business where he will attract more customers and, thus, increase his sales and revenue.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1116.81,"image":{"id":1257994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

She is married to Richard, a seaman, and a mother to her children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAmalia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices, and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmalia hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1258105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJaznalyn dreams to be able to expand soon and hopes to have a strong and healthy body. She faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1123109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He will take responsibility for the improvements by working extra hours at his job.\r\n\r\nHe plans to pay back the credit with wage he receives in his work as a security guard at a company, because the earnings his wife Esmirna obtains with her work as a seamstress and as a cleaner in various houses is for household expenses and his childrens' education. \r\n\r\nGuillermo wants his house and his family to be protected from the climate because right now it is the rainy season and the roof protects them from the humidity and diseases.\r\n\r\nHe hopes he can once again count on your cooperation for this loan because it is for the benefit of his family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1258029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to put a wooden roof on the front part of his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nuevo Laredo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"27.5 -99.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4222,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":398.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":430.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":464.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":500.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":539.95},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":582.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":628.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":677.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.07,"local_amount":398.91,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-13T09:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340193813,"comment":null},{"amount":35.67,"local_amount":430.27,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-21T08:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":454.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347054573,"comment":null},{"amount":38.47,"local_amount":464.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-25T08:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":490.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356484516,"comment":null},{"amount":41.5,"local_amount":500.59,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":529.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364508678,"comment":null},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":539.95,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":570.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372913970,"comment":null},{"amount":48.28,"local_amount":582.4,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":615.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381691678,"comment":null},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":628.19,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":664.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390794124,"comment":null},{"amount":56.17,"local_amount":677.59,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":716.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399803515,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T23:06:46Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T11:44:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508224,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is divorced and has two children.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEufrocina operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. She also sells vegetables. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nEufrocina hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams that all her children will finish their studies.

She is married to Rodolfo, a security guard and she is a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nWilma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nWilma hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life and giving her children a good education to reach their dreams.

married, and has two children.  As a source of income for her family, Ainagul is in the animal husbandry and farming businesses.  She began the animal husbandry business 10 years ago with 20,000 KGS.  She began farming after the collapse of the USSR, when the collective farms fell apart and everyone was given their own piece of land.  Today, Ainagul has one cow and 10 sheep.  She works 2.5 hectares of land where she grows beans every year.  Today, her businesses bring in about 5,000 som (KGS) per month.  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Ainagul applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of one milk cow.

After having run a number of different commercial businesses, she now sells clothing such as wax pagnes (traditional wraparound fabrics).  In order to increase her working capital and expand her business, Kadia has been working with Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution for 8 years.  She has taken out group loans with the association (which were all repaid correctly) and is now on her 11th individual loan (all her previous individual loans having been correctly repaid as well).\r\n\r\nKadia plans to use this loan to buy 60 pagnes from Lom\u00e9 (Togo).  She sells her products from home to a customer base made up primarily of women.  Her customers pay both in cash and on credit.  With this loan, Kadia will make a monthly profit of 75,000 francs which she plans to use to pay the interest charged by Soro Yiriwaso and contribute towards improving her family's living conditions.

","en":"Rajabali is a 39 year old man.  He is married and has three children.  His wife is a homemaker, takes care of their children, and sells milk.  They have a very happy family.  Rajabali and his wife try very hard to give their children everything they need. \r\n\r\nRajabali is in the animal husbandry business.  He fattens cattle at their home.  He also grows grain crops and is the chairman of the farmers' association.  Since his salary isn't enough for living, he is forced to be in the animal husbandry business.

Su meta  familiar es ofrecerle a sus hijos una educaci\u00f3n avanzada y ayudar a su esposo cada vez m\u00e1s en dar respuesta a los gastos del hogar. En su negocio los productos que ofrece son mu\u00f1equer\u00eda, art\u00edculos de lencer\u00eda, sabanas, cortinas, que vende de contado desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 5 de la tarde, compra de contado y prefiere hacerlo en mayor volumen, para obtener descuentos especiales y trasladarlos a los precios de sus productos.

She lives together with her husband and her two daughters who are 3 and 8 years old.  The idea for Isaura's business came about when a neighbor asked for her help in making dolls, sheets and curtains.  That is when she first learned the craft and started being paid for her work.  She later set up her own business without any technical training but simply making the most of her ability to look and re-create what she saw.  \r\n\r\nIsaura's business goals are to acquire her own premises, create jobs for other people and train continuously until she manages to perfect her skills.  Her goals for her family are to offer her children a higher education and to provide her husband with even more help in covering their household expenses.  In her business, Isaura makes dolls, linens, sheets and curtains.  She sells these goods for cash from 8.00am until 5.00pm.  She pays for her purchases in cash and prefers to buy in bulk so that she can obtain special discounts which she can then apply to the price of her finished products.  \r\n\r\nIsaura is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy a sewing machine which will improve her production time and the quality of the finishing on her products.  She will also invest in raw materials and supplies which she will use to bring to life her Christmas designs as families like to decorate their homes with decorations representing the most beautiful time of the year:

She began this business in 2010 and it generates an income that benefits her household.  She had taken a course where she learned how to prepare these items and a year later decided to begin her own entrepreneurial venture.  Little by little she has been growing and consolidating her domestic market.  She sells for cash from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm and fills orders for neighbors, other companies who place orders with her, and small businesses from the sector.\r\nHer suppliers offer her discounts if she buys her supplies, such as wheat flower, in bulk.  She passes her saving onto her customers and keeps them happy so that they will return to buy more.  She is asking for a Kiva loan, through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy wheat flour, and dessert-making supplies.

Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Irma will purchase clothes in Tbilisi at wholesale prices and resell them in her district for a profit. It will be hard work for Irma but, according to estimations, her business will be profitable and will increase the family's income.

For the past 2 years, Josephine has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Josephine has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase her stock of essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil, sugar,and salt to attract more customers, and will help Josephine to generate greater profits and to pay for her medical bills. Josephine hopes that, in the future, she will be able to start a big supermarket in town. \r\n\r\nJosephine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past 3 years, Juliet has been working hard to manage her market stall, which sells raw food.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Juliet has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more raw food such as cassava and sweet potatoes, and will help Juliet to generate greater profits and pay her children's school fees. Juliet hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own.\r\n\r\nJuliet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past 2 years, Prisca has been working hard to manage her market stall, which sells raw food.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prisca has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more raw bananas called matooke to be sold, and will help Prisca to generate greater profits and pay her medical bills. Prisca hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own.\r\n\r\nPrisca is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is 23 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is single and has two children; one of them is currently in school. For the past two years, Christine has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Christine has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase stock of essential commodities, such as milk, cooking oil, sugar and salt, that will attract more customers, hence increasing profits. This will help Christine to generate greater profits and pay her medical bills. Christine hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand her business into a big supermarket. \r\n\r\nChristine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1258265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is 24 years old and lives in the suburbs of Tbilisi city with her mother and brother. Several times, Diana has requested loans from local financial institutions for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly income earned by Diana working as a saleslady. \r\n\r\nDiana requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nDiana will purchase clothes in Turkey at wholesale prices and resell them in the local market for a profit.

Violet is 23 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is single and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past two years, Violet has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Violet has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil, sugar, and salt that will attract more customers. This will help Violet generate greater profits and pay her medical bills. Violet hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business into a big supermarket. \r\n\r\nViolet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

He first started working as the head waiter and began saving to be independent, and develop his free, entrepreneurial spirit. Even at that time he didn't know to what he would devote himself, but with the trade relations he observed, he was directed to the costume jewelry merchants. So he bought a commercial point to start while he continued working so he could start his business while continuing at the restaurant. Therefore, he would be supported while creating his business and creating his own jobs, such as sales assistant.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy with his activities, because thanks to them, he has managed to travel to other countries, such as Panama and Peru. Nelson is considered very enterprising and successful with the potential to grow. \r\n\r\nIn his business, the doors are open Monday to Sunday from 8:00 in the morning until 6:30 in the afternoon. He wants to grow his business, so he approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to apply for a loan financed by Kiva. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he will buy a large volume of jewelry such as necklaces, clips, earrings, and bracelets. With them he will renew his inventory and get more since he is purchasing with cash and in a large quantity. The prices will transfer to his customers, so they will feel happy and return to buy more from him.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":766.51,"image":{"id":1258702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a large volume of jewelry, such as necklaces, clips, earrings and bracelets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":105092},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112211},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114829},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117509},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120251},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":123056},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125928},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":128866},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131873},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":134950},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":138099},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":147336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.55,"local_amount":105092,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":107037.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519818,"comment":null},{"amount":63.59,"local_amount":112211,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":114288.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071654,"comment":null},{"amount":131.66,"local_amount":232338,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":236639.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527679,"comment":null},{"amount":68.14,"local_amount":120251,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":122477.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928432,"comment":null},{"amount":69.73,"local_amount":123056,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":125334.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705584,"comment":null},{"amount":71.36,"local_amount":125928,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":128259.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967874,"comment":null},{"amount":147.75,"local_amount":260739,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":265566.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082603,"comment":null},{"amount":154.73,"local_amount":273049,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":278104.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731709,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T14:15:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509051,"name":"Fernanda Leonor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"FERNANDA LEONOR tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad de estado civil uni\u00f2n libre tiene dos hijos, vive con el esposo y con los hijos en la ciudad de Ventanas Provincia de los r\u00ecos.\n\nEs integrante de la VRC LA VICTORIA, se encuentra ubicada en el Recinto Pantano, pertenece al Cant\u00f3n Ventanas se dedican a labores Agr\u00edcolas y Pecuarias.\n\nFERNANDA LEONOR  se dedica a la siembra de ma\u00edz, arroz.

For the past two years, Grace has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Grace has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil, sugar, and salt to attract more customers.  This will help Grace generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Grace hopes that in the future she will be able to buy cows and build a house. \r\n\r\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past 3 years, Agnes has been working hard to manage her small clothing sales shop. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Agnes has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase her inventory of different fashionable clothes for resale, and will help Agnes to generate greater profits and to pay for her family's medical expenses and school fees. Agnes hopes that, in the future, she will be able to build a permanent house for her children. \r\n\r\nAgnes is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is separated, and has three children who are now independent, and she works as a seamstress.  She lives in her own house that, with a huge effort, she managed to build.  As a seamstress, Bertha makes clothes for men, women and children for all occasions: graduations, important birthday celebrations, school events and other occasions.  She works in her own house, in a well-equipped room that has sewing machines and furniture.  It is here that she tends to her customers in a very friendly manner.  She works for a private company part time and as a seamstress in the afternoons.  She started this work when she saw her mother sew and realised that it could be profitable.  When she started, she had only one machine that she bought with an MFP loan and now her business is well under way.  She works alone.  She says that she thinks the work is profitable because it is generating a good income.  She provided her children with a good education and looked after them well.  She is able to pay her household bills but before starting this business, she did not have enough to do this.  She hopes to continue prospering, buy new machines and expand the business.  This, then, will be her seventh loan from MF and she is very happy to be able to count on the financial support that she receives, because this is what helped her business progress and what made her a businesswoman.  She has said that she is glad to be part of such a responsible group.  With the request for a loan of 1200 Nuevo Soles, Bertha will buy sewing materials such as material and elastic, among other things, to put into her business and to fulfill orders that she has taken.  She will buy all her materials in Lima where prices are cheaper when buying in bulk.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1258831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy material and elastic, among other things, for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T17:00:05Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":185.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":181.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":197.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":204.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":212.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":218.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.39,"local_amount":185.4,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":188.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189094,"comment":null},{"amount":71.66,"local_amount":181.05,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":183.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573040,"comment":null},{"amount":78.16,"local_amount":197.45,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":200.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122682,"comment":null},{"amount":81.07,"local_amount":204.81,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:43Z","rounded_local_amount":207.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868508,"comment":null},{"amount":84.1,"local_amount":212.45,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":215.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577339,"comment":null},{"amount":86.62,"local_amount":218.84,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":222.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529580,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T20:55:24Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509122,"name":"Ingrid Sagrario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ingrid compr\u00f3 cajas de cervezas con las que surti\u00f3 su punto frio y vendi\u00f3, aumentando su utilidad con ese nuevo capital de trabajo.

loan.  Her first loan for 35,000 KGS was paid in full and on time.  Kiyal is 36 years old and has two children at home.  In 2004, while searching for a source of income for her family, Kiyal started her business selling vegetables with the starting sum of 2,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her perseverance and hard work, she was able to increase her monthly income to 15,000 som (KGS).  She doesn't have a large stock of products at this time, which is why she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  Kiyal plans on spending part of the proceeds from her loan on building materials to repair her home, and part to pay for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1257383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to increase her variety of goods on offer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kiyal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9121},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9181},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9403},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9630},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9863},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10101},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10345},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10595},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10851},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10910}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":193.82,"local_amount":9121,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":9183.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071301,"comment":null},{"amount":195.1,"local_amount":9181,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":9244.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459731,"comment":null},{"amount":199.81,"local_amount":9403,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":9467.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012496,"comment":null},{"amount":204.64,"local_amount":9630,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":9696.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754850,"comment":null},{"amount":209.59,"local_amount":9863,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9930.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458867,"comment":null},{"amount":214.64,"local_amount":10101,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10170.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863002,"comment":null},{"amount":219.84,"local_amount":10345,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":10416.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631533,"comment":null},{"amount":225.14,"local_amount":10595,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10667.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495418,"comment":null},{"amount":230.58,"local_amount":10851,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10925.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743655,"comment":null},{"amount":231.84,"local_amount":10910,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10985.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013876,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T23:59:27Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T09:55:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":508849,"name":"Mwanakombo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanakombo is a widow who is 32 years old.

","en":"Gulnara is 27 years old, married and has a wonderful son. Gulnara works with livestock breeding, which is their main source of income. After having started this business 7 years ago with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS), Gulnara was able to develop her business thanks to persistent work. The monthly income is in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Today the farm counts 4 cows, 4 horses and 10 sheep. Thanks to the income from the business, Gulnara can pay for the basic needs of the family. Gulnara sells milk and dairy products from her home. \n\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulnara turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of livestock. This will increase the amount of milk, and accordingly, the family's income. Gulnara plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business and in the future would like to realize her dream of purchasing a car.

is 56 years old and is married with eight children.  Her husband helps her around the house.  In search of a source of income for her family, Zairakan started her business raising animals in 1975 with a starting sum of 16,000 som (KGS).  Having successfully worked in areas like livestock and agriculture, Zairakan also grows fodder, which she uses to feed her animals.  She sells the extra fodder to supplement her family's income.  In addition to the fodder, Zairakan also grows wheat on her plot of land.  Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS.  To further increase her business, Zairakan has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners to ask for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy cows.  With the income from this loan, she plans on improving her family's standard of living.  Zairakan has told us that in the future she plans on paying for her younger son's education and improving the living conditions of her animals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225.08,"image":{"id":1257416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She lives with Augusto who is employed and the father of their two children who are 3 and 2 years old.  They are comfortably installed in their own house.  Maudy\u2019s activity is selling food like \u2018juanes,\u2019[rice with meat and other ingredients wrapped in banana leaves] grilled fish, noodles and others in the evening.  To do so, she sets up a table in front of her house where she kindly takes care of all her customers who for the most part are neighbors and passersby in the area.  She had left the business for personal reasons and now plans to restart it and is gathering together the various items like dishes, pots and others, she needs.  She intends to carry it out alone.  She considers the business to be quite profitable because of the demand for it since she\u2019s very well-known and sought-after in the zone; her neighbors have been asking her to go back into business.  \r\nOn the other hand, she comments that she has economic problems because her spouse\u2019s income is insufficient to cover all her expenses which is why she wants to help out by earning additional income.\r\n\r\nSeeing that her business is profitable and that she has pending orders, she wants to start and continue with it until it grows enough for her to open a restaurant because she likes to cook.  Therefore, this will be her second MFP loan.  She\u2019s happy to know that she will be able to count on financial support to reach her goals.  She commits to being responsible with her installment payments like she was previously.  She also comments that she\u2019s comfortable in her communal bank because of the support the people have given her in accessing loans.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 800 new soles to buy utensils for her business like pots, glasses, dishes and others as well as tables and chairs.  She will also buy ingredients needed to prepare the dishes looking for the lowest prices by buying in volume and paying cash.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1258851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy pots, glasses, dishes and also tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T18:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T18:20:05Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maudy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":123.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":120.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":136.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":141.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.2,"local_amount":123.58,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":128.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189099,"comment":null},{"amount":49.03,"local_amount":120.68,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":125.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573045,"comment":null},{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":131.62,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":137.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122687,"comment":null},{"amount":55.47,"local_amount":136.53,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":142.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868513,"comment":null},{"amount":57.53,"local_amount":141.61,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":147.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577344,"comment":null},{"amount":59.3,"local_amount":145.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":152.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529585,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T00:28:28Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":509135,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelly, de 64 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer trabajadora y decidida a salir adelante, su conviviente la abandono a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s.
