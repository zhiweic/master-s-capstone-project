She started her small grocery store business with her own capital 4 years ago, with the help of her husband at the time. Her husband later left her alone with the business, but she decided to keep the grocery store business going. Noting that the grocery store needed more capital, she decided to ask for small loans from financial institutions to increase her sales. In addition to her small grocery store, she has another job: she works as a teacher at a school, which generates extra income. \r\n\r\nShe asks for the financing to buy all of the general merchandise, such as rice, beans, sugar, oil, chicken, soda and dairy products. She estimates that this loan will help her to grow her inventory by buying products that she doesn't yet stock. As the Christmas season is approaching, when the demand for her products increase, her future plans are to expand her business by buying clothing and shoes.

So she planned to help her sister financially and started a small tailoring shop with her one sewing machine. She took orders from her customers for stitching plastic bags and whenever she had time, she got involved in a cane craft. She makes mirror stands, tools, chairs etc. from cane. She says that the cane craft is more profitable than tailoring. Because of her limited financial condition, she is not able to develop her cane craft business. She earns 3,000 INR per month from this activity, which is not sufficient for her family. She plans to purchase the raw materials (cane, coloring, nails, etc.) and appoint two workers for her business.\n \nShe has requested a loan of 30,000 INR for purchasing raw materials (cane, coloring,

She is 48 years old and lives with her grown son and husband. The source of income for the family is a small monthly salary earned by Maia, working as a teacher locally. Besides, the family runs a small dairy farm of two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. The cheese is sold locally. In addition, she sows potatoes on the family-owned land and sells the harvested products at the local open market. \r\n\r\nMaia\u2019s husband has a tractor and serves local farmers. Maia and her husband decided to start their business, as their existing income wasn't enough for the family and their living conditions are poor. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

is a 27-year-old young man. He is married and a father to a 1-year-old daughter.\r\n\r\nFor the past four years, Salah has been operating a mobile phones store, which is located in a distinguished place in the market and has many loyal customers and a good reputation among them. This makes his project a profitable one and the only source of income to the family, but in spite of being a successful project, it also needs more support to cover some costs.\r\n\r\nSalah is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a new collection of mobile phones and accessories. This will meet the customers\u2019 requests and increase the sales, which will improve Salah's income and enable him to create better living conditions for his family.\r\n\r\nSalah is photographed inside his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He began the business of tea tree farming this year. \r\n\r\nHe learned about Milango through an employee who invited him to the group, and he joined the group with an aim of accessing credit. The main challenge in the area has been the seasonal weather. He believes this will be sorted once he purchases a water pump. \r\n\r\nCharles is applying for a loan of 62,650 Kenya shillings to buy tea tree seedlings for the business. His extra income from the loan will be added to his savings. \r\n\r\nHe looks forward to establishing the farming by increasing the acreage.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1267906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy tea tree seedlings for the business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nanyuki","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":203,"posted_date":"2012-12-31T21:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-30T21:40:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62650,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":34,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":15663},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":15663},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":15663},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":15661}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.51},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.51},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-31T23:04:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":511189,"name":"Katambo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Katambo is taking out another Kiva loan of 50,000 KES.

Ella se dedica al comercio junto a su abuela desde hace cinco a\u00f1os; su mam\u00e1 se caso con otra persona y se fue de la casa; por eso Diana se quedo con su abuela y su esposo. Ella junto a su esposo instalaron una tienda de productos b\u00e1sicos, a la cual tratan de surtirla cada d\u00eda, ya que desean brindar una buena atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes. Para comprar los productos para su tienda, debe viajar a la ciudad, para eso camina  a pie unos treinta minutos, luego aborda el autob\u00fas que la conduce a la ciudad y tarda cuarenta minutos para llegar y luego regresarse a su casa. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar un quintal de fr\u00edjol, un quintal de az\u00facar, un quintal de arroz, dos garrafas de aceite, tres cajas de jab\u00f3n, rinso, lej\u00eda y la otra parte para instalar la luz el\u00e9ctrica en su casa. Actualmente, Diana traslada luz de la casa de su abuela hacia la casa de ella; pero lo ideal es que ella lo tenga solo para ella, adem\u00e1s que comprara m\u00e1s productos, pues cada d\u00eda los clientes demandan m\u00e1s productos y mejor atenci\u00f3n a sus necesidades. Su objetivo es ahorrar, para comprarse un terreno y construir su casa, donde vive es de un familiar. Por otra parte desea que su negocio prospere para que sus vecinos no viajen a la ciudad en busca de productos; sino que los puedan adquirir en su tienda. Todo esfuerzo que realiza , es con la \u00fanica finalidad de brindar a su hijo alimentaci\u00f3n, salud, vestuario y educaci\u00f3n. \n\n","en":"\n\n\nDiana, 24, is married and has a four-month-old son.  She and her grandmother have been merchants for five years.  Her mother remarried and left home which is why Diana lives with her grandmother and her husband.  She and her husband set up a grocery store that they try to stock every day because they want to provide good customer service.  To buy products for their store, she must travel to the city and to do so she first walks for half an hour to catch a bus that takes her to the city; it takes 40 minutes to get there and then she has to make the return trip home.\n\nPart of the loan she\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy a quintal of beans, a quintal of sugar, a quintal of rice, two large jugs of oil, three boxes of soap, RInso [brand of detergent] and lye and the other part is to install electricity at home.  Diana currently transfers electricity from her grandmother\u2019s house to hers but the ideal thing is for her to have her own.  She will also buy more products because customers demand more things every day to better meet their needs.  Her goal is to save up to buy a lot to build a house because where she lives now belongs to a relative.  On the other hand, she hopes her business will prosper so that her neighbors won\u2019t have to travel to the city seeking products but will be able to buy them in her store.  All her efforts are aimed exclusively at providing her son with food, health, clothing and education.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1245286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:46Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":47.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":49.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":52.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":53.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":56.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.94,"local_amount":93.94,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:20:57Z","rounded_local_amount":93.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517281,"comment":null},{"amount":48.3,"local_amount":48.3,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":48.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069112,"comment":null},{"amount":50.83,"local_amount":50.83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356495375,"comment":null},{"amount":49.83,"local_amount":49.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":49.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525333,"comment":null},{"amount":87.94,"local_amount":87.94,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":87.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381938645,"comment":null},{"amount":53.05,"local_amount":53.05,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":53.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390801637,"comment":null},{"amount":54.07,"local_amount":54.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":54.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814738,"comment":null},{"amount":26.79,"local_amount":26.79,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":26.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090583,"comment":null},{"amount":81.94,"local_amount":81.94,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":81.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856583,"comment":null},{"amount":53.31,"local_amount":53.31,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":53.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429504879,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-09T00:56:02Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T15:47:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502130,"name":"Annelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annelyn is 20 years old and is a very industrious bachelorette.

Her husband Carlos is just as devoted to his job drilling wells for water, which he is very good at thanks to 20 years of experience. The reason for this loan is to buy fodder for her cows to continue making cheese from the milk her cows produce.

Now, she is leading a loan group of two female members to take out a loan in the amount of 1,400,000 KHR each. Khom will spend some portion of her loan to buy fertilizer to apply to her farmland. The other portion of the loan will be spent on building a proper latrine and buying a bike for her beloved children to help make their transportation to school easier. In the future, Khom dreams of being able to expand her rice-growing business.

With the help of this loan, Prom expects that his pigs will be healthier and fatter so that he can earn greater profits from this pig-raising business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1250638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pig feed and piglets to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:09:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:09:41Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Prom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1500000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197833,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T02:09:15Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:34:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504824,"name":"Sokny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokny lives in a rural village of Kampong Cham province\u2019s Ponhea Krek district in Cambodia.

He sells all types of products like rice, sugar, oil, detergent, etc. there.  He started with very little but as days passed and with help from the loans he\u2019s been gradually enlarging the business and he currently has a well-stocked store.  He works there with help from his wife who is the one that spends most of her time there since he has to work in agriculture.  His parcel is currently ready for the arrival of winter and he will be planting corn and peanuts.  He\u2019s been in business more than two years and it makes it possible for him to get ahead.\r\n\r\nHe will use this loan to better stock his store.  He will buy basic staples as well as seeds and insecticides for the crops.  He\u2019s been in the communal bank for two cycles and likes it for the help the institution provides.  His dream is to have his own house and a larger, better-stocked store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":852674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy basic staples, seeds and insecticide.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Ana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:10:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:10:41Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1080.86,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":274.99,"local_amount":270.21,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":274.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517943,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.14,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069758,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.14,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355815824,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.14,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525938,"comment":null},{"amount":275.02,"local_amount":270.23,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":275.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372926748,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T19:06:37Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:22:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":505181,"name":"Rosa Amparo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la parroquia Ayacucho del cant\u00f3n Santa Ana, lugar conocido por sus hermosos balnearios de agua dulce que son un gran atractivo tur\u00edstico del cant\u00f3n y la provincia misma, all\u00ed se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas el Banco Comunal Damas de Agua Fr\u00eda.\n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Rosa, tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene tres hijos de 20, 13 y 12 a\u00f1os los cuales estudian en  Universidad y colegio.

se\u00f1or Salvador, tiene 23 a\u00f1os, esta acompa\u00f1ado  y tiene un hijo. Hace 2 a\u00f1os tomo la decisi\u00f3n de empezar y establecer  su propio negocio de panader\u00eda (elaboraci\u00f3n de pan franc\u00e9s). \u00c9l antes de poner este negocio, fue ayudante de panificador por 8 a\u00f1os y fue as\u00ed como aprendi\u00f3 el negocio y decidi\u00f3 independizarse ya que vio la oportunidad de satisfacer una demanda insatisfecha en su colonia.   \nEl pr\u00e9stamo, ser\u00e1 utilizado para reparar la galera en donde tiene el horno artesanal y su taller, resulta que el piso es de tierra y la l\u00e1mina est\u00e1 da\u00f1ada lo que provoca infiltraci\u00f3n de agua en el invierno y tambi\u00e9n la generaci\u00f3n de part\u00edculas de polvo en verano y charco o lodazal en invierno; es as\u00ed como se hace necesario comprar laminas para techo y materiales como arena, cemento para fraguar el piso de tierra, tambi\u00e9n se comprar\u00e1n bandejas para incrementar la producci\u00f3n de pan.\n El se\u00f1or salvador se traslada tres veces por semana a la cabecera departamental a comprar la materia prima para el trabajo, estos d\u00edas madruga ya que tiene que caminar 1 kil\u00f3metro para llegar hasta la calle principal que es donde pasa el autob\u00fas tard\u00e1ndose 2 horas en el viaje (ida y regreso). Cuando se baja del bus en el desvi\u00f3, ya est\u00e1 su esposa esper\u00e1ndolo para trasladar el producto a su casa ya que no hay calle y lo hacen caminando por veredas y cargando el producto en sus espaldas.\n La elaboraci\u00f3n del pan la realiza por la tarde y tiene el apoyo de su esposa y un ayudante adicional. Para vender el pan lo hace de manera personal sin ning\u00fan medio de transporte, utilizando un canasto caminando a pie por toda la colonia  y logrando as\u00ed la venta del pan. Por ser un pan caliente y artesanal es preferido por sus vecinos y por esa raz\u00f3n tiene un mercado potencial. \nDon salvador nunca ha obtenido cr\u00e9ditos, toda la inversi\u00f3n la realizo cuando trabajo de forma dependiente, pero hoy necesita el cr\u00e9dito para poder fortalecer su unidad productiva y de esa forma ser mas competitivo y lograr crecer con la venta de pan en lugares vecinos sobretodo mejorando la salubridad del taller. \u00c9l ha utilizado muy bien el credito anterior ya que esta invirtiendo bastante en la elaboraci\u00f3n de pan y m\u00e1s aun en estas fechas navide\u00f1as, vende m\u00e1s. El anhelo  es que en un futuro pueda adquirir su propia casa ya que en este momento vive en casa de su suegro y siente  incomodidad por lo que sue\u00f1a con darle mejores condiciones a su esposa, su hijo actual y otros que Dios le regale.\n","en":"Salvador is 23 years old, married and has one son.  Two years ago he decided to start and establish his own bakery business (French bread).  Before starting this business, he was a baker\u2019s helper for eight years and then decided to go out on his own and satisfy a need in his neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan to prepare his shop and the gallery where he has the artesian oven.  It turns out that the floor is a dirt floor and the metal roof is damaged and allows water to leak in during the winter.  The dust created during the summer and puddles in the winter make it necessary to buy metal for the roof, sand, and cement to fix the dirt floor.  He will also buy molds so that he can increase his production of bread.\r\n\r\nSalvador travels to the Cabecera department to buy supplies three times a week.  On these days he gets up very early because he has to walk a full kilometer to get to the main street where he catches the bus for a two hour round trip.  When he gets off the bus, his wife is already waiting for him to take the products home.  There is no street, so they have to carry the things on their backs.\r\n\r\nHe bakes his bread in the evening and has his wife\u2019s support and help from an assistant.  He sells the bread personally with no transportation; he carries it in a basket and walks around the whole neighborhood.  People prefer it because it\u2019s hot and artesian, so he has a strong market.  \r\n\r\nSalvador had never had a loan before.  He invested the money he saved up when he was working for others, but he needed a loan to be able to strengthen his production unit, be more competitive, and be able to sell in neighboring areas.  Above all, he wants to improve his bakery.  He used the money from this loan to invest in bread baking and more so for the Christmas season, when his sales increase.  His desire is to have a house of his own in the future; he currently lives with his father in law and he is a little uncomfortable.  He also wants to provide better living conditions for his wife, his son, and any others that God gives him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":894451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to repair his rood and floor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:11:52Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:11:52Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":65.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":66.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":71.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":73.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":87.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.46},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.26,"local_amount":133.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":133.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517294,"comment":null},{"amount":70.81,"local_amount":70.81,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":70.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069123,"comment":null},{"amount":152.41,"local_amount":152.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525343,"comment":null},{"amount":75.6,"local_amount":75.6,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133583,"comment":null},{"amount":72.59,"local_amount":72.59,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":72.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390801646,"comment":null},{"amount":79.13,"local_amount":79.13,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":79.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814745,"comment":null},{"amount":167.03,"local_amount":167.03,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":167.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090589,"comment":null},{"amount":149.17,"local_amount":149.17,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":149.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856591,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T15:54:16Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T15:12:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":505773,"name":"Melissa Yeny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Melissa es La socia que pertenece al  banco comunal \u201cQORICHUSPAS\u201d de la ciudad del Cusco \u2013 Per\u00fa.
