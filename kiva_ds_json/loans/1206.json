She is the mother of one daughter and lives in a common-law marriage with her partner. Five years ago, she started her own business producing arepas [corn cakes]. This idea arose because of the difficult economic situation her family was experiencing some years ago. She learned this work in a practical way, and little by little she perfected her technique and her knowledge for running the business. She has her daughter's help with the business, and she starts working very early in the morning, when she begins the day's production. Later she goes out to sell the arepas to various stores and to neighbors in the area where she lives. In this way, she has been able to generate sufficient income to cover her household expenses and provide an education for her daughter. Alba is a strong, dedicated woman who is passionate about her work and her family. This is the motive for requesting her fourth loan cycle, with the aim of carrying out some improvements to the business (replacing the floor and painting the walls). This will permit her to improve the image of the business and generate greater confidence among her customers about the way she prepares her products. This will be reflected in increases in sales and in the income she receives. Alba dreams of strengthening her business even more, attracting new customers and increasing production. This will permit her, in the near future, to enjoy better living conditions and to stabilize her finances in order to give her daughter the opportunity to earn a university degree and have a future full of success.

She takes care of them because they are minors and are studying in primary school. \r\n\r\nHer family works sowing and cultivating coffee because she learned this at an early age from her parents. They were the ones to teach her how to work the soil, because they were unable to support her in her studies. She only completed the second grade. Due to scarce economic resources, she decided to learn to work and help her family to get ahead. Her coffee plants are located on the same property as where she lives, so the maintenance and assistance they need is easier to give for their protection and care. Her dream, as the mother of her family, is to be able to educate her children so that they can live in good conditions and to give them a better quality of life with a higher level of education. She also dreams of improving her plants by sowing a better and more attractive variety of coffee.\r\n\r\nSo today she is asking the co-op bank COMIXMUL for funding to buy 10 quintals of urea, 5

He sells their milk door to door and in the main market. By doing so he generates income to fulfill his family's needs. His net income is not enough to cope with the daily and monthly needs of his family. He has lots and lots of expenses to pay for. Like electricity bills, gas and water bills, children's school fees, food expenses, and also buffalo-keeping and their food expenses.

Because he spent several years working at an auto service, he obtained sufficient experience and now want to open his own business in this field.  The only barrier to realizing his plans is the lack of money.  Mahmadnazar used his savings to build a 12x6 meter space near his house with burnt brick to open the shop.

She lives with her two children, Wilfredo and Yamileth, in the house she bought 10 years ago. For the last 20 years she has worked selling meat. She says that her job consists of buying pigs, particularly those which are heavy and healthy, which she then slaughters to sell the meat at local fairs. This brings in a good income, and she uses her good standing with customers to also sell beauty products. Things are going well for her, and she says that she sells more meat at festivals. A little while ago, she found a place to open her own chicharroneria (restaurant selling pork dishes), which will allow her to earn more money as she will be sourcing and preparing the meat herself.

In particular, he has a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land where 100 nut trees are grown. He works hard and always has high quality products which are sold at a good price at local markets. \r\n\r\nAs the income is only seasonal, Vepkhvia decided to get a loan and start his own business, so he sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.

meet 37-year-old Soyjah from Buchanan.  Buchanan is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea.  It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\n \nShe did not go to school and she is married.  She describes herself as a hard-working woman. Her spouse works as a security man.  They have four children between 14 and 23 years old, only three of whom are in school and live at home. \n\nSoyjah has a table business where she sells dry bush meat.  She has been in business for five years and works from Monday to Saturday, spending 10 hours per day.  With this loan, she will buy more dry bush meat.  One of the greatest challenges that she faces is limited income.  She transports her goods by shared taxi.  She started her business with money from her husband.  She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. Her future plan is to build a house.  She thanks you in advance for your

They had an agenda of helping each other start up small businesses so that by the time they marry they would be financially stable. Over that time they have been groomed to be disciplined and plan their lives while avoiding the reckless lifestyle lived by most young men.\nSince Shamata is not connected to the electricity grid, the group saw an opportunity during one of VEPs promotional drives and decided to partner with VEP and establish themselves as a solar lamp supplier in that region. They plan to stock solar lamps that are accredited by Lighting Africa as quality, and  which are also supplied by VEP and hence have a sustainable business.\nVEP has loaned them start-up capital and is also helping them in promotion and marketing.\nIt\u2019s expected that the business will pick up in no time as the community is already appreciating the benefits of using solar energy instead of kerosene. Peter, the Chairman of the group (the first person standing on the left side) explains that so far the group members are the first beneficiaries of the lamps and they no longer buy kerosene.\nHis wife who has suffered using dim light for 2 years is now very happy and is also encouraging other women to buy the lamps. Peter and his family can now enjoy improved health with cleaner lighting and they also save the money that was previously used on buying kerosene. He has opened up an account and started saving the earnings from the sale of the solar lights which he says will be a financial security for his family.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1421681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy solar lamps for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyahururu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-09-05T17:50:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-05T17:50:22Z","loan_amount":6000,"lender_count":193,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul Waweru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph Wambugu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John Ndungu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David Mutahi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter Gicheru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James Kabiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josphat Gathii","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":525000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":6000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":43750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T09:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":43850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410681400,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":43849.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419987589,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":43850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429639964,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":43849.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867618,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T21:43:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":602580,"name":"Shehnaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shehnaz is the age of 40, living in Lahore with her husband and three children. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been running a barber shop for many years.

She wants to set up a good spa with a gym, or to work in a hospital where she can earn good money.\r\n\r\nBesides aesthetics, she also wants to study marketing because it\u2019s something she wants to do after completing the cosmetology and aesthetics program, since she has to work in order to pay for her studies.  Maria Jose also likes marketing very much because she knows that she is a businesswoman and after a while wants to start her spa from the management side.  Maria Jose currently works with her brother, selling shoes in a shop, but of course she needs to continue her studies so she can become a great professional.

She signed up and passed; thanks to this program she was able to broaden her knowledge in all areas having to do with a career such as public accounting. One year ago, she entered the institution to broaden her knowledge, and she has felt very satisfied there, since it provides a very good quality of learning and accommodates her as a person. Now that she has the opportunity to do something for her well-being, she is not about to abandon it, and in this way she can provide help to her mom. \r\n\r\nCindy enjoys sports and likes to exercise, read and help out in the house.

She is married to Julio and has 4 children, and she lives with them in her own house. At first, she worked in agriculture, on some plots of land she owns outside the city, until she was able to save up enough money. Then, with the aim of remaining close to her children, she set up a grocery store in the first floor of her home. Each morning, she gets up very early and serves her customers, whom she treats with great warmth, since they are the heart of her business, and she offers them a broad variety of products, such as grains, vegetables and packaged foods such as milk, canned goods, and other items. \r\n\r\nShe likes to keep her business well-stocked at all times, since that is the key to retaining her customers. She has 12 years of experience with her store, and this has also allowed her to make good friendships and become very well-known in the neighborhood. This is her second loan with Kiva, and she feels grateful for the financial support she is receiving in order to get ahead. She is also committed to making her payments on time. On this occasion, she would like to have 2,000 Peruvian new soles to buy rice, grains and canned foods.

She is very grateful to her husband for trying to make their life better. \r\n\r\nNelufar has a dream of living in a well-built home where she can raise her wonderful daughter in good conditions. The house they live in now needs major repairs since it was built a long time ago and has many problems. But Nelufar's wages won't cover the costs, so she has to put aside money for the renovations from her husband's earnings. Some time ago, Nelufar began fixing up her house. But she soon had to stop working due to lack of funds. She now would like to continue the repairs and finally finish them. For this reason she has decided to ask for a loan. Nelufar has turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase building materials for renovations to her house.

The loan will be used to buy a fridge and sugar. This will help Sarah to generate greater profits, by incresing her sales. Sarah hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \n\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

In addition to the restaurant business, she is also involved in agriculture (growing bananas) which greatly boosts her monthly income. She started the business so she could support her family financially. She hopes to use the Ugafode loan (ugx.1,200,000) to buy more food stuffs to use in her business.

All of the children live with Do\u00f1a Ludis. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Ludis is a farmer who grows coffee, as well as corn and beans, although those two crops are only for the family's consumption. Do\u00f1a Ludis' parents taught her to farm when she was very young, sharing with her a lifetime of experience. The family owns its the land it farms, having acquired it through years of hard work and dedication. After the harvest, Do\u00f1a Ludis sells her crops to wholesalers who travel through the region purchasing high-quality produce at reasonable prices. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Ludis' long-term goal  is to earn first a high school diploma and then a university degree. Higher education will make her children proud of her; they'll see that she's a role model for them and that they can also achieve professional careers for themselves.  \r\n\r\nThese aspirations are the motivations for Do\u00f1a Ludis and her partner to strive diligently each day. Their goals are also the reason she is applying for a loan that she'll use to purchase eight quintales of urea, and eight quintales each of 12-24-12 and 18-26-0 fertilizers to cultivate and sustain her coffee crop.

He is married to Digna, his business partner, and they have children. He and his wife manage their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his everyday expenses.  \n\nJoseph operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. \n\nHe also has a variety store for additional income. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\n\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan.

This is her story: Hello my name is Massiel. I am 24 years old. I currently live in Altos de Rafey with a family member, since I am not from this city. Sometimes I find myself forced to move constantly because I am not from Santiago and I do not have immediate family members here. I was born and raised in the town of Altamira, Puerto Plata. I grew up there with my parents and went to primary school in a small little school, which was a little far away from me and I had to walk, but I went very happily because I have always liked to study.\n\nMy father is a farmer. He loves to work the land. This is his passion and our means of support, while my mother takes care of the home and the family.\n\nI am pursuing my studies in medicine at the Santiago University of Technology (UTESA). \n\nWhen I was young, I liked to take care of the animals, and when it rained, I would go take care of them and cover them from the rain and there one day lying in my bed I asked myself how I could help others and I remembered those white lab coats I saw when I went to the rural hospital. Those people who were at the service of the people, helping, and in that bed I said to myself I am going to be a doctor.\n\nI like the career of medicine for the following reasons:\n\nBecause I love the study of life and the way I can help people to prevent, to maintain and restore their health, because I want to help people who suffer, who are in pain and who find themselves desperate for a helping hand, because helping people gives me immense satisfaction and I think that God sends each person to earth with a mission and gives a skill and a virtue to each one and I have found mine.\n\nDay by day I want to improve it because I feel that with my effort, my devotion, and my dedication I can do a lot and that God will use me as an instrument to reach those who are fighting to live and to combat a disease and that they have a future ahead of them.\n\nI need the help of this loan because I come from a family with few resources, so it is difficult for them to pay for my studies, and with this loan I would do better, because I would be able to take a greater number of subjects and there would not be any limitations. Without receiving this loan, I would continue fighting for my dream; I know that it would take me more time, but I refuse to give up. This loan would affect my life in a positive way, because it would bring me to the place I want to be, my goal, my dream, and I would do it in a faster, continuous, and secure way.\n\nMy academic goals are: to do well academically, to learn for my life and my profession and not for the moment. Once I finish at the University my vision is to be a specialist and a brilliant physician who does her work well and cares about her patients.\n\nRegarding my family and personal life:\n\nI want to help my family so that they can enjoy the best quality of life. I believe in family and love, so I would like to have my own family and be an example to follow in it, to let the town know that someone ordinary like me can with courage and passion achieve what nobody was able to imagine \u2013 that I would be a doctor.\n\nWhen I finish my studies:\n\nI want to specialize in general surgery, have my office to work in, pay my debts, improve my quality of life and help all the people who need me. I want to do medical clinics so that people with few resources can come in and have office visits and medicines.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1421065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is the mother of eight children. Seven of them are adults and live in their own homes. Only one, a 21 year old, lives at home with them. He decided to stop school in the second year of university and  help his father with the work in the fields. As a family they plant and grow coffee and other basic grains on a small scale, which serves to sustain the family and occasionally they sell part of their product. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has worked in this field for more than 40 years now. It is a tradition that goes back generations in her family. She sells the coffee beans \"en oro\" (separated from the outer skin or fruit and polished) through intermediaries so they avoid paying the shipping cost to the warehouse. It is stored and sold there. Her fields are about five minutes away by car and another part 15 minutes away. Her goal is for her children to receive a better inheritance, leaving a solid house and land they can work. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's dream is for her youngest son to finish university. She considers that the assistance she is requesting from COMIXMUL will help her achieve this project. What she needs right now is to help her coffee crops buying 8 quintals of urea, 8 quintals of Formula 12-24-12 and 8 quintals of Formula 18-26-0.

She is married with three children between the ages of 3 years and 13 years. Two of her children are currently attending school. For the past seven years, Fatmata has established a business selling assorted drinks within the Waterloo community. She was a housewife. She began this business because she wanted to contribute to taking care of the children. She works at the business from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm, seven days per week.
