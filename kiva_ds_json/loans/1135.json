Oblokul helps his wife feed the cattle, but his main job is tending to their crops.

Because of this, Oblokul wants to buy cattle to increase the size of their herd, however they don't have enough cash on hand to do this.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Oblokul has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan.

In this way, Jhon will have his principal means of work in better condition and he will keep working and striving to achieve his great dream to have his own house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":209.5,"image":{"id":1341412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"pay for the renovation, change of tires, and battery for his taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-01T11:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-01T11:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":68.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":72.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":87.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":91},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":99.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":102.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.02,"local_amount":135.04,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":141.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664472,"comment":null},{"amount":28.91,"local_amount":72.27,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":75.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779189,"comment":null},{"amount":29.64,"local_amount":74.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":77.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054370,"comment":null},{"amount":96.93,"local_amount":242.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":254.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-08T17:36:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":561868,"name":"Araba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Although she has received no prior formal education, Araba is an entrepreneur.

This parish is often visited as it has a city overlook where you can observe the splendor of almost the whole city. It also has a beautiful church and places to enjoy the gastronomy and culture of the city. The people, like our members, are friendly, kind, and good humored and have a common goal which is to help their families to get ahead and to offer them a better future. They work in different fields such as agriculture, livestock raising, and business, and they maintain the culture and traditions of their people. \r\nOne of the members of this group is Perla. This is her third loan with the Arco Iris community bank and she likes the bank for the fellowship, unity, and good humor of the group members and for the loans that help her to improve and grow her business. She is 31 years old, married, and has two children who are 12 and 8 years old.

She has more than 18 years of experience doing this and the profits have enabled her to succeed because her husband sometimes does not have work or doesn't earn much in the fields. \r\nShe will use this loan to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics, and clothes. She has been with the community bank since the beginning and she likes it because of the help that they give with the loans. \r\nHer dream is to get ahead. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1339729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics, and clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-06-01T12:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-01T12:20:01Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1053.87,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":131.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":131.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":131.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":131.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":131.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":131.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":131.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":131.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":537.48,"local_amount":526.92,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":537.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381704161,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":263.46,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":268.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566585,"comment":null},{"amount":268.77,"local_amount":263.49,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":268.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815603,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-01T15:15:14Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:32:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":562514,"name":"Mendbayar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Borrower Mendbayar is a married lady who lives with her family in her sister's yard.

Her husband works abroad in the Russian Federation and she alone has to raise her children.  Her husband at least sends money, but it's not enough for their needs.  Shoirakhon's eldest daughter is already old enough and it's time to give her away in marriage.  Shoirakhon has to earn this money herself.\r\n\r\nShe started by working at the local market as a sales person selling children's clothes.  Little by little, she saved up enough money and opened her own store not far from her home.  Shoirakhon buys her goods in another city and sells them for a profit in her town.  And so for five years now, she has been independently working in this line of business.  Now, since the demand for her goods has increased, Shoirakhon wants to expand her business.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan.  She wants to use the loan to buy a new assortment of children's clothes.

Nevertheless, she is unable to meet their needs because of her limited inventory. She aims to use her loan to buy more plastic bowls to sell. With the new profits from her expanded business, Janet wants to buck the trend and ensure that all her children will be given the opportunity to further distance their family from poverty."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":273.13,"image":{"id":1357820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to

is 32 years old, married, and the father of four children between the ages of 2 years old and 15 years old. He is a maize farmer, farming maize on his own piece of land, which he has been doing for the past ten years. \r\n\r\nHe learned about KADET LTD from women who are already registered members of KADET LTD.
