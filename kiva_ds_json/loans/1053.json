education in the field of geology. He is 51 years old, married, and has raised 4 children, 3 of whom are now grown up and established in their own lives. For a long time, he has worked as the supervisor of public works of his hometown. He is well-regarded by his fellow citizens. As a means of supplementing his income, he began raising cattle. He started this business with just 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som and has worked hard to develop it to the point where it currently brings in a monthly income of 7,000 Som from the sale of cattle. For the further development of his business, Asanbek has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 Som (KGS) to buy two colts. In the future, he plans to expand the number of cattle he has for the purpose of increasing his profit from the sale of cattle. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":630,"image":{"id":1288714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase two horses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kok - Dobo village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-02-08T06:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-10T06:50:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asanbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":630,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":30136.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426789,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T22:21:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525284,"name":"Batbold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Batbold, 48 years old, lives with his daughter and mother in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

previous loan, Hurshed has decided to apply for a second loan, as the prior one allowed him to substantially expand his business of raising cattle. His wife and mother-in-law take care of the cows, and every morning they milk them and produce dairy products such as sour cream, ryazhenka (a type of yogurt drink), and cottage cheese, which they then sell at the market. This year Hurshed wants to build another cowshed for his cows because with each passing year, his herd gets larger and his current cowshed is not large enough to accommodate any future expansion. This business is bringing in a very good income for him. Hurshed wants to use this loan to buy building materials so he can build a new cowshed. He is very happy that he can receive the support of Kiva to realise his plans.

","en":"Samiboy is an active and hardworking young man. He has many years of experience producing traditional Tajik flat breads. He used to work in a bakery for another baker, but to his big regret the owner of the bakery moved to another town and the bakery closed down so he was left without work.

For more than 30 years, she has produced and sold clothing directly, producing household textiles and doing clothing alterations from her home and, thereby, providing for her family.

age 19, is a young farmer who lives in the beautiful village of Laguna, a few miles off the Southern highway.  The village is named Laguna because it houses a lagoon with various species of birds. He is currently living with his parents along with his older brother and younger sister. His dad recently passed his cacao farm onto Heraldo to instead focus on his annatto and ginger farm. \n\nBesides his cacao farm, Heraldo also grows other crops like bananas, plantains, coconuts, corn and other ground foods for home use. \u201cI like to drink a glass of cacao before going to the farm so that I can have energy to work,\u201d says Heraldo. He likes cacao farming because there is a good market for it. To protect his cacao and practice the sport, Heraldo goes out hunting cacao-eating animals. His favorite part of cacao farming is pruning, because he knows it\u2019s an investment to make his trees more productive in the upcoming season.\n\nHeraldo, who farms six acres, has a passion for cacao and spends most of his time on his farm on small tasks like removing suckers and infected pods. When referring to suckers, farmers mean excess branches on their cacao, which \u201csuck\u201d the plant\u2019s energy away from the fruit pods to the branches. At harvesting time the entire family pitches in to get the job done faster. Heraldo owns a horse and uses it to bring the wet beans home during peak season \u2013 March through May.  \n\nHeraldo is requesting a loan to hire people in the community to help him clean and prune his cacao farm and establish a nursery for his first expansion. Cleaning is the process of chopping the entire overgrown bush around the farm to improve air circulation through the plants. Pruning is the process of removing of nonproductive branches from the trees and is performed to improve yields.

Dmitriy is now approaching Kiva for a second loan of 20,000 Ukrainian Hryvnya so he can buy plastic covering, fertilizers, and seeds, and to begin heating his greenhouses in order to prepare them for the growing season.

","en":"Rustamjon is 38 years old, married, and has 4 children. He has worked in animal husbandry all his life because he did not study in his younger years and does not have an education. His wife is a homemaker who raises the children, but in her free time, she helps her husband feed the cattle. They live in a mountainous region where raising cattle is a good way of making a living and brings in a nice income. As this is their only source of earnings, they are trying to develop their business. In order to feed his family and improve his livelihood, Rustamjon plans to increase his herd and will use this loan to purchase cattle.

Raising cattle is their only source of income, which is why Hasanboy plans to develop his business and use the profit to build a house for his son. He will use the loan to buy cattle to increase his herd, thereby expanding his business and enabling him to sell the fattened cattle in the spring for a good profit.

She and her husband have been raising livestock for over 12 years. They now have 18 head of livestock which Sayora raises at home. She has a very good understanding of the nature of this business, and she knows when to buy and sell animals. She also has a dairy cow. Every day, she milks up to 10 litres of milk and sells it to her neighbours and acquaintances.

She is a kind and determined woman. Since childhood, Dilafruz has always dreamed of being a successful business lady and always strives to implement this cherished dream. \r\n\r\nShe is married and has three children, aged 8, 16 and 17. Her husband is engaged in home repair services and receives a small salary. This salary is not enough to provide the family with all the required means. Dilafruz decided to help her husband for the benefit of the family. \r\n\r\nWith this goal, she took a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate. Now, she can thoroughly start her own business and become successful in this sphere.

alcanz\u00f3 a terminar la escuela primaria sin oportunidad de llegar a ser bachiller y mucho menos profesional, vi\u00e9ndose frustrados muchos de sus sue\u00f1os. Vive en el cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra. Sandra reside en la Parroquia Puerto Lim\u00f3n de este cant\u00f3n, un sector que fue habitado por una comunidad ts\u00e1chila hace muchos a\u00f1os y tiene varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos. Adem\u00e1s los habitantes de esta parroquia en su gran mayor\u00eda, se dedican a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda.\nSandra siendo muy peque\u00f1a ayudaba a sus padres a criar pollos y gallinas para la posterior venta, terminando la escuela se dedicaba a ayudar a su madre en los quehaceres del hogar y tambi\u00e9n a cuidar a los animales. Con este aprendizaje, Sandra hace 2 a\u00f1os empez\u00f3 el negocio por s\u00ed sola y tambi\u00e9n atiende un local de venta de balanceado en un peque\u00f1o espacio de su casa. Dedica a este negocio 8 horas cada d\u00eda. Sandra siempre ha tenido objetivos y metas altos, es por eso que ella ahora necesita ampliar su negocio de venta de balanceado y crianza de pollos, acudiendo de alguna forma a la herramienta de publicidad y as\u00ed incrementar sus ingresos y tener realizaci\u00f3n personal. Es por esto que solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar los insumos que sean necesarios. Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa le brind\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n oportuna y \u00e1gil que ella necesitaba y que no hab\u00eda obtenido anteriormente. Sandra agradece su participaci\u00f3n en la obtenci\u00f3n de sus sue\u00f1os en cualquier parte del mundo en donde usted se encuentre. ","en":"Sandra is a 36 year old woman. She is single and has no children. Due to poor economic resources at home she was only able to finish elementary school without the opportunity to graduate from high school and even less to get a professional degree leaving her frustrated because she has not accomplished many of her dreams. \r\n\r\nShe lives in the district of Santo Domingo in the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province. \r\nSanto Domingo connects the Ecuadorian mountain region with the coastal region. It is a city which has turned into the commerical axis with several growing sectors. As proof it has several entrepreneurial families that a few years ago started with small businesses. Studies show that a majoriity of the businesses started empirically and have grown due to tourists, business people and travelers moving from one region to the other. \r\n\r\nSandra lives in the Puerto Lim\u00f3n parish in this district. This sector was inhabited by a Ts\u00e1chila community many years ago and has several tourist attractions. Also, a majority of the inhabitants of this parish work in agriculture and livestock.  \r\n\r\nSince she was very little Sandra helped her parents to raise chickens and hens for sale. After school she would help her mother with chores around the house as well as taking care of the animals. \r\n\r\nWith this training Sandra started her own business two years ago. She also takes care of a small feed selling business out of her home. She spends eight hours a day on this business. \r\n\r\nSandra has always had high expectations and goals. This is why she now wants to expand her feed and chicken raising business. She wants to use some form of advertisement and in this way increase her income and gain personal fulfillment. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to buy the necessary supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFundaci\u00f3n Alternativa gave her the attention that she needed and has not been able to get before. \r\n\r\nSandra is thankful for everyone around the world who is helping her dreams come true.

Specifically, they own pigs and sell the pork and piglets seasonally.

According to Credo estimates, the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo to start up a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides for business start-ups and re-startups. It has credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Nino will purchase two milk cows which she will house in an old, empty farm building located in the yard.

is 56 years old, with 3 children, from Dalarik village of Armavir region and is involved in agriculture. He keeps two cows, gets milk and uses it in cheese production. Then he sells the cheese in a local market and gets income which helps him to cover his family's basic costs.

Alice joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2007, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. She joined One Acre Fund so that she could get good training on farming and grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nAlice reports that before One Acre Fund, she was able to grow about 1.5 bags of maize per half-acre, but with her One Acre Fund input loan during Long Rains 2012, she harvested 7 bags per half-acre. She plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school, and to invest in cows. For the 2013 Long Rains season, Alice\u2019s group members will take input loans of \u00bd an acre each.  In total, Victorious B group will receive input loans for use on 6.5 acres of land.   \r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1288630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bungoma South","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-02-08T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-10T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sellina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chrispinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilasio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleophas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":71500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":71500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":72270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602636,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T02:09:26Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:22:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525381,"name":"Telman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Telman lives in the Sagarejo District.

She thanks God that they live in their own house now that they have made an effort to improve the quality of their lives little by little. Dora is a fighter whose vision has always been to give everything for the well-being of her children. She is responsible, honest, sincere, a hard worker, very friendly, and filled with pride for being a good mother. Dora has a small shop where she sells basic products and necessities like milk, eggs, toilet paper, and others. The store is located in her house and thanks to her manner of working with the clients, she has a clientele that comes to her looking to buy products every day.

He graduated the State Engineering University of Armenia with a degree in cybernetics and later worked as an engineer in Kapan for many years. In 2002, he started a business producing construction materials. For 10 years, he's rented a building in Kapan where he makes various concrete paving stones used in sidewalks. His family helps him run the business.\r\n\r\nSamvel is 53 years old. He's married and he has two children.

Cruz del Socorro se caracteriza por ser una persona trabajadora, responsable, en sus pagos, y lo ha demostrado en sus cr\u00e9ditos anteriores en tiempo y forma. Ha sido una mujer muy luchadora la cual ha tenido que trabajar desde muy joven para ganarse el pan de cada d\u00eda. Por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos no pudo estudiar solamente la educaci\u00f3n primaria.\nGracias a su esp\u00edritu de emprendedor y sus ganas de salir adelante, es que tiene por actividad econ\u00f3mica la venta de cerdos y productos l\u00e1cteos, desde hace  25 a\u00f1os. Negocio que lo tiene ubicado en un lugar especifico de su localidad. La rutina de Cruz es trabajar unas 8 horas diaria, ofreciendo sus productos. Actividad que la desempe\u00f1a con mucho gusto. El objetivo del cr\u00e9dito es invertir en capital de trabajo y comprar un lote de cerdos el cual se lo est\u00e1n ofreciendo a un buen precio.

She grew up in the \"departamento\" of Leon in western Nicaragua.  She is a hard-working, responsible woman who has repaid past loans on time and in accordance with all terms and conditions.  She knows how to work hard because she's had to work hard all her life just to put food on the table.  She had to leave school early because her family didn't have enough money for her to continue.  \r\nCruz started her own pork- and milk-sales business 25 years ago, a business that she scraped together thanks to her great spirit and drive to get ahead.  She operates the business in the town.  She normally works 8 hours a day and says that she likes her work very much.  She will use this loan to buy pigs that she will resell at a better price.  She thinks the investment will help her to increase her income sooner rather than later.  Cruz is grateful to Kiva lenders and says that their loans make it possible for people with few resources in poor countries like Nicaragua to make a decent living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1290880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-02-08T22:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-10T22:10:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cruz Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.6,"local_amount":2133.37,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2177.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356527115,"comment":null},{"amount":85.43,"local_amount":2033.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2076.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364568318,"comment":null},{"amount":93.96,"local_amount":2237.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2283.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373162936,"comment":null},{"amount":86.1,"local_amount":2049.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2092.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381968709,"comment":null},{"amount":88.48,"local_amount":2106.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2150.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390830517,"comment":null},{"amount":90.41,"local_amount":2152.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2197.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399855323,"comment":null},{"amount":516.02,"local_amount":12286.19,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":12541.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410130634,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T00:03:41Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T15:49:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525506,"name":"Bong's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bong was born in 1981.

The members of the community association are involved in various businesses including: selling cosmetics, corner store, selling toys, selling juice, selling natural medicine, hat shop, selling gifts, making sweaters.\r\n\r\nThe loan will benefit small businesses, of which Primitiva is a member. She joined Pro Mujer two years ago at the invitation of a friend who is a member of the institution.

At present both of his children are studying. \r\n\r\nHe works in agriculture, sowing maize, beans and tomatoes. He has been doing this for 15 years. He started doing this kind of work when he was very young, helping his mother with the sowing. Now he has cows and the land that he works he purchased with the money he earned from his crops. He hires labourers to carry out work. \r\n\r\nHe always takes his harvest to sell in Managua, where they pay better prices for grain. On this occasion Arcadio is requesting the loan to buy two cows. He will sell them at a better price. He will use the earnings from the sale to improve his income, which he can then use to continue investing in his crop for harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1290873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy two cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-02-08T23:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-10T23:40:01Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arcadio \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":867.78,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":433.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":433.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":433.89,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860471,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":433.89,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901685,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-24T03:05:54Z","paid_date":"2013-11-19T10:10:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525636,"name":"Poeurn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Poeurn is 51 years old.

At this time, she is working hard to provide income for their family.\r\n\r\nMerly operates an internet caf\u00e9 business. Services like this become a need as customers\u2019 demand increases. Her main patrons are students who require her services for school requirements. She has customers who need to rent computers for business purposes like writing a resume and office documentation; as well as customers who would just love to surf the net and visit any social network. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy additional computer parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMerly hopes that her business will keep on growing and dreams that her grandchildren will have a good education and a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1291075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for additional computer parts and supplies needed in her business.

The group consists of six members, and it has a board of directors with Nora as president. The members make a living through a variety of businesses, like selling cocoa, sewing, knitting, selling skirts, selling plants and being a construction assistant. The loan will help these small-businesswomen. This is the first loan for Nora, who was invited to join by a fellow member of the institution. She currently has a business sewing sweatshirts, which she learned from watching her mother and then established her own work space. She plans to use the loan to increase her capital and purchase fabrics at the trade fairs in the city of La Paz, and to use them to sew her products to sell at her sales post. This will help her generate revenue to provide for her household, since she is a single mother with a son.

Here lives Lucia, a 45-year-old mother of eight children whom she loves very much and for whom she fights tirelessly alongside her husband to offer a decent life with a lot of love and affection. Lucia learned to work from a very young age because her parents had few resources, so she only has a sixth-grade education, but she would love to be able to finish school. Day to day, Lucia works in her small business baking and selling bread. She gets up very early to bake the bread to be ready to sell to her customers, mostly around school time. She believes she is making headway with her business because she is responsible and has a strong desire to keep moving forward. Lucia is very happy and grateful for Kiva lenders, because thanks to your support she will be able to improve her home by putting down flooring and painting walls, among other things. In this way she can improve her quality of life, have more security and be able to keep fighting to realize her biggest dream: expanding her bakery and being able to offer more products.

is 34 years old and lives in the town of Bugiri in the Iganga region of Uganda. She is married and has three children with two of them currently in school. For the past eight years, Harriet has been working hard to manage her stationary business, which prints and sells stationary. \n\nTo help expand her business, Harriet has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to add stationary items such as exercise books and reams of paper to the business and will help Harriet to generate greater profits and increase the family's income. Harriet hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand the business to other areas. \n\nHarriet is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Harriet who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\n\n\n\"\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1034.38,"image":{"id":1287342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office

Every day she goes to the market to buy ingredients which she uses to prepare different and delicious dishes. She has given over an area inside the house for the business. In the morning time she serves breakfasts, such as fruit juices and sandwiches, and in the evening time grilled food. Her two nieces help her with all her work. They work for her serving customers. She has been doing this kind of work for at least 10 years. Sometimes her children help her out. She started out serving breakfasts only, but over time she has constantly increased the variety of the dishes she serves.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work.

He lives in the hot and welcoming city of Ica, along with his spouse and their children, whom he loves very much and for whom he fights every day in order to bring them a dignified life, and above all to bring them the kinds of opportunities that he never had. Silvestre has worked since he was very young because of the limited economic resources of his parents. Because of this, he was only able to study until the fifth grade of secondary school, but he would have liked to have a career in mechanical engineering.\r\n\r\nDay to day, Silvestre works as a chauffeur of a taxi. He works about 10 hours per day, since this is his only work and with it he can pay the bills of his family if he works hard. He believes that he is successful because he is very friendly with his clients and above all because he works hard to give his best every day. \r\n\r\nSilvestre is very thankful for the Kiva loans, since, thanks to the support that they have brought, he has been able to maintain his vehicle, which makes driving safer, and his clients have more confidence in asking for his services. This way, he has been able to increase his income and continue fighting for his biggest dream: giving a good education to his son and buy another car for work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1291570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to maintain and repair his vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-09T18:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-11T18:30:09Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvestre Giovanni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.43},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.06},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.81,"local_amount":61.07,"processed_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":64.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776394,"comment":null},{"amount":28.06,"local_amount":69.07,"processed_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":72.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483211,"comment":null},{"amount":29.61,"local_amount":72.88,"processed_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":76.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889246,"comment":null},{"amount":30.47,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":78.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664154,"comment":null},{"amount":32.03,"local_amount":78.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":82.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775326,"comment":null},{"amount":180.02,"local_amount":443.13,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":464.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778898,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T08:24:34Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:40:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":525772,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen, a 30-year-old married mother of four, is from Ozamis City, Misamis Occidental.
