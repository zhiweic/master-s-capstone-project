Avelina is one of those women who are helping their families succeed, and wish to provide them a better quality of life, in spite of the fact that she has had little since the birth of he small son.  \r\n\r\nShe is working to start the new flower season, and that is why she is asking for the loan from the financial institution because she wants to buy soil, pots, fertilizers, and plastic sheeting for the nursery; the plastic sheeting she has is very worn due to inclement weather.\r\n\r\nShe says that when it isn't poinsettia season, she sells seasonal fruit, and her husband helps her rent avocado and peach orchards, and then to harvest the fruit and take it to sell at the wholesale food market in the country's capital. She says that she has been in the poinsettia business for more than 25 years. Avelina's goal is to develop another nursery that is a bit more spacious, in order to grow more poinsettias.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to be able to buy a truck so that she can go to sell at the wholesale food market in Zitacuaro. This would involve products such as nopales, avocados, and peaches, as she has orchards and wants to make the most of it, in order to also get customers here in the region.  \r\n\r\nThe other group members are Alejandro, Epifania, Mauricio, Catalina and Ivan.

Roberto has a vegetable farm, and sells his produce to his customers at a very good price.\r\n\r\nDue to the effects of this past winter, which lasted longer than expected, Roberto has watched his crops fail to grow sufficiently. In hopes of changing this situation, Roberto is looking to buy fertilizers and seeds for his farm. Since he does not have sufficient capital to purchase these products, Roberto is requesting a loan that will give him the opportunity to purchase fertilizers and seeds for his farm.\r\n\r\nRoberto hopes that his farm can continue yielding high quality products so that he can sell them at a good price. He dreams of having a large farm where he can generate many jobs, as well as provide financial stability for his children. Roberto longs to be able to improve the quality of life for his wife and two children, while also providing greater opportunities for financial progress.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1000728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers and seeds for his farming operation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Santuario","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-02T02:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-01T02:00:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto Arturo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155287},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159670},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164177},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168812},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173577},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178477}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":180.39,"local_amount":313726,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":321639.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075706,"comment":null},{"amount":93.23,"local_amount":162132,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":166221.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326780,"comment":null},{"amount":197.24,"local_amount":343019,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":351671.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432172,"comment":null},{"amount":104.14,"local_amount":181123,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":185691.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378209,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-03T20:42:41Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399060,"name":"Twungubumwe I Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Jeanine fait partie du groupe TwungubumweI,  elle habite \u00e0 Gitega, elle a 31 ans et est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 Emmanuel, un cultivateur.

This town is known for its exquisite shrimps, its clams and the charm of its residents, who always offer their traditional rolls, alfajores and oquendos. It is the world's number one producer of rice by hectare and in large quantities. Among such great production is the Tacuar\u00ed rice, which is the best and most tasty kind of rice. Apart from the best rice, it also has the most tasty beans, and its beaches are the vastest and clearest of the southern area of the country. Experts say that they are the most beautiful beaches in the south, with a lot of potential nationwide. During his free time, Walter enjoys listening to music, especially classical music, because it is very soothing. Besides, being a good Peruvian, he very much likes the typical food, and one of his favorite dishes is the delicious \"lomo saltado\" (stir-fried steak and potatoes).\r\nWith a lot of hard work and most of all with support from his wife, who's his right-hand person, he was able to start his business providing decorations, rental sound equipment and also catering for events. He's very hardworking, but it is mostly his wife who encourages him to keep going in spite of the obstacles he may face. She was also the one who gave him the idea to be in this line of work. He may work up to 12 hours a day, depending on what type of event they're working on. He believes that his business is doing well because he's very responsible and, above all, because he's honest and kind to his customers.\r\nWalter gives thanks to Kiva lenders for their help, because thanks to that he will purchase plates, cutlery, tablecloths and napkins for his business, so that he can improve his services and increase his profits. That way he can keep on working and striving to achieve his biggest dream: to provide his daughter with a good education and to expand his

She also reports that she grows and sells Christmas Eve flowers (poinsettias). She has been in this business for 20 years and she sells her fruits in San Mateo Atencio in the state of Mexico. She stocks up at the wholesale food market in Mexico and she also sells what she reaps from her avocado and peach gardens. She comments that she learned the sales business by herself - necessity taught her to make sales and not to sell off her fruit cheap. Gerarda is married to Gilberto, who grows poinsettias. They have seven children and their problem is their house, which is made of wood. They live in a hazardous area on a hill, and she's afraid that it could collapse and they could become homeless, and she's also afraid something could happen to them. She says that she wishes to use the loan to purchase soil for cultivating poinsettias. She also wants to purchase flowerpots and compost in order to get a very good production this year, since she sells the flowers in the state of Mexico. The other members of the group are named Carolina, Yesenia, Mauricio and Juan Luis. They will invest in seasonal fruits and vegetables, flowerpots and soil for growing poinsettias."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1011027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

has been an entrepreneur for over seven years.  She sells children's shoes.  Following her husband's death, she was left with four adolescent children, with her oldest daughter being ten years old.  Gulnora started to work as a dishwasher at various cafes and restaurants and earned a miserly salary, which was only enough for food.  She requested a loan from \"IMON International\", and her first loan was for 5000 Somoni.  Thanks to the loan, she gradually increased merchandise and expanded her business.  This success allowed her to marry off her daughter.  Gulnora is requesting a loan in the sum of 13,000 Somoni to expand her merchandise selection.  She is grateful in advance to \"IMON International\" and Kiva for the

This makes it difficult for her to increase her income, as it's hard to reach new clients.

Piedad's dream is that her salon will grow with the good service she offers, and that she'll be able to expand and hire employees in the future.

Desde entonces, Emilsen es la que debe buscar todos los ingresos necesarios para el sostenimiento de los gastos de su hogar. Emilsen se dedica desde hace 10 a\u00f1os a la elaboraci\u00f3n de bolsos, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 cuando en una empresa confeccionaba zapatos y aprendi\u00f3 a utilizar las m\u00e1quinas de coser. Emilsen decidi\u00f3 independizarse y mont\u00f3 su propio taller de confecci\u00f3n donde elabora bolsos y gracias a su buena calidad los vende a una buena cantidad de clientes. Emilsen actualmente tiene muy buenos pedidos por parte de sus clientes, hasta el punto en que a veces no puede atender todos los pedidos por la poca capacidad de producci\u00f3n que tiene. Con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n, Emilsen busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina plana para poder hacer su trabajo m\u00e1s industrializado y aumentar su productividad.\n\nEmilsen espera poder cumplir todos los pedidos de todos los clientes con la compra de esta m\u00e1quina, ya que realizar\u00e1 su trabajo m\u00e1s industrializado y demorar\u00e1 menos. Emilsen sue\u00f1a que con mayores ingresos sus hijos puedan gozar de una mejor calidad de vida y poder acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad que los prepare para en un futuro obtener un empleo bien remunerado.\n","en":"Emilsen has encountered many adversities in her life but through hard work has been able to overcome them and get on with life together with her children.  She is a single mother and head of household, with two children whose father passed away approximately three years ago.  Since then, Emilsen must seek ways to generate enough income to cover household expenses.  For ten years she has been making bags which she learned how to do while working for a shoe manufacturer where she also learned to use a sewing machine.  She decided to establish herself independently and set up her own sewing shop where she makes bags.  Because of the good quality of her products she has many customers.  \r\n\r\nEmilsen now has so many orders that sometimes she cannot fill them because of lack of production capacity.  In order to improve her situation, Emilsen is seeking a loan to buy an overlock sewing machine so she can industrialize her work and increase production.\r\n\r\nShe is hoping to fill all her orders with this machine, since she will be able to speed up production.  Emilsen hope to generate more income so her children can have a better lifestyle and access to a good education so they can find well paid jobs in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1003814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy an

Wilma poco a poco ha ido sum\u00e1ndole variedad de productos que ofrece en su papeler\u00eda, y actualmente ofrece cosm\u00e9ticos, prendas de vestir y bisuter\u00eda, lo que ha hecho que pase de ser una simple papeler\u00eda a ser una miscel\u00e1nea; gracias a esto ha podido captar una mayor cantidad de clientes. Con el \u00e1nimo de seguir aumentando la variedad de mercanc\u00eda que ofrece en su miscel\u00e1nea, Wilma aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de productos de bisuter\u00eda, cosm\u00e9ticos y prendas de vestir, y poder as\u00ed ofrecer mayor variedad de productos a sus clientes.\n\nWilma espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues podr\u00e1 atender m\u00e1s necesidades de sus clientes. Wilma espera poder ofrecerle una mejor calidad de vida a su hija y sue\u00f1a con que pueda ingresar a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria. \n","en":"Wilma is noted for being a very hard-working person.  She has faced some difficulties in life but she has been able to overcome them and make progress.  She is a single mother and has a 17-year-old daughter.  \r\n\r\nWilma has had to provide her daughter with a decent upbringing on her own as her daughter's father never made any financial contribution towards her upkeep.  When her daughter was born, Wilma had to leave her job in a company in order to look after her.  She needed to create work for herself so that she could care for her daughter as she worked.  She therefore decided to set up a stationery store in her home.  This business makes her the income she needs to support her household.  Wilma has gradually added a greater variety of products to her store and currently sells cosmetics, clothing and costume jewelry as well.  This has turned her humble stationery store into a 'miscel\u00e1nea' (a small store that carries a wide variety of goods).  As a result, she has gained a large number of customers.  With the aim of continuing to increase the variety of merchandise that she sells in her store, Wilma would like to take out a loan which will allow her to buy costume jewelry, cosmetics and clothing.  This will enable her to provide her customers with a larger variety of products.\r\n\r\nWilma hopes that this will increase her income significantly as she will be able to meet more of her customers' needs.  She hopes to be able to provide her daughter with a better quality of life and she dreams of her daughter going to university."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1517.18,"image":{"id":1005103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Debido una gran crisis que tuvo durante un tiempo, Roberto se vio obligado a cerrar su taller y a trabajar la fabricaci\u00f3n de calzado para terceros. Gracias a su dedicaci\u00f3n al trabajo pudo salir delante de esta adversidad y retomar su taller aunque con muy bajo capital. Como los productos de Roberto se han caracterizado por su buena calidad, ha podido captar gran cantidad de clientes y poder sacar adelante su taller poco a poco. Actualmente, Roberto tiene muy buenas ventas, pero debido a la poca capacidad de producci\u00f3n de su taller a veces no puede responder a todos los pedidos de sus clientes. Con el \u00e1nimo de poder aumentar su capacidad de producci\u00f3n y responder a estos pedidos, Roberto aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de insumos y materias primas para la fabricaci\u00f3n de zapatos como son moldes, caucho, cuero, entre otros.\n\nRoberto espera continuar mejorando su taller y llegar a los niveles de ventas que ten\u00eda antes de caer en la crisis. Roberto sue\u00f1a con poder ofrecer m\u00e1s empleo para las personas m\u00e1s necesitadas, pues actualmente emplea dos personas que nunca tuvieron oportunidades laborales. \n","en":"Roberto has been making footwear for approximately 25 years.  He previously worked for a company but one day decided to start working for himself owing to the low wages he earned from his job.  He started making footwear in his own workshop and even reached the stage where he sends them abroad.   Owing to a crisis that he experienced which lasted a while, Roberto was forced to close his workshop and work making footwear for third parties.  Thanks to his commitment to his work, however, he was able to overcome his difficulties and re-open his workshop, albeit with very little capital.  As Roberto's products are very good quality, he has been able to attract a large number of customers and gradually make progress in his business.  He currently experiences very good sales but, owing to the low production capacity of his workshop, he sometimes cannot fill all of the orders from his customers.  With the aim of increasing his production capacity and filling these orders, Roberto is hoping to take out a loan which will allow him to buy the supplies and raw materials he needs to make shoes such as molds, rubber, leather, etc.\r\n\r\nRoberto hopes to continue improving his workshop and to reach the level of sales he enjoyed before he experienced his crisis.  Roberto dreams of being able to offer more jobs to people who need them most.  He currently employs two people who never had work opportunities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1005121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

He always wants to offer his family a better quality of life. Javier is married and the father of one two year old son who is his motivation for working hard at his business every day. Javier works at a food stand. He learned to do this work because his sister had a food stand and she taught him about it. Javier put his locale where he can serve his customers more conveniently and this led to him increasing his sales considerably. Right now, Javier has good sales, to the point that he can't serve any more customers in his locale because it's at maximum capacity.  Javier wants to relocate to a locale that is nearby because it is bigger, and he needs to make some improvements on that locale so the kitchen will be more convenient and the locale more pleasing. That is why Javier is hoping for a loan to afford him the possibility os making improvements on the locale to make it more attractive and pleasing to his customers. \r\n\r\nJavier hopes that his income will increase considerably. He'll be able to us serve more customers that don't fit in his locale now.

He works in a photo shop as an editor and photographer.\r\n\r\nSince John Lester is the eldest son in the family, he is responsible for helping his parents to provide a better way of living for the family and to help his brother in his studies.  His family has owned and ran 1.5 hectares of rice fields for 23 years.  Since finishing his studies, John Lester only manages their rice field.  According to John Lester, the income generated from their farming business is utilized in their daily needs, tuition fees, and other school fees of his brother.  Due to high expenses of his family, the current capital in their farming business is no longer enough.  For this reason, he is asking for a loan amounting to P50,000 which will be used in buying farm inputs such as 18 cavans of fertilizers and insecticides for care of his rice crop.  Through this loan amount requested, John Lester could be able to make his rice field more productive and profitable.

Therefore, at a very early age, he started to work by cleaning some businesses. Subsequently, he set up his own business. He started a business making and selling wafers. Later on, with the profits from this, he set up a general store that he is stocking. Thanks to these things, Jorman has been able to contribute to his mother economically which has allowed them to have a better quality of life.

Henry con grandes esfuerzos consigui\u00f3 algunas m\u00e1quinas necesarias para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus artesan\u00edas y as\u00ed empez\u00f3 a generar sus propios ingresos gracias a que contact\u00f3 con muy buenos clientes. Henry posteriormente dio la sugerencia de capacitar a los presos de su municipio, de modo que pudieran trabajar para el desde la c\u00e1rcel, y de esta manera gener\u00f3 empleo para estas personas tan necesitadas. Henry actualmente tiene muy buenas ventas, hasta el punto que en ocasiones no tiene la capacidad de satisfacer todos los requerimientos de sus clientes. Henry, con el \u00e1nimo de aumentar su capacidad de producci\u00f3n, busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de maquinaria necesaria para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus artesan\u00edas.\n\nHenry espera que su negocio siga generando buenos ingresos, con los cuales les pueda ofrecer a sus padres una mejor calidad de vida y mayores oportunidades de salir adelante. Henry sue\u00f1a con tener un gran negocio donde pueda generar m\u00e1s empleo para m\u00e1s personas necesitadas, y poder llegar en alg\u00fan momento hasta exportar sus artesan\u00edas. \n ","en":"Henry is a great entrepreneur who is noted for being very hard-working and charming.  He learned how to make handicrafts approximately six years ago when some craftsmen visited his town and he asked them to teach him.  Some Indians then visited his town and they taught him some additional techniques.  In this way, he acquired the knowledge he needed to make good-quality handicrafts.  With a lot of hard work, he managed to acquire some machines that he needs for making his handicrafts and started making his own income because he contacted some good customers.  Henry suggested training prisoners in his town so that they could work for him from prison.  In this way, he provided jobs for these people whose need is so great.  Henry currently experiences very good sales, to such an extent that he sometimes doesn't have enough capacity to meet all of his customers' requirements.  With the aim of increasing his production capacity, Henry is looking to take out a loan which will enable him to buy the machinery he needs to make his handicrafts.\r\n\r\nHenry hopes that his business will continue making good income so that he can offer his parents a better quality of life and have more opportunities for making progress.  Henry dreams of having a business which can create more jobs for those in need and he would like, at some point, to be able to start exporting his handicrafts."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1005286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy machinery that he needs for making his handicrafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-02T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-01T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Henry Norberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":56970},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":58572},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60220},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":61915},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":63657},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":65448},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":67289},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":69182},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":71129},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":73130},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":75187},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":77301}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.14},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.05,"local_amount":56979,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":57210.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075758,"comment":null},{"amount":36.97,"local_amount":65729,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":65996.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902477,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":60445,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":60690.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326827,"comment":null},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":67764,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":68039.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432216,"comment":null},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":65428,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":65693.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378257,"comment":null},{"amount":28.37,"local_amount":50437,"processed_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50641.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432880,"comment":null},{"amount":58.39,"local_amount":103801,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":104222.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617364,"comment":null},{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":70818,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":71105.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640292,"comment":null},{"amount":18.55,"local_amount":32981,"processed_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":33114.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029364,"comment":null},{"amount":126.91,"local_amount":225618,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":226534.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165525,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-05T20:58:19Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389462,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelly is 44 years old, and she has been running her general store for three years.

Marlen is a single mother and head of household, with two children who are 12 and 7 years old. The father of her children abandoned her some time ago without contributing economically towards the family's expenses. Even though she already had a job which was supplying her with income for her household, she needed to find a source of extra income to support her children because the salary she was receiving in her other job was not enough to cover all of the expenses. It was for this reason that Marlen started her business selling personal hygiene products from catalogs, which she offers to her friends, neighbors and family. In this way Marlen is able to guarantee higher income for her family, which allows her to provide her children with everything that they need. Thanks to the good service Marlen offers, she has been able to secure good customers, who make good orders. With the desire to respond to an order that was made by a customer, Marlen is requesting a loan that will allow her to buy personal hygiene products like lotion, makeup and creams among other things,

Factor Emilio, debido a las pocas oportunidades de empleo que se le presentan, decidi\u00f3 montar desde hace aproximadamente 10 a\u00f1os una tienda general donde ofrece todo tipo de productos de la canasta familiar. Al principio montar la tienda fue un gran reto, pues Factor Emilio no contaba con el capital suficiente para esto, sin embargo, sus ganas de trabajar le permitieron poco a poco ir aumentando la variedad de productos que ofrece. Factor Emilio tiene el sue\u00f1o de poder llegar a tener un supermercado, por lo que cada vez que su tienda se lo permite le aumenta la variedad de productos que ofrece y le realiza mejoras locativas para cumplir este sue\u00f1o. En esta oportunidad Factor Emilio busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de productos de la canasta familiar para aumentar la variedad de productos que ofrece a sus clientes.\n\nFactor Emilio espera que con el pr\u00e9stamo su tienda pueda ofrecer mayor variedad y cada vez pueda estar m\u00e1s cerca de cumplir su sue\u00f1o de tener un supermercado.

Desde entonces, Flor tuvo que empezar a generar mayores ingresos para sostener los gastos de su hogar, pues los ingresos que generaba anteriormente no le alcanzar\u00edan para el sostenimiento de sus gastos junto con su hijo. Flor trabajaba como empleada en una empresa de confecci\u00f3n, all\u00ed adquiri\u00f3 la experiencia y gracias a esto tom\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n de independizarse y montar su propio negocio. Flor mont\u00f3 su negocio de confecci\u00f3n donde ofrece el servicio de confecci\u00f3n a terceros, y gracias a la buena calidad de sus productos, su taller tiene muy buen reconocimiento en su regi\u00f3n. Una de las m\u00e1quinas con las que trabaja Flor ya se encuentra un poco vieja, y ha hecho que Flor gaste mucho dinero en el mantenimiento que requiere. Es por esto que Flor busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina plana la cual le permita seguir trabajando sus productos con buena calidad.\n\nFlor espera que de esta manera sus ingresos mensuales aumenten, pues no tendr\u00e1 que generar tantos gastos por el mantenimiento de la m\u00e1quina vieja. Adem\u00e1s, Flor espera que con mayores ingresos le pueda ofrecer a su hijo una mejor calidad de vida y mayores oportunidades de progresar, adem\u00e1s de en un futuro acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad.\n","en":"Flor is a person who, in spite of the adversities she has faced, has had the strength to move forward and continue to progress in life.  Flor is a single mother and head of household.  She has a son who is four years old.  His father abandoned them without ever making a financial contribution.  Since then, Flor has had to start earning more income to cover household expenses since her earnings before weren't enough for both her and her son.  \r\n\r\nFlor used to work as an employee of a clothing company.  There she gained experience which allowed her to make the decision to work independently and to start her own business.  Flor set up a tailoring business, where she offers the service of manufacturing to third parties, a form of production that is set as a commitment by the owner of the production and \/ or a brand with the person performing the work.  Thanks to the high quality of her work, her shop is very well known in the area.  \r\n\r\nOne of the machines Flor works with is a little outdated, requiring that Flor spend a lot of money on its maintenance.  For this reason, Flor is seeking a loan that will permit her to acquire a new machine for manufacturing high quality products.\r\n\r\nFlor hopes that her monthly income will thereby increase and that she won't have to spend so much on the maintenance of the old machine.

Juan Fernando has been working for approximately the last five years in the forge where his father used to work. His father taught him the job and left the forge to Juan Fernando when he found himself unable to work. Ever since, Juan Fernando has been in charge of the forge and thanks to the good quality of his products and the good service he offers, the number of his clients has increased over time. Juan Fernando receives a very good number of orders through his forge and thanks to this, he has been able to generate an income for his home, but sometimes his clients place more orders than what he can fulfill because of his limited production capacity.

Due to his economic situation, he started working at a very early age and, therefore, only attended school until third grade. His trade is farming, which he learned from his father. This helped him be able to produce grain for his family's consumption. During the dry season, he worked with his father in the livestock ranches in the area. In this way, he learned the livestock hand's trade, which is what he currently does. \r\n\r\nEvery day he gets up at 2:30 a.m. to go to work and returns home at 4:30 p.m. He buys agricultural supplies in his town, carts them by bicycle to a certain point on the road, and then carries them on his back. He does all this after his workday as livestock hand.\r\n\r\nSergio is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to build a house, as the one they are living in is in poor condition. Because the house is old, its adobe walls are deteriorating, and in the winter, water leaks in. It is not very safe, and each day he lives in fear that it will fall down. This way he will have a safe home for his family's comfort and his own. He will also keep the few things that they own in good condition.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Sergio sees his children well educated. He works daily to be able to provide them with that opportunity, which he did not have. He also says that he no longer wishes to work at another person's livestock ranch. One of his goals is to work with his own livestock so that he can be closer to his family.

Hipolita's routine is to arise very early to head for her work location, which is the cultivated fields on which she grows cacao plants.

She lives in her own house together with her partner Jimi, who is 27, and their two beautiful children, Jim, who is 6 years old, and Kalef, who is 1, and to whom she wants to offer a better quality of life. Liliana is a determined woman and, along with her partner, works in the sale of spare parts for cars. They began this business six years ago, and they comment that it is going very well since, up to now, thanks to their good service and the best brands of parts that they sell, they have succeeded in obtaining a sufficient clientele. She sells the parts while her partner repairs some of the failures of the cars. The drivers don't doubt their work, because it brings them good results on the road. This work is profitable because every day they manage to sell a part, but it also has its difficulties, when they run out of the parts most needed by the drivers.

In search of a financing source for her family, Kanymzhan started her own business in animal husbandry 30 years ago with an initial sum of 25,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistent work, today her business has one dairy cow, five sheep and one bull, which allows her to earn about 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and meat products.  In order to further develop her business, Kanymzhan requested a loan in the sum of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep.

Santa, 30, and they are the parents of five children for whom he wants to provide a sense of well being. \r\n\r\nLeonidas is a very responsible man and is concerned about his family\u2019s happiness. He has spent 28 years tilling the soil to cultivate coffee plants and has 2 hectares (about 4.94 acres) under production. At harvest time, he always relies on the help of his children and day laborers to help him extract the seeds from his coffee plants. What he most enjoys about his work is being able to earn a good profit from the products sold at the collection centers, a place where they buy his harvest so that he will have money to support his family.\r\n\r\nLeonidas has come to MFP in order to be able to open a grocery store for his wife, while he continues to farm on his plot of land. His future plans are to increase his production with more coffee plants and thus provide a good education for his five children. This will  be his first loan with MFP and he is committed to being very punctual with his payments, since he is aware that if he is trustworthy, he will be able to apply for a future loan.. With the 3,000 nuevos soles, he will buy supplies such as rice, sugar, noodles and milk among other items. Thus, he will be able to open the grocery store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1008455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is taking out a loan from Kiva for the first time. Mavluda is planning to use the loan to purchase more livestock for her herd. She currently lives with her husband's parents but is planning to build their own house as her children are growing up and it's time to live as separate families. In order to finance the purchase of a house Mavluda needs to save money. Mavluda's husband also helps with the livestock business as best as he can - he raises and sells livestock with her. Mavluda also sells milk and dairy products on the market. Her clients are her neighbors, acquaintances and relatives. She is very grateful for Kiva's support and hopeful that she will be able to improve her living conditions with this

She has one daughter who is 5 years old. She is married and works selling traditional clothing and also sells fried chicken and french fries. She has done this for 8 years. She tells us that she is requesting this loan to sell traditional clothing because the school year started and she wants to buy blouses to sell them. Furthermore, she also wants to invest in her french fries business because she wants to change the stove since the one she has is a little old. So she wants to send it to be repaired so she can continue selling because she is the only one in her sector who has this type of business. So on the weekends the people already know her and they come and they buy from her.\r\n\r\nThere is also Lidia del Rosario, she is 29 years old. She has two children in elementary school. She sells new and used traditional clothing and she also makes aprons. She has done this for 7 years. She tells us that in her sector where she lives she makes different types of needlework and people come to ask for them. Also now she has started to make traditional bags, so women can carry their things. She tells us that thanks to God they have been sold, but she needs to buy material (scraps of tunics and shorts) to make them and in order to do that she is requesting this new loan. The two women are confident that FAPE can continue supporting them in what they are asking.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1008482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy traditional clothing to sell.\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Aldea Sacsuy, San Juan Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Olivia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.12,"local_amount":666.72,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":668.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016804,"comment":null},{"amount":86.84,"local_amount":672.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":673.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277206863,"comment":null},{"amount":86.05,"local_amount":666.16,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":667.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283315897,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":668.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850815,"comment":null},{"amount":43.01,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":333.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551653,"comment":null},{"amount":86.91,"local_amount":672.86,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":674.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377912,"comment":null},{"amount":86.06,"local_amount":666.25,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":667.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308388050,"comment":null},{"amount":87.09,"local_amount":674.26,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":675.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372540,"comment":null},{"amount":83.76,"local_amount":648.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":650.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981444,"comment":null},{"amount":43.05,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":334.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364515781,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T22:12:53Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:31:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399421,"name":"Komla","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Komla est un homme \u00e2g\u00e9 de 35 ans.
