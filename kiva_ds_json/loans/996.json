lives in the Muranga area of Kenya, which produces coffee for export.

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"Microfinance helps small scale farmers to grow their businesses.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked how this loan would benefit her family, Jane replied that she will be able to provide for the family's basic needs as well as paying for their school fees.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jane owns the following: poultry, pump, bicycle, but does not own cow, pig, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household mosquito net and running water but does not have electricity, solar power, sewing machine, TV or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1237567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

This group is dedicated mostly to people in the door-to-door business, vending their products on foot in different communities.\r\n\r\nEdicto is the hard-working father of six children. He lives with his wife and two of their children; the others are living in their own homes, and some reside in Haiti. He tells us that his biggest challenge is to finish building the family house, and he is still saving his business profits toward this goal. With this loan, he will invest in his business by purchasing products like pants, blouses, shirts, and underwear to offer for sale.\r\n\r\nEdicto is very excited to receive his twelfth loan through Esperanza Internacional, after having successfully repaid his previous loan. He has had this business for about seven years. He started the business using the first loan he received from us. His dream is to finish construction on his house and to live quietly in it with his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4750,"image":{"id":1237703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothes to offer for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2012-11-18T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-18T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":4750,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Edicto","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Nanci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Niurca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Lorenza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yoselyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Eliandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Fello","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Fifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Edrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Leonida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":189000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":14231.64},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14696.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":14942.14},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15192.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":15446.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":15705.8},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":15969.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16236.82},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":16509.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16786.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17067.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16215.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":369.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375.53},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":381.82},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":388.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":394.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":401.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":408.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":421.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.95},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":407.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1102.55,"local_amount":43869.94,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":43936.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981061,"comment":null},{"amount":770.04,"local_amount":30639.36,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":30685.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331964961,"comment":null},{"amount":796.06,"local_amount":31674.87,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":31722.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339509862,"comment":null},{"amount":824.31,"local_amount":32798.94,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":32848.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347061484,"comment":null},{"amount":1257.04,"local_amount":50016.89,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50092.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355806881,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-27T14:22:10Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T13:15:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":497166,"name":"Iman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iman is a 45-year-old married woman, mother of two children.

For the last four years, Leticia routinely begins her work daily at 7 a.m. with her employees: her husband and two assistants.

She said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money but, with this loan, I can gain money and expand my business. Because of ACCION, I was able to help people.

A musician by birth, he is part of the famous group \"Tamb\u00f3\" from the community in the Atlantico department, where he plays the flute and the clarinet. He has performed with many renowned vallenato [folk music from the Colombian Caribbean region] artists, and one of his most strongly remembered collaborations is the chorus he recorded with a musical group for the soccer team of Barranquilla, \"Junior tu Pap\u00e1.\" Sergio, proud of his humble origins, remembers the times when he accompanied his father, who was from the countryside, to sell his harvest of pigeon peas directly in the market. This is where his experience as a businessman began. It was accompanied by his highest passion, which is music, which he also taught in the university of the arts. He feels satisfied for transporting the folklore of the Colombian Caribbean from one generation to the next. \r\n\r\nSergio makes his home with his wife, a hard-working woman who also knows about business. She sells a well-known product called \"raspao\" or flavored crushed ice at a school located in a nearby village. They have two children, ages 13 and 18. The adolescent is already connected to the musical arts, which he practices, and his beautiful daughter of 18 is the town queen, and he is very proud of them. Sergio also has a business where he offers internet services and sells related items such as stationery and cell phone recharges. He began it a year ago to increase the well-being of his family. His business opens its doors from 8 in the morning until 9 at night, and his principal customers are located in the community where he lives and the surrounding areas, where he and his family (who support him in everything) are very well known. Sergio is applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing, to invest in a candy shop and to begin building his credit history, which is his final goal, since in the past he had not had any loans, and he recognizes that this is necessary to make his business grow and generate a greater infrastructure of family entrepreneurship, which in the future will allow him to increase the quality of life of his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1236147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to invest in

lives in Mariakani, Mombasa.

She started the business from a capital of about 2,000 Kenya shillings.\r\n\r\nEunice learnt of Milango from a friend and decided to join. She looks forward to being a renowned fresh fish dealer. Her main challenge currently is high cost of transportation; she buys fish from Kisumu, Kenya, about 1000 kms away from her business. This has forced her to deal majorly in dried fish. But she is now applying for a loan of 107,250 Kenya shillings to purchase stock of dried fish.\r\n\r\nThe income from the business will enable her to educate her

She is married and has three children aged 6, 8, and 11 years. All are school-going children. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sento established her mayonnaise, Ovaltine, milk, air freshener, luncheon meat, onions, rice, and sugar business. She began her business because she didn't attend school because her parents did not value girls' education. Her mother only introduced her to business. \r\n\r\nWhen she got married, her husband gave her some amount of money to start a business. Working 7 days a week and 15 hours a day, she earns about 1,800,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nSento would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. She requires a loan in order to buy flour (4 bags at 120,000 each), sugar (5 bags at 120,000 each), rice (3 bags at 130,000 each), soap (4 cartons at 250,000 each), and sachet milk (6 packets at 85,000 each).The balance of 20,000 SLL will be used for transportation. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sento plans to build a house and provide quality education for her children, as well as expand the business.

","en":"Ms. Juana, 53, is married and has a 17-year-old son. She devotes herself to selling prepared foods including \"patasca\" which is a traditional soup from the Andean highlands. The name comes from the quechuan word \"phatasqa\" which means split or burst, because the food is ready once the kernels of corn that are being boiled open up. It is a powerful soup of great nutritional value on account of the concentrate made from beef innards, ram's heads, potatoes, beans, corn and various spices. This food is begun the day before it is consumed because of its complicated preparation (often done as a group) and in some parts of the mountains it is often called \"sopa de mote,\" \"sopa de mondongo\" or \"mondongo.\" She has her sales post which is located in the town of Guardia. She began working with her mom when she was quite little. \r\n\r\nThis loan is her third with the institution. Ms. Juana will use this loan to purchase ingredients such as corn and potatoes for making patasaca. Her reason for seeking this loan is to continue improving in her work. Ms. Juana is a very hardworking person and is happy about the opportunity of having the loan because this business is her only means of supporting herself. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":1237646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase supplies such as corn and potatoes.

She lives with her partner and has 3 children of 26, 23, and 18 years of age. They live together in their own home. Neida works making clothes for women, men and children. She works with great patience to make the custom clothes that her clients order and also often makes clothes to her own design. She sells some of these in a small space in her home. She has been doing this work for more than 15 years and has always worked alone and says that she has never had a client ask for their money back as she has always been able to meet their needs. What she likes about her work is that she can translate her designs into clothes to be worn and this motivates her greatly to continue working. She hopes to build a much bigger workshop soon so that she can have a space to use solely for selling her creations.

They have only one child who no longer lives with them. Victor and his wife live in a house they own located in a rural community in the central jungle. Victor is a wise and cheerful man.

Victor sells each bag of 70 kilos for 120 Peruvian soles, so, each year he strives to care for the plants, so that the most common diseases such as coffee-leaf rot and rooster\u2019s eye fungus, don\u2019t ruin the leaves and coffee beans.\r\n\r\nAs well, achiote planting is profitable because demand for the product is throughout the year.\r\n\r\nA year ago he began with the development of coffee nurseries and he now has them ready to plant. He requires labour. He is requesting support to achieve this short term goal. This is his 4th credit with MFP.

Her family consists of her husband, one son who is nine and one daughter who is five years old. .Both the kids are studying in the local primary school.\r\n\r\nFor the last 10 years, Dalimba has been running a clothes vending business and a tailoring center with the help and support of her husband. She purchases saris and ready made garments from the local market as well as from the wholesale market 200 kilometers away. Her husband travels to different villages and weekly markets on a bike to sell saris and garments. Her stock includes saris ranging from 500 INR to 3000 INR. She earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from her existing business. But her present income is like hand to mouth for her family. So Dalimba wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business. Looking into the present scenario at the market, she is planning to purchase some quality saris and fancy garments to sell. Dalimba assumes that this will generate some extra income.\r\n\r\nDalimba has a strong desire to give a better education to her children.

Bolangir district is one of the underdeveloped areas of Odisha with 80% rural population. The young lady sitting in the first row with her hand raised is Bhodebi. She resides with her husband, two sons who are four and two years old, and her father and mother in-law. To increase the income of her family, in the year 2010, Bhodebi, along with four like-minded women of her village formed a group named Maha Laxmi and received a loan from Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n \r\nBhodebi and her husband run two businesses. Her husband manages a betel nut shop in the market area of her village and Bhodebi runs a general fancy store with fancy items like bangles, talc, plastic items, cosmetics, ornaments etc. in her house. Prior to this business, Bhodebi\u2019s husband was running a well-established general store in the market yard. But due to jealousness of some of the vested interest people in her village, her husband was forced to close the business. During that period, her family was leading a very pitiful life due to acute financial problems. This situation compelled her to find ways and means to maintain her family. So Bhodebi, in consultation with her husband, mortgaged her gold ornaments for 10,000 INR and started the fancy store with a low profile. Now her fancy store is running well. Bhodebi brings stock from different towns.  Presently, she is selling fancy items worth 300 INR to 500 INR per day from which she gets 15 to 20% profit. From this small income, she barely manages her family's expenses. So she wants to increase the volume of her business to increase the income. From this loan of 10,000 INR, Bhodebi wants to invest the entire amount to purchase different varieties of bangles\r\n\r\nBhodebi is confident enough to have a business of her own and hopes to give a better education to her two sons.\r\n\r\nThe other four energetic group members are Manjulata, Bhubaneswari, Bhaktilata and Puspanjali who are running a stationary store, and egg center, a footwear center and a puffed rice business, respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1238039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase bangles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Luthurbandh,Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-18T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-18T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manjulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhubaneswari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhaktilata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhodebi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":66000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":66000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T20:56:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":497434,"name":"Mourine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mourine is a 36-year-old married woman.

She is an active member of a JLG named Maa Ram Chandi located in Muniguda village of Rayagada district of Odisha, India. Muniguda is a small town bordered by a green forest, a mountain range and one river. Maa Ram Cchandi group consists of four energetic women who are running some businesses for the financial upliftment of their families.\r\n\r\nPuspanjali resides with her husband, one daughter aged 23 and one son aged 18 who are studying in college. She runs a small general store at Muniguda with the help of her husband. She sells rice, sugar, potatoes, oil, soap, toothpaste, etc. She also makes leaf plates with her daughter to add some supplementary income to her family. Puspanjali earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from the existing businesses, but as the maintenance cost has increased, the present income is not sufficient for her to manage the family. Previously, her group has already taken three loans from Mahashakti Foundation and repaid the entire loans on time. This time, she plans to use the loan for the purpose of including more spices items and stationary items like notebooks, pencils, pens, and compasses for students in her general shop. She hopes this will generate more income for her family. Puspanjali hopes to see her daughter as a nurse and her son as a police inspector and get them married into a well-reputed family.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Somarani, Papidei and Rangabati who run a Tiffin hotel, sell leaf plates at wholesale and run a barbershop. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1238044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase notebooks, compasses, pens, pencils, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-18T21:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-18T21:00:48Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Papi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rangabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Somarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":128000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":128000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T11:33:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":497449,"name":"Thon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thon would like to take a further loan to buy a washing machine to expand her laundry business.

her hometown of Houston, Texas, Deidra runs <i>Tropical Express<\/i>, a shaved ice shop.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to be an entrepreneur for about eight years,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t happened because I haven\u2019t been able to purchase the equipment.\u201d She first visited ACCION Texas Inc. five years ago. While trying to start her business, Deidra went to Small Business Administration, where she learned about ACCION Texas. From there, she was inspired to invest some of her money to open the store, which currently carries 14 flavors and will sell 100 flavors by April, when the warm weather returns. Though shaved ice is a seasonal item, Deidra operates year-round by also selling hot dogs and nachos.\r\n\r\nDeidra started her business in her grandmother\u2019s backyard. \u201cI did so well, but it got to be too much with the heat, so I stopped.\u201d After taking a business class and seeing the need for a shaved ice store within her area, Deidra decided to return to work.\r\n\r\nTropical Express is \u201creally the only shop in the area with shaved ice,\u201d Deidra says. The shop operates with a three-member team, working and volunteering to help keep the start-up costs down. Deidra needs extra help now, but plans to postpone the hiring process until the summer. She plans to hire high school and college students.\r\n\r\nThe ACCION loan supplied Deidra with hot dog cookers, syrup containers and a large cooler. Without the help of ACCION, Deidra says, \u201cI\u2019d probably still be sweating and trying to start up. I really appreciate ACCION helping me and being patient with me while working through the loan process.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6150,"image":{"id":1237848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to

Group\u201d. They live in Motbung village of Manipur state, which is located in the northeastern part of India.\r\n\r\nHebem is pictured with a raised hand. She is the mother of three daughters and two sons, and she is 40 years old. She lives as a single parent after her husband abandoned her for another woman. Now she lives with her children and one sister in-law. In spite of her marriage problem, she is determined and happy that all her children go to a private school in the nearby town, which is 5 km away.\r\n\r\nShe owns a paddy field to cultivate rice, which is a staple food for her people. She practices jhum cultivation [slash-and-burn] and grows vegetables such as pulses, pumpkins, yams and peas to sell at the market. She also cultivates ginger on a large scale for bigger profits. Every night before going to bed, she weaves clothes to sell to meet her daily needs. She is thankful to her sister-in-law for standing beside her and helping to raise the children.\r\n\r\nWith her previous loan, she has been investing in the ginger plantation, usually harvested in the month of January. Now she is hoping to get a good harvest when the month comes. The proceeds help towards enrolling her children in school for another term. She says, \u201cI may miss all the comforts of a caring husband but I am happy all my children are still going to school\u201d.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan in order to plan for 2013 income activities. As mentioned above, her ginger proceeds will meet the children's admission requirements only. She plans to use this loan to buy fresh yarn for her weaving and better quality of ginger saplings for the next cultivation. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members requested another loan to improve upon their respective income generating activities, which also include weaving and agriculture.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1238132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fresh yarn for her weaving and better quality of ginger saplings for the next cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-18T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-18T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chongjahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimchin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemchin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hebem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":105000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T05:51:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":497555,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miriam is a 44-year-old single woman from Israel\u2019s Negev region.

She lives with her husband Gay, with whom she has 4 children. But only one child, Cirila, lives with them. She looks after Cirila in the house that she bought 10 years ago. For the last 20 years she has worked in agriculture and cattle farming. Mainly she grows wheat, potatoes, barley, peas and corn. She also rears cattle, mostly bulls, to sell at the livestock fairs. At harvest time wholesale buyers come in trucks to where she lives to buy what she has harvested. This is how she earns her income. It is more practical for her this way because she does not have to spend money on transport, although she admits that the money she earns is lower. \r\n\r\nOver the years Carmen and her husband have come to realise that the work they do is a good option for them. Any difficulties they have encountered during this time have been overcome because they have been able to provide for their 4 children. She will continue to do the same work now, as it will enable her to sustain their family life. She has been working collectively in the communal bank \"Productores Huancas\" for several years. This is the 12th loan that she has requested from MFP. Her stamina is admirable; she is one of the longest serving members of the group. With this loan she will renew her efforts and her positive attitude. Carmen will invest the money in the purchase of alfalfa seeds so that she can feed her animals.

She lives with her husband, Anibal. The have 2 children: Lisbeth and Adriano. She takes care of them in the house she inherited 20 years ago. \r\n\r\nWith 17 years of experience planting wheat, barley, beans and potatoes, she has been able to strengthen her home's finances. Every day she does the rounds of her farmland. Once the harvest season arrives her task is to pack the crops into sacks to take them to the market every weekend, in the urban area. She sells them there and so makes the profits she has been waiting 6 months for. At harvest times she needs a lot of help and all the members of her family work. She also hires labourers to help with this work. She is very happy to carry out this work because it allows her to enjoy the countryside, and, although the work is very tiring, it is her way of life. \r\n\r\nOver the next few years, her wish is to plant more stretches of land in order to keep selling and making profits. She has worked for a few years in a group in the Communal Bank \"productores huancas\" and this is the 6th loan with MFP.

In 2008, these hard working tribal women came together as a group to help one another to empower themselves and improve their earning capacity. They belong to Kholep Village in Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. \r\n\r\nLhingneikim, who is raising her hand in the photo, is one of the group members. She is 42 years old and lives with her three daughters, one son and her husband. Her husband is 47 years old. He drives a van on a hire basis and all her children are getting a good education in a private school, which is about 4 km in distance from her village. Her husband's income alone cannot support the family, so they are dependent on her business. \r\n \r\nShe took a previous loan of INR 5,000 and with this loan she bought two piglets and yarn for weaving shawls and wrap-arounds. With much struggle and hard work, she was able to pay off her first loan. In this way, she contributed to the family income. With that loan and sale proceeds from two of her full-grown pigs, she bought a handloom (a simple machine to weave) to increase weaving in terms of production. Her daughters assisted her by selling door to door after school and on holidays. \r\n  \r\nNow she needs another loan to expand her weaving activities. She hopes to get a good price for the grown pigs with the festival coming ahead. With this money and the money from the loan, she plans to repair her weaving loom and to buy one more handloom to increase her production double fold. She is happy and wishes good fortune to all the lenders around the world so that they may continue their kindness to helpless people like her and extends her warm greetings on behalf of the group. \u201cHappy Thanksgiving for you and your family\u201d.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1238124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to repair her weaving loom and buy a new one ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T01:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T01:20:01Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chochong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoinem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaijahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dimkholam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahneilhing ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kholneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaineichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neikhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T09:34:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":497588,"name":"Mwanarusi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanarusi always dreams of being a prominent woman who is responsible in the community.

Her partner is Efren, a welder, and they have a child. Rosemarie, together with her partner, manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRosemarie operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosemarie hopes that her business will expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

He lives in the municipality of Chichigalpa, a place close to the Nicaragua Liquor Company, which is known for its production of sugar cane and spirits. Chichigalpa is also one of the hottest place in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, Bernardo was diagnosed with a chronic kidney infection, commonly known as \u201ccreatinina,\u201d or creatinine, from his childhood of harvesting sugar cane, irrigation, and fieldwork. Being diagnosed with this illness, no one will hire him in order to avoid medical expenses, despite the fact that he is a strong man still. Currently, during his medical examinations, they are asking Bernardo to do hemodialysis, which he has refused, because he says it will kill him faster, and he doesn't want to leave his only companion, his wife, all alone. \r\n\r\nBernardo wakes up at 6 in the morning everyday to do his daily chores, and then he conducts his sales business. When he can leave, he helps his wife collect her outstanding payments. This loan is to cover family expenses and to invest in his business through the purchase of clothes, sweets and cosmetics. \r\n\r\nBernardo is grateful to CEPRODEL and KIVA, because his and his family\u2019s quality of life is improving, and he calls for their continued support so that everyone who suffers from this disease will be supported.

She faced a very difficult time after the death of her husband. She recently had a uterus operation but she is still working with full delegation to provide for the family needs. She works 8 hours a day. \r\nIn spite of working full time, she takes care of all the housework and makes sure that she can fulfill all of her children's needs.  \r\n\r\nAll of the income which comes from her tailoring business goes to the household expenses due to which she is unable to save any amount for her children\u2019s future but she is very much thankful to Allah Almighty that she is having her own house to live in. \r\n\r\nHer older son owns a small shop selling fried chicken at the corner of the street but his income is insufficient and the other one did matriculation*** and took some computer courses as well but he is jobless. Her one daughter did matriculation and got married and now has 2 sons, while the youngest one has recently completed B.com (Bachelor of Commerce)\r\n\r\nGulnaz, as a member of this 6-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase fabric and a separate sewing machine for her tailoring business since she currently has only one sewing machine which she uses for her tailoring business as well as for personal use. \r\n\r\nGulnaz hopes that the loan will be beneficial to them. \r\n\r\nNote: In the picture Gulnaz holds a passbook in her hand.\r\n\r\n***See

is Sharon, 49, a resident of Taguig, Philippines. Single, she manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSharon operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands.\r\n\r\nSharon hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life by the grace of God.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \n\nMary oversees operations of their jeepney transportation business. \n\nJeepneys were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines. \n\nMary has one jeepney (14-16 person capacity). Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit.\n\nMary dreams to have a good life with her family.

Ahora sale adelante con su peque\u00f1o hijo, con quien recibi\u00f3 el reto de educarlo y sustentarlo sola. Juntos viven en Quinid\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nHace 4 a\u00f1os Stephany aprendi\u00f3 con la ayuda de una amiga la actividad de vender cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo de forma ambulante. A pesar de la separaci\u00f3n con su pareja, ella busc\u00f3 maneras de no descuidar a su hijo pero a la vez dedicando mucho tiempo a su trabajo para tener el sustento. Con la experiencia ella ha aprendido a administrar de manera correcta sus recursos y ahora que su hijo va creciendo, el salir a ofrecer los productos a sus clientes, se le facilita. Todos los d\u00edas aprovecha las oportunidades y necesidades de sus clientes que en su mayor\u00eda son mujeres.

","en":"Stephany is a young, 20-year-old woman, who has run into many challenges in her life.  One of them was that she was unable to continue her professional training, despite her hard work, and only finished high school.  Now she is trying to get ahead with her small son, and has the challenge of educating and supporting him.  They live in Quinid\u00e9 Canton in the province of Esmeraldas which supplies many cities of Ecuador with products such as bananas, cocoa, coffee, African palm and forest products.  Commerce is the main work of the population in this area, especially now that there are more roads leading into this canton, allowing for a good amount of trade, especially on weekends.  That is when all types of merchants go to the markets in search of potential customers, most of whom are farmers.  Tourism is also an important activity for this canton because of its natural ecosystem, with a variety of attractions, such as water falls, sweet water rivers, forests, and the flora and fauna that adorn the city.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Stephany learned from a friend how to sell cosmetics by catalogue, working as a street vendor.  Despite having divorced her husband, she has sought out ways to care for her son, while also working hard to support him.  With experience, she has learned how to manage her income correctly; and now that her son is growing, it is easier for her to go out to offer her products to customers.  Every day she takes advantage of the opportunities and needs of her customers, most of whom are women.  She feels ready to take the next step which is to set up business in one location.  Therefore, she has decided to establish a space in her house where she can offer discounts and sale items as a strategy to attract customers.  Stephany wants to earn more profit and spend more time with her son.  That is why she has requested a loan to fix up a space in her house (by cleaning, painting, installing display cases, etc.) to sell cosmetics.  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, thanks to work done by Kiva, was able to give her the loan and train her to run her business correctly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1237788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To fix up a space in her house to sell cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quinind\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephany Lissette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":739.2,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":64.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":75.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.66,"local_amount":64.71,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":65.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126227,"comment":null},{"amount":71.58,"local_amount":70.55,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":71.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516815,"comment":null},{"amount":72.62,"local_amount":71.58,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":72.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068671,"comment":null},{"amount":74.45,"local_amount":73.38,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":74.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494938,"comment":null},{"amount":74.78,"local_amount":73.7,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":74.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524866,"comment":null},{"amount":78.05,"local_amount":76.93,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":78.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133171,"comment":null},{"amount":78.26,"local_amount":77.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":78.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313715,"comment":null},{"amount":234.6,"local_amount":231.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":234.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565320,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-01T20:33:01Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496203,"name":"Waliou Olakor\u00e9d\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Waliou Olakor\u00e9d\u00e9 est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 57 ans et vit au B\u00e9nin.

She lives with Enel, a clerk, who is the father of their 2 children whom they love very much.  They live comfortably together in their own home which they bought through a great deal of hard work.  \r\n\r\nAzucena's business involves loading wood-drying kilns for local timber companies.  These huge metal kilns are used by wood processing companies to dry wood, which improves its quality and durability.  With the support of her partner, who works in one of the timber companies which use these services, she manages to employ up to 5 people to help her.  She set up her business more than 18 months ago using her own money and, so far, has run it single-handedly.  She believes that the business is cost-effective because it generates good profits which have enabled her to cover her household expenses.  When her partner, seeing a business opportunity, came up with the idea, she decided to set up the business to help him cover the household expenses and provide a better quality of life for their children.    \r\n\r\nNow, due to the good results she is achieving, she has plans to expand into selling clothing, another business which she knows can be profitable.  This will be her 9th loan from the MFP institution.  She is happy in the knowledge that she will have the financial support to continue with her business and is also grateful to her communal bank for the support it offers to people with businesses.  She will use the 2,500 nuevos soles which she is applying for to provide meals for those she employs to load the wood-drying kilns and to pay their wages.
