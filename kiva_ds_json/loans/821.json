He is 55 years old and has been married to Marcelina, who is a homemaker, for 38 years.  The couple live in the town of San Felipe del Progreso.  This is a town that has all the public services its people need.  The couple have four children, only one of whom is still dependent on them.  He is in his fifth year of elementary school.  Jes\u00fas has an electromechanical workshop in the town center.  He is a very hard-working and entrepreneurial person.  Although he was not able to attend school owing to the fact that there weren't many opportunities to do so when he was young, he is a person with big ideas and a great desire to do well in life.  On this occasion, he is requesting a loan to buy a field where he can grow corn, barley and beans.  He has two years experience in this business of growing crops and he tells us that he has taken the decision to buy this field because he used to work in a way which is commonly referred to as doing work by 'going halves'.  This is when one person sets up the field and another person sows the seeds and works the land.  When harvest time comes round, half of the harvested crops go to the owner of the field and the other half goes to the person who worked the land.  Although this worked well for him, he realized that he could do better if he bought his own field because this would mean that all the harvested crops would be his.  Jes\u00fas will sow crops in his field.  Some of the harvested crops will be for his own consumption and he will turn some into fertilizer.  He says that once he has harvested his crops, he will sell them in the in market San Felipe.  This whole process will take him somewhere between four and five months.  Up to now, Jes\u00fas has not experienced any difficulties in carrying out his work.  As he is a very hard-working and entrepreneurial man, he says that he would like to buy and sell lambs in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1031196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a plot of land for growing corn and stover","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"J Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2195.18},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2246.4},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2298.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2352.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2407.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2463.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2521},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2579.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2640.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2701.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2764.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2829.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.47},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":528,"local_amount":6740.4,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6759.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656759,"comment":null},{"amount":565.83,"local_amount":7223.33,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":7243.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317431,"comment":null},{"amount":399.56,"local_amount":5100.82,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5115.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418815,"comment":null},{"amount":418.43,"local_amount":5341.64,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5356.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568408,"comment":null},{"amount":438.18,"local_amount":5593.81,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5609.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399769,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T06:46:32Z","paid_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408221,"name":"Dolores De La Concepci\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Dolores de la Concepci\u00f3n, es madre soltera con 3 hijos todos menores de edad originaria de la ciudad de le\u00f3n;

He feeds them, takes them out to pasture, etc.  He believes that his business is doing very well because he is very committed to his work and, above all, because he raises his animals in good conditions and his customers feel safe when they buy from him.\r\n\r\nLuis is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to buy nutritionally-balanced feed for his cattle.  This will allow him to better feed his animals and they will put on more weight.  As a result, when he sells his animals they will weigh more and his income will improve.  He will continue working every day in order to fulfill his biggest dream: to enable his children to obtain a university degree and to improve his cattle pens."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1054649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed for his livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283091357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T15:42:03Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T11:33:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409109,"name":"La Paix Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"LA PAIX est un groupe compos\u00e9 de quatre personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame quartier.

is Fanta. She is 34, married, and has five children aged 16, 13, 11, 7, and 5 years. She also has two additional dependents who live with her because she assists them with their schooling.  \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fanta established her business. She began her business because, after her father's death when she was a child, there was no one to support her. Her mother gave her in marriage to a contractor, who gave her money to start a business. Working seven days a week and 14 hours a day, she earns about 1,500,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nFanta would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. Fanta has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy cigarettes, water, and biscuits for sale and to pay employees.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fanta plans to build a house and acquire a shop.

a la que se dedican y fresno por el lugar donde viven.\nDo\u00f1a Rufina tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad esta casada desde hace 32 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Santiago quien trabaja de obrero y agricultor aun tienen un ni\u00f1o  Aron Santiago que depende de ellos el cual est\u00e1 estudiando la primaria.\nDo\u00f1a Rufina se dedica al bordado nos cuenta que ya hace 32 a\u00f1os que se dedica a bordar, colchas, gabanes, chales, esquemesnes, tapetes con figuras representativas de la comunidad, las cuales son estrellas de trencillas, bordados de casita, figuras de caballo, y otros animalitos con el cr\u00e9dito otorgado do\u00f1a Rufina comprara tela de lana, tela estambron, estambre de madeja para bordar, aujas, tijeras, etc.\nUna de las dificultades mas grandes que presenta do\u00f1a Rufina es que casi no se vende ya nuestra artesan\u00eda porque las personas no quieren pagar el precio a que se le da al cliente se le hace muy caro y muchas veces nuestro trabajo no es valorado como deber\u00eda ser. Do\u00f1a Rufina comenta que para la elaboraci\u00f3n de dichos art\u00edculos se tardan de 20 d\u00edas hasta un mes dependiendo del art\u00edculo que vayan hacer.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que FRAC y Kiva les realizan al grupo de las Artesanas del Fresno es de gran ayuda ya que muchas veces no tiene para comprar sus materiales para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus actividades.\nPor lo que ellas est\u00e1n muy agrdecidas por el pr\u00e9stamo otorgado por lo que resto del grupo invierte en: Angelina, Maria Juana, Lucina, Maria de los Angeles, Leonila, Maria Lucina invertiran en bordados de artesanias y Maria Iris en productos de Belleza. \n\n","en":"The \u201cLas Artesanas del Fresno\u201d (The Ash Tree Artisans) group is located in Fresno Nichi a place where trees predominate.  It\u2019s composed of nine women who are all embroidery craftswomen.  The group is called Las Artesanas del Fresno precisely because of the activity they carry out and \u2018fresno\u2019 because of the place they live in.\r\n\r\nRufina, 52, has been married to Santiago, who works as a laborer and farmer, for 32 years; they still have a little boy, Aron Santiago, who depends on them and is attending elementary school.\r\n\r\nRufina is an embroiderer and she mentions that she\u2019s been doing this for 32 years; she embroiders bedspreads, ponchos, shawls, \"quexquemetl\" [embroidered lace cape], mats with figures representative of the community such as braided stars, embroidered little houses, horses and other little animals.  With the granted loan, Rufina will buy wool fabric, embroidery fabric, Madeja-style yarn, needles, scissors, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of Rufina\u2019s greatest difficulties is that their type of crafts hardly sell anymore because people don\u2019t want to pay the prices quoted to customers; they think they are too expensive and often their work is undervalued.  Rufina relates that it takes from 20 days to a month depending on the item to be made to complete said items.\r\n\r\nThe loan that FRAC and Kiva will provide for the Las Artesanas del Fresno group is of great help for them because often they are unable to buy the materials they need to make their items.  Because of this, they are very grateful for the loan granted that the entire group will invest:  Angelina, Maria Juana, Lucina, Maria de los Angeles, Leonila, Maria and Lucina will invest in their artisanal embroidery work and Maria Iris in beauty products.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1044468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy fabric for embroidery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juna Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Lucina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":4125,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4160.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044559,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8321.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656765,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8321.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317437,"comment":null},{"amount":975,"local_amount":12375,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":12481.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418821,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T13:50:57Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408653,"name":"Anecita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anecita is 49 years old and married with three children, ages 20, 18 and 13.

She is married with two sons.  The elder is attending secondary school, and the younger is two years old.  \r\n\r\nNorma sells tamales, bread and yogurt.  She is requesting a loan to purchase flour, butter, sugar, yeast, corn, meat, and lard.  She started her business four years ago.  She signed on with a baker and saw how to prepare bread, and in this way she learned to bake bread and her mom taught her to make tamales.  She enjoys baking bread and selling it.  She sells her customers sweet bread, rolls, holiday bread with nuts and raisins, and tamales.  Her business is important to her, because she gets income for her son who is attending school.

She requests this loan because she buys and sells sheep and chickens and also for feed and medicine to raise them with. She comments that she buys the chicks at her town\u2019s veterinary so that they will be healthy and sometimes she also buys them in her community; she buys the sheep in her community.  \r\n\r\nShe raises them at home and clears them of parasites in order to sell them later on.  She comments that it usually takes her four months to sell her chickens and up to a year to sell a little lamb.  She has three years\u2019 experience in this type of business so she knows she\u2019ll do very well.  \u201cWhat I do is raise my little animals and when they are ready I sell them earning profits.  I reinvest the money and also use it for food for my family. To date, the only problem I\u2019ve faced is that sometimes my little animals get sick, especially the little lambs, and they sometimes die of their illnesses.  But I\u2019m sure and I trust that everything will turn out very well because I want to continue working hard because in the future I\u2019d like to start a napkin and thread business,\u201d Rosa comments hopefully.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":1031153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Rancher\u00eda la Carrera","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Esthela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":41000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1209.38,"local_amount":15375,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":15482.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656775,"comment":null},{"amount":806.25,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10321.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317447,"comment":null},{"amount":1209.37,"local_amount":15375,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":15482.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418831,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-01T16:39:23Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408385,"name":"Mildred","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mildred de 30 a\u00f1os es la propietaria de una miscel\u00e1nea al sur de la ciudad, donde vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus dos hijos en las edades de 7 a 10 a\u00f1os.

Her business grew so fast that she soon ran out of working capital.  She decided to order directly from her supplier to get a better margin and, in turn, better pricing for her customers.  She is applying to Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo for a Kiva loan that she will use to stock her business with underwear, perfumes, jewelry and creams.

\u201cEl Tr\u00e9bol de las Flores\u201d and is composed of ten hardworking, humble women from Santiago Pinotepa, a place where most citizens are indigenous and still wear \u201cnaguas\u201d and \u201chuipiles\u201d [traditional skirts and blouses].\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Leticia Araceli, 36.  She is a single mother and she tells us that she has been selling jewelry for the last 7 years.  What she likes best about her business is having her customers\u2019 orders ready on time since most of the orders are gifts for weddings, 15th birthday parties, 1st communions, baptisms and birthdays.\r\n\r\nLeti, as she\u2019s better known by her group members, tells us that she used to organize \u201ctandas\u201d [informal group savings schemes] but she\u2019s always wanted to have her own business so she started to buy a little bit of jewelry in the month of June when children get out of school and vacations start and she noticed that it was a good business so she used her profits to buy more merchandise like earrings, chains, bracelets and hoop earrings.\r\n\r\nWith support from the Fundaci\u00f3n she was able to buy more things both in gold and silver to obtain more profits since her younger customers like children in secondary school want less expensive items; this is when she decided to sell silver.\r\n\r\nLeti tells us that she always works with love since with her profits and effort she's been able to provide an education for her daughter that she loves and wants to support since she\u2019s both mother and father to her greatest treasure, her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more jewelry merchandise like earrings, chains, necklaces, bracelets and hoop earrings.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she\u2019s very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for supporting single mothers who want their children to go to school.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nLourdes Patricia- sells groceries.\r\nAdriana- sells perfume.\r\nErika

She's never had access to low-interest loan and her sales have fallen because there's a lot of competition in her neighborhood.  \r\nDo\u00f1a Lupita hopes this loan will allow her to recoup some of the business that she's lost and notes, mischievously, that many new businesses soon close.  \r\n\"I am very grateful to FRAC and KIVA\", she say, \"because this loan will help me stock my grocery\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1054765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to stock her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La concepcion, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":597.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":611.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":639.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":670.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":685.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":701.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":718.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":734.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":752.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":769.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":787.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":805.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":824.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":843.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":863.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":883.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":904.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":925.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":415.43,"local_amount":5303.35,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5318.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656782,"comment":null},{"amount":293.36,"local_amount":3745.01,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3755.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317453,"comment":null},{"amount":466.21,"local_amount":5951.64,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5968.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418837,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-31T22:19:40Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408665,"name":"Khishigdelger","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Khishigdelger, who is 44, runs a small translation bureau with her husband in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

For the past two years, Prisca has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells milk. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prisca has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase milk for resale, and will help Prisca to generate greater profits to pay for medical expenses and other family needs.  Prisca hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nPrisca is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

She has 2 children ages 6 and 1 year, and only 1 child goes to school. Constance is in the Agriculture business of poultry and has been in the business for a year now. She is currently operating her business from her place of residence and has an employee who helps her on a part time basis. \r\n\r\nConstance has requested a loan of $250 to buy stock feeds.

Hip\u00f3lito is 45 years old and married to Juana.  He still has four children who depend on them and their 13 year old daughter is still attending school.  Hip\u00f3lito and his family work baking bread to sell.  He\u2019s asked for the loan to buy flour, milk, yeast and firewood because although he lives in a place where trees abound he cannot cut the trees down and firewood must be brought from another state.\r\n\r\nHe described to us how he makes the bread:  \u201cFirst I knead the dough until it\u2019s shaped to make bread.  Then I separate the dough into 120 gram portions for each piece of bread.  In another spot the bread is shaped usually into rounds but I also choose which will be made: small, large and medium.  Once formed they pass into the wood-burning oven where I have to be watchful and very careful while they are baking turning them over and over again so that they don\u2019t burn.\u201d\r\n\r\nHip\u00f3lito has been baking mountain bread for a long time.  He learned from his grandfather when he was 8 years old and when he turned 15 he started his own business.  \u201cThe problem I face is that often resources are lacking since flour is very expensive.  On the other hand, we are not allowed to touch the wood and I have to bring it in from someplace else and it is super expensive that way.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of his goals is to have a mixer to make the bread more easily because by producing more his profits will increase.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very grateful for the loan authorized by FRAC and KIVA because it\u2019s very difficult to get loans from  other financial institutions because the interest rates they charge are very high.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1054745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"\r\nto buy flour, sugar, milk, firewood and yeast.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Guadalupe Cote, San Felipe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hitolipo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":597.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":611.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":639.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":670.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":685.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":701.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":718.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":734.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":752.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":769.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":787.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":805.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":824.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":843.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":863.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":883.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":904.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":925.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":15041.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-17T01:32:48Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408730,"name":"Essam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Essam is from Gaza.

a los articulos del ocochal, ya armados Magalli puede venderlos al mejor precio que ella cree conveniente.\nElla solo vende en temporadas se podria decir que es una de sus dificultades ya que no tiene oportunidad de vender en varias acaciones sus clientes llegan a pedirle encargos o pedidos para ocaciones especiales, pero son muy pocas veces, una de sus metas que tiene es titularse en Psicologia ya que por el momento solo tiene la carta pasante y le gustaria llegar a titularse y trabajar como Psicologa, \"Estoy muy agradecida con el credito que FRAC Y KIVA me otorgaron ya gracias al credito que

They operate businesses making and selling \"ocochal\" (a traditional craft).  The members live in the town of El Oro, a beautiful place with houses that seem to belong to another time.  \r\nMagalli, 22, is single.  She just finished a degree in psychology and lives with her parents.  She is applying for a loan that she will use to buy supplies of brass.  She will make ocochal placemats and other tableware.  She will use the supply of brass to decorate her ocochal products, something that will allow her to fetch a better price for them.  \r\nMagalli says that her customers only want her products at certain times of the year, something that's a problem for her because she can't sell year-round.  She wants to go back to school to complete a higher degree in psychology because she only has a \"carta pasante\" now and she'd like to get an advanced degree that would allow her to work as a psychologist.  \"I am very grateful to FRAC and KIVA for helping me\", she says, \"because past loans have helped me to to make the products that I sell\".  She adds that her income from the business paid her school fees, books, etc.  \r\nThe other members are also grateful for your loans.

group is called \u201cEmiliano Zapata Jicayan\u201d and is composed of four indigenous women from San Juanito Jicayan, a pretty town inhabited by honorable people.  Just outside of San Juanito there is a large river with green trees.  The members of this group speak Mixteco and they tell us that they are proud of being from San Juanito and of their culture and language.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Irlanda, a 26 year old, hardworking woman.  She tells us that she considers herself to be a hardworking, humble woman who wants to improve herself.  She sells candy and food like: chicken turnovers, tostadas, fried tacos and sopes [a circle of fried masa with pinched sides. This is then topped with refried beans and crumbled cheese, lettuce, onions, red or green sauce and sour cream. \r\n\r\nShe relates one of her work experiences:\r\n\r\nShe relates that she used to just sell candy at a school but with support from the Fundaci\u00f3n she bought ingredients to prepare dishes like: green chili, dried chilies, tomatoes, onions, cheese, cold cuts, string cheese and corn to make tortillas.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her business is that little by little and with work she\u2019s made it grow and with her same profits to prepare more dishes.

Her business is based out of her apartment.  She purchases materials for her business such as rubber, fique fiber, micro suit fabric, insoles, and packing material.  She designs the shoes and then takes the materials to a cobbler who makes the shoes for her.  Once the shoes are finished Beatriz packs them up and delivers them to her customers.  She also makes handbags, though that is a smaller part of her business.  She sells her items for cash and for credit.  Beatriz gets new customers through the Internet, on Facebook, in street markets, and by handing out fliers and business cards.  She also sells to two stores in Santa Marta.  The competition is low, and she meets the competition with the quality of her products, her success in fulfilling orders, and the overall satisfaction of her customers.  Her shoes are very beautiful and original with ecological patterns.  Her business has directly created two jobs\u2014hers and the cobbler\u2019s\u2014and contributes to the business of the two vendors who sell her products in the city of Santa Marta.         \r\n\r\nBeatriz has an excellent financial record.  Her business is small, since she sells most of her products for cash.  Her infrastructure is adequate for this type of business, and her financial record reflects an economic situation that is both stable and solvent.  However, as Beatriz\u2019s clientele expands, her biggest challenge is having enough working capital to purchase materials for her business.  That is why she has decided to take out a loan.  This is Beatriz\u2019s first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and she will use it for working capital.  She will use it to maintain a cash fund for purchasing the materials she needs to produce shoes and handbags, which she will sell wholesale and retail.  Beatriz also wants to register her brand with the relevant government agencies, since that has been one of her goals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1053459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase materials for making shoes and handbags.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":108527},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":126926},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":129887},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":132918},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":136019},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":139193},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":142441},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":145765},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":149166},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":152646},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":156208},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":180304}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.24,"local_amount":108527,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":109237.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141168,"comment":null},{"amount":72.8,"local_amount":126926,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:04Z","rounded_local_amount":127756.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101048,"comment":null},{"amount":74.49,"local_amount":129887,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":130737,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338669,"comment":null},{"amount":76.24,"local_amount":132918,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":133787.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395233,"comment":null},{"amount":78.01,"local_amount":136019,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":136909.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775039,"comment":null},{"amount":161.52,"local_amount":281634,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":283477.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993890,"comment":null},{"amount":83.6,"local_amount":145765,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":146718.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130253,"comment":null},{"amount":173.1,"local_amount":301812,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":303787.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519143,"comment":null},{"amount":193,"local_amount":336512,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":338714.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527079,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T14:48:24Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408772,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema, a married mother of five children, four of whom are in school, lives in Kampala, Uganda where she resides in a home that she owns; she has access to electricity and piped water. <p>\r\n\r\nFor the past eight years Rehema has had a business selling bananas.

has sold chickens for three.\r\n<p>She says that what she enjoys most about selling chickens is caring for them since she likes waking up early to happily feed them corn and sometimes gets the nixtamal (corn flour mix) to make tortillas and gives them a little in a tray with water for them to eat.\r\n<p>Mrs. Edna is happily married to Mr. Julio who is forty-seven years old; they have four children named Lizbeth, Edna Melisa, Sandra Liliana and Jonatan.\r\n<p>Her children say they are very proud of their mother since she is a hardworking woman as well as humble and proud of her

The members of this group decided to take this name as there are trees near where they live that go by the name of ocotal, from which they obtain firewood.  This group is made up of five men and two women, who are very friendly and helpful.  They are very sociable, like to joke around, and are very accessible to each other, but above all they are very responsible.  One of the main activities that takes place in this community is growing vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe names of the members and their respective activities are as follow: \r\n1.- Alfredo G. (will purchase blender cups for sale)\r\n2.- Abel E. (will purchase resin figures for sale) \r\n3.- Ernestina M.

They have seven children together, of whom only three currently are still financially dependent on him. \r\n\r\nDon Alfredo is requesting this loan as he works selling plastics in particular selling cups to use with blenders.  He has six years of experience in this.  Every week or two when he needs merchandise, he goes to a community very near to his village which is called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec.  Here he stocks up on everything he needs.  He goes door-to-door selling his products, and on occasion, he sells in the market.

She started a business selling dairy products by the road and in streets in her neighborhood. She later she went to Carmen de Bol\u00edvar, her native land, and bought her first products.

She needs a credikiva, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy cheese, groceries, dairy products as well as meat since it is widely sold.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Maricel also sells cellphone loads for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 3,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMaricel hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is married to Criselda, a housewife and mother to their children. He, together with his wife and children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEdwin operates a food stall. He cooks breakfast meals like congee, a mixture of glutinous rice, eggs or chicken, and spices, along with other breakfast meals that he offers. He buys his ingredients early in the morning and prepares them for his customers upon order. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, he is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. He will utilize the loan to buy greater quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. He expects a boost in his income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nEdwin hopes to grow his business in the coming years, just as he hopes to support his children's schooling up to the college level.

Nawal has worked as a tailor for 10 years. She started her business to help her husband make a living and raise their children. She stopped working for a few years when she found out that her children needed a lot of care and attention, but two years ago Nawal felt lonely since all of her children got married and she was left alone during the day busy with nothing to prepare for the kids who were supposed to be back home for lunch or dinner.\r\n\r\nSo working again was the best thing for her to improve her social life in addition to supporting her family again with additional income for whoever needs help. She is very happy that she took this path again, and she is willing to open a big factory in the future. Today, Nawal is applying for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy a new and improved tailoring machine capable of doing a lot of work in a very short amount of time with especially good quality.\r\n\r\nKhadija is a 25-year-old married woman and mother of three gorgeous children who fill her whole life, and for whom she sacrifices hers in order to please them and provide them with the best living ever. Three years ago, Khadija started to work as a hairdresser. She faced a lot of problems and complaints from her husband at the beginning since he refused to let her work and start her own business. But at the same time, she had her husband's family's support, which helped a lot in taking the first step. Her business started at home, since her husband spends most of his time away and she had to fill her free time and at the same time stay next to her children. Most of her customers are friends, relatives and neighbors. Khadija is applying for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy necessary hair colors, a new hairdryer and necessary hair dressing tools to improve her business. She hopes that one day she will open her own beauty salon and all of her customers will support her there too since they are very loyal to her. She is sure that her husband, although he refused at the beginning, is very proud of her now.\r\n\r\nZalfa is a 43-year-old married woman and mother of three children. Zalfa has been working in the Mouneh business for 13 years. She inherited her business from her mother who used to do it in her village. That's what encouraged her to start this business in her husband's village. Zalfa makes jam, she prepares Mouneh during the summer months to be consumed during winter\u2019s harsh days. This way of preserving food helps foods to live a longer life. The Mouneh food has started in time to be a basic food for most of the Lebanese. Her business is improving and now is the suitable time to start working since everything is almost available to start preparing. That's why, to be ready for customers' replies, Zalfa is requesting a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy necessary goods such as vegetables, fruits and seeds , to start her preparations.

nine kind, working women who run different businesses.  The members of the group live in a village called Camotinchan which has many green trees and a wide, beautiful river winding through it called \"Los Tres\" (because it has three streams).\r\n\r\nMost of the men in the community grow corn, sesame, chili pepper, and tomato; and the women sell chicken, shoes and beef.  In the culture of Camotinchan, during carnival the boys and girls dance in the streets in their community.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Mrs. Josellesica, a cheerful, hard-working woman who wants to help her family.  She is known as Jessica among the group members and people in her communty.  She sells Mexican snacks, gelatin, water, fresh fruit and sweets at the high school in her community.  She says she has been selling there for two years, and before that she sold her goods at the kindergarten for thirteen years. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Jessica, 32, is happily married to Ignacio, a humble, hard-working man who is a farmer.  They have three children, Jonatan, 16, Javier, 13 and Alexander, 2, who are their greatest inspiration.\r\n\r\nJessica tells us that what she likes most about her business is cooking for the youngsters and treating them well.  She says her workday is as follows: she takes her goods to the high school and when the students begin recess she sells them food and fruit.  Her son, Javier, and her nephew, Daniel, help by attending to everyone more quickly so they can play a little before returning to class.  What she enjoys most is feeling like she's the mother of all the youngsters.\r\n\r\nShe adds that the teachers support her as far as being able to sell at school, since there were two ladies vying for the business; but thanks to the teachers she was the one chosen.  She is very content, and even moreso with the support of the foundation, which has allowed her to buy more merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy more fruit and food ingredients such as dry chili pepper, green pepper, dough to make tortillas, and cheese. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nMaria \u2013 who sells clothing.\r\nConstancia - who sells chicken.\r\nAmelia -

Mohamed has already received and successfully repaid three loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy additional palm oil and local rice. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 250,000. In the future, Mohamed plans to expand the shop from a makeshift store to a concrete building. The loan can increase his profit margin and make him sustainable.

He is a professional electrician in Jamoat. Due to his small salary, he also runs his own business raising and selling livestock. Each week he goes to the Sunday livestock market and resells goats and sheep. Having bought sheep at a low price in the early morning, he later resells them at the same market at a profit, since the price of livestock increases throughout the day. Bahodur also keeps two grown cows that give 6 liters of milk per day, and his wife sells the milk to their neighbours. Using his next loan, Bahodur would like to buy 2 cows and fodder for them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1060097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to expand his
