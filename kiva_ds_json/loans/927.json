Sus principales clientes son amas de casa y empleados que le pagan semanal, mensual o quincenal de acuerdo a las posibilidades de cada uno, pero a corto plazo. En la actualidad no accede a clientes efectivos, con quienes pudiera negociar si le ofreciera plazos m\u00e1s amplios y esto se convierte en uno de sus mayores desaf\u00edos. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, segundo financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 marcos, lienzos y pinturas en mayor volumen, para ofrecerle mejores condiciones de pago a su clientela y ganar un mayor n\u00famero de ellos.

","en":"Walter is 20 years old and the father of a 2-year-old son. He is an inspired young artist who paints pictures on canvas. He sends them to a framing shop and sells them. He has had business experience since he was 15, when he learned to profit from the products of his inspiration and make it his own lifestyle that would generate income for him. His principal customers are homemakers and employees who pay him weekly, monthly, or every two weeks, according to each one's ability, but in the short term. Now he does not have access to clients with whom he could negotiate if he offered longer term loans, and this has become one of his greatest challenges. This is why he is turning to a Kiva loan, which will be the second financing that he has had with Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and with which he will buy frames, canvases, and paint in greater quantities, in order to offer better payment terms to his customers and win a larger number of them. Walter is a hard-working young man who goes out every day with his paintings and offers them door-to-door throughout the the city of Cartagena, always seeking to sell more each time. His goal is to end the year with an increase in his loan portfolio and succeed in responding to all the challenges that entrepreneurial activity brings with it, since he is very young and has the ability to achieve his dream of prosperity, which is nothing other than improving his quality of life and that of his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1166100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy frames,

is a mother who has two school-age children. She aims to become financially stable to improve their living status and give her children a better life. To generate income, she owns and manages a variety store in their village while her husband operates their farmland. Due to the high cost of commodities and school fees, they need to increase their income to cover their needs and finance the education of their children. \r\n\r\nIn this regard, Nerita aims to improve her variety store to earn sufficient income. Due to insufficient capital, she is requesting a loan for PHP 25,000.00 to buy additional stocks of grocery items like soft drinks, canned goods, beverages, detergent soaps, eggs and seasonings to sell. She believes that this financial assistance will enable her to work out her plan and is hoping that she will improve the business and make it a viable source of income in the future.

Irene hopes that, in the future, she will be able to expand her business into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nIrene is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1170481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every table in an Azerbaijan family and they also make fresh punch. Her monthly income is 120 AZN. Raising crops takes a lot of strength and, working in the open air, is very hard for a woman. That why her spouse helps. \r\n\r\nSafura needs additional capital to invest in seeds and fertilizers as well as new garden tools. This will allow her to improve the quality of products she raisea and to increase her monthly turnover. For this purpose she has applied for 1500 AZN.

He is married and a father to one son and one daughter.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Haitham has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and the only source of income for the family. Haitham is requesting a USD youth loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of licensing and insuring the taxi and purchasing a new engine for the taxi he drives. This will increase the taxi's capacity to work extra hours and enable Haitham to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nHaitham is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees.

is a conservative woman who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband Kamal appears in her Kiva profile photo. Ansam is 30 years old and the mother of three daughters. For the past two years, Ansam's husband has earned a living by running a grocery store.  It has been profitable, but the only source of income for the family and it does not bring in enough money to cover the family's costs. Ansam is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her husband buy more groceries to sell, including rice, sugar and  milk. This will increase sales and the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is its prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit into this cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The loan amount you see here includes both the loan principal loan and the servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

They live together in a house of their own, which they bought with a lot of effort. Ruth's activity is the sale of regional fruits, such as melons and watermelons. In the morning, she sets up a table in the front of her house, where she serves her customers. She also has another business, selling beauty products by catalog. She sells them among her friends and family. She started the fruit selling business with a loan from MFP and so far she has been doing it on her own. She considers it to be profitable because of the earnings she gets and for being the only one in her neighborhood. Before she started, she wanted to to be a productive person and generate an income of her own, so she didn't have to depend completely on her partner and to be able to support him with the household expenses. Therefore, seeing the results, she wishes to go on and invest in another business, like a groceries store in her house. This is her 4th loan with MFP and she is happy to know that she will continue to get the financial support she needs to materialize her plans. Besides, she feels comfortable with her communal bank, because it is a close and supportive group. With the requested loan (800 nuevos soles), she will invest in the purchase of more melons and watermelons."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1167014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more melons and watermelons for sale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-20T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-19T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":127.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":127.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":137.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":142.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":145.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.72,"local_amount":119.93,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:01Z","rounded_local_amount":127.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456580,"comment":null},{"amount":51.86,"local_amount":127.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":135.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452246,"comment":null},{"amount":51.67,"local_amount":127.17,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":135.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447422,"comment":null},{"amount":55.72,"local_amount":137.16,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":145.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053322,"comment":null},{"amount":57.8,"local_amount":142.28,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":151.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188248,"comment":null},{"amount":59.23,"local_amount":145.8,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":155.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572166,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-21T22:26:50Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":460403,"name":"Gemima","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gemima tiene 36 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy generosa, amable y trabajadora.

As a street vendor, she has a loudspeaker to attract people's attention. Her first business was selling sweets and candy, but thanks to what she earned with it and a loan with field partner MFP, she was able to start selling fish.

She dedicates the other half to taking care of her family. This is her ninth loan with field partner MFP and she feels very happy knowing that she has financial backing, since it gives her the security of being able to continue working without worrying.

In the future she\u2019d like to build a cement house because hers is made of sugarcane stalks to provide her children with a safer future because the sector they live in is very dangerous."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1167572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-08-20T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-19T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedicta Albertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1571.49,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":98},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":99.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":101.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":105.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":106.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.27},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":114.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":116.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":119.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":121.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":179.84,"local_amount":179.44,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":179.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096882,"comment":null},{"amount":94.04,"local_amount":93.83,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":94.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331237,"comment":null},{"amount":95.16,"local_amount":94.95,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":95.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939878,"comment":null},{"amount":98.22,"local_amount":98,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":98.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072299,"comment":null},{"amount":99.57,"local_amount":99.35,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":99.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318656,"comment":null},{"amount":208.01,"local_amount":207.55,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":208.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013399,"comment":null},{"amount":106.12,"local_amount":105.88,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:39Z","rounded_local_amount":106.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459603,"comment":null},{"amount":110.01,"local_amount":109.76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":110.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087928,"comment":null},{"amount":584.03,"local_amount":582.73,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":584.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381632096,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-18T03:41:02Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:13:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":462052,"name":"Sophia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophia is thirty years old and has one child.

To do this she needs to invest in more merchandise.  This way her store will be gradually growing, and she will have the products on hand that her customers need.\r\n\r\nMaria Eduwiges is a very enterprising person.  She used to work in a personal residence where she helped out with the household chores.  She saved her money, and with a lot of effort she opened her small business and thus became a merchant.  This way she could leave her job and become her own boss.

is a 50-year-old clergy member. He is married and has two kids. In 2003, Knox established a social welfare group out of the need to offer financial literacy and solutions to his congregation, which is composed of rural disadvantaged families. Through this social welfare group, Knox would arrange for seminars and field days through which his congregation would be trained on how to save and on good farming practices. The same members would also pool their savings together and offer some short-term loans to some of their members to repay with a small amount of interest. \n\nIn 2005, Knox registered his group as a microfinance and consulting institution named Rural Economic Empowerment Programme (REEP). He hoped to mobilise savings from the church members and advance loans to the less fortunate in the church by facilitating them to pay school fees, buy farm inputs, buy water harvesting tanks and improve their general living standards. REEP grew within a few years and Knox recruited members from other denominations and also expanded to other towns because of the good advocacy the institution was getting through its members. Today, REEP has enrolled over 400 groups and has a network presence in central, eastern, and coastal Kenya. \n\nIn response to the high cost of kerosene for lighting the members' households, REEP introduced solar lanterns from BrazAfric to its members by financing the members to buy these solar lamps. The demand for the solar lamps soon became too high, so REEP, due to limited cash flow, could not buy an adequate supply of solar lamps to meet the high demand. Knox has been enjoying some credit terms to pay for the lamps in 30 days. He is now seeking to purchase solar lamps worth $2,000 for his members through Kiva financing. \n\nOn the uploaded photo is Knox with Sera- a member of one of his group called St Anne's Self help group in Voi, who purchased a solar lantern on loan from REEP. She has since finished repaying for the solar lamp and no longer has to spend so much money on buying Kerosene but rather she is happy that she can save now some extra money for food and school fees.   \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1164582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for solar lanterns","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":213,"posted_date":"2012-08-21T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-20T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Knox ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088221,"comment":null},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339477882,"comment":null},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347030660,"comment":null},{"amount":666.66,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775275,"comment":null},{"amount":333.35,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":333.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482227,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-21T10:37:17Z","paid_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":462293,"name":"Hiep","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hiep is requesting a new loan to expand her business by buying more clothes from different suppliers to satisfy her customers.

She has formed a group of three female members to seek a new loan. She and one of her group members are seeking for 500,000 KHR each while the remaining member is applying for 700,000 KHR. As the group leader, she will use her portion to buy fertilizer and to pay for harvesting costs. She hopes that this loan will assist her during this harvesting season so as to receive a larger yield and make more income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1171471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer and to pay harvesting fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Kror Kor district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-08-21T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-20T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Song","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":850000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":863387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339641096,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":253937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197117,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":253937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046465,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":355512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390695800,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-21T09:23:58Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T14:12:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":462310,"name":"Cipriano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cipriano is 43 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She manages to grow paddy rice on two and half hectares of farmland for the last 17 years and has been able to earn about 15,000 KHR per day. To add to her income, her husband not only helps her in the rice field, but also raises pigs at home and works for others for a pay. However, sometimes she gets low crop yield due to the drought and the lack of working capital; it is the main challenge that she has encountered.

is 42-year-old Daramy. He is married and has one child, aged 12 years old. He has one additional dependent living with him.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Daramy established his tailoring business. He began his business because he wanted to improve himself and his family. Working six days a week and ten hours a day, he earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan of Le 5,000,000.

Selling fish and chicken meat is the main source of her family's income, which she has been in this kind of business for twenty years. \r\n\r\nThis is Yon's second loan with VisionFund.

According to Jamila, before taking a loan from the Kashf foundation their household situation was not very good, but when she started her own work and began to help her family, her family situation became much better. \r\n\r\nShe started this business at a very low level; she used to deliver her handmade products only within the village on occasion, but now she has established contacts with shopkeepers. To complete her current orders she needs pearls, thread, needles, etc. For this purpose she requested Kashf to provide a loan of 15,000 Pakistan Rupees (PKR). \r\n\r\nShe has a strong motive to enhance the living standards of her family and provide a good education and health facilities for them.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.
