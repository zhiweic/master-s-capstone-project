He is a farmer mainly involved in the growing of maize for commercial purposes. Peter also has a poultry farm at his home operated by his wife as an additional source of income, especially when the season for maize is off.\r\n\r\nPeter has approached Ugafode to get a loan of 1,500,000 Ugandan shillings to be used for agriculture, especially for preparing the land for the next season, harvesting the current maize he has and also expanding the poultry business.\r\n\r\nPeter's dream is to buy more land and start growing maize on a larger scale for more harvest and profits. However, Peter says that the major challenges to this are having limited capital, the seasonality for agriculture, as well as the price fluctuation for agricultural produce on the market. In the photograph, Peter is on the left, and the Ugafode credit officer is also shown in the client's maize garden.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1398735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To hire labor for plowing the land and harvesting maize.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kagadi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-08-03T04:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-02T04:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480926,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880075,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983733,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635833,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863275,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T13:36:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591291,"name":"Henrique","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"  Henriques casado e pai de7 filhos, 3 que frequentam escola em diferentes n\u00edveis, outros vivem juntados e s\u00e3o menores, e vive na casa pr\u00f3pria.

Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":112.5,"image":{"id":1398753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-08-03T05:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-02T05:30:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nirmala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3583.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400621704,"comment":null},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410196587,"comment":null},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419960036,"comment":null},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429613929,"comment":null},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840391,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-03T07:23:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":589067,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis is a permanent resident of Kabingo in Isingiro district.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":162.5,"image":{"id":1398761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-08-03T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-02T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5175.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400621705,"comment":null},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2587.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410196588,"comment":null},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2587.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419960037,"comment":null},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2587.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429613930,"comment":null},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2587.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840392,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-03T08:13:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":589074,"name":"Kalpana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kalpana is 35 years old.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

I initially stayed with an uncle, however there were times when he couldn't afford school tuition and I had to stay home. One morning, while walking aimlessly, a man called out to me and asked me to buy him food and some wood sanding discs. When I returned, he wanted to pay for my services. I politely and humbly declined but on his insistence, I accepted a plate of cooked rice and beans. His show of love and appreciation endeared him to me, to the extent that I became his errand boy. With time, a friendship developed and I became fascinated with his craft... he was a wood carver. He trained me well and eventually I became a carver in my own right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank God for bringing Novica to Ghana, and may God bless the people who are funding my microcredit.

The company will design and manufacture the Reggaeton clothing brand and various accessory products. The clothing line reflects the hottest and trendiest new musical phenomena Reggaeton (R) Lifestyle, a blend of reggae and rap. The clothing retail hopes to expand this trend through its store. Ebel is looking for a microloan to fund its clothing inventory. \r\n\r\nEbel's narrative on his background:\r\n\"I was born to hard working parents, my father a mechanic and mother, a seamstress. The family migrated to Los Angeles, California, in the early 80's. In the US, my father continued to work as a mechanic. My mother opened her start up apparel manufacturer as a sub-contractor, doing work to various brands. \r\n\r\nIn late 1990, I was exposed to a brand new genre of music named Reggaeton (a mixture of tropical beats with rap lyrics).  I noticed that this music united Hispanics from different countries together. No other music genre had done [this] before. I envisioned a brand which caters to Americans of Latin American decents and Latin worldwide. Since, I am a proud owner of the trademarked Dog log and the registered Reggaeton\u00ae brand.

He studied hard in middle school and took extra classes in order to have a deeper knowledge of subjects such as mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics. After finishing middle school, he was unable to go to university, and so he entered the preparatory department of the Medical University. Currently, he is a student at the Medical University of Tajikistan and needs to pay his tuition.  His parents did not have the money to pay for his tuition.

With this loan, Mrs. Fatoumata hopes to achieve an average monthly revenue of 42,000 West African francs, one part of which will be reinvested in her business and the other used to cover the costs of condiments for her household.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1020.83,"image":{"id":1403012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy firewood and charcoal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-08-03T22:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-02T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djahara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":100880.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924418,"comment":null},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100880.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207601,"comment":null},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":100880.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972283,"comment":null},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":100880.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624844,"comment":null},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":100880.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850844,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T19:07:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591672,"name":"Filomena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Filomena de 48 a\u00f1os de edad , est\u00e1 casada con Zenobio y tiene 3 hijos con quienes vive en su casa construida a base de madera.

Ellos viven en la misma comunidad donde la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes se dedica al comercio. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron precisamente porque tres de los integrantes se dedican al cultivo de Flores para arreglos florales. Do\u00f1a Domitila o Domi, como le dicen de cari\u00f1o, platica que tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada con el se\u00f1or Juan desde hace ya varios a\u00f1os, ya no tienen ning\u00fan hijo que dependa de ellos todos han crecido y se mantienen econ\u00f3micamente. Ella solo estudio la secundaria pero es una mujer muy trabajadora su responsabilidad es lo que la distingue. Ella se dedica al cultivo de abono org\u00e1nico  para su venta hay dos tipos solido y liquido su abono es producido por el pie de cr\u00eda de sus lombrices este proceso se llama Lumbricaria consiste en comprar el pie de cr\u00eda(lombrices grandes), alimentarlas solo con desperdicios org\u00e1nicos de frutas, comida y verduras, es como las lombrices comienzan a hacer su trabajo de trasformar todo los residuos org\u00e1nicos en abono solido o en abono liquido. Estos tipos de abono se pueden aprovechar en cualquier tipo de cultivo, los beneficios es que son de buen calidad, es m\u00e1s saludable, est\u00e1 disponible a todo el p\u00fablico, pero sobretodo es org\u00e1nico a diferencia de los fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos los cuales son malos para la salud y tambi\u00e9n perjudican al medio ambiente. Do\u00f1a Do\u00f1o lleva 14 a\u00f1os con su actividad: \u201cLa inici\u00e9 porque yo vend\u00eda solo el camote del alcatraz amarillo, la vend\u00eda en macetas en los mercados pero tambi\u00e9n inicie con mi negocio por necesidad porque todos mis hijos se encontraban estudiando nuestros gastos eran demasiado de alguna manera ten\u00eda la responsabilidad de ayudar con los gastos del hogar\u201d Ahora Do\u00f1a Domitila se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de flores de varios tipos porque con estas elabora arreglos florales para cual fiesta o evento. Ha recibido  varios cursos de dise\u00f1o floral para poder obtener clientes siempre es contratada para los mejores eventos de su comunidad o de otros lugares. Sin embargo no es la \u00fanica actividad econ\u00f3mica tambi\u00e9n se dedica al cultivo de haba, jitomate, nopales, duraznos. Esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comprar rollos de pl\u00e1stico para sus invernaderos de jitomate necesita cambiar algunos  pl\u00e1sticos en malas condiciones, todos sus cultivos son producidos con el mismo abono en algunos casos el liquido o en otros el s\u00f3lido. Do\u00f1a Domi comento \u201cPara poder obtener tantos beneficios de la naturaleza debemos apreciarla  saber amarla\u201d. Ella est\u00e1 muy contenta con todos sus logros, porque adem\u00e1s de todas sus actividades tambi\u00e9n puede dar empleo a otras personas como Don Vicente y Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n quien tambi\u00e9n integran el grupo. En todas las actividades invierten los tres, las ganancias son repartidas entre ellos pero su sueldo es extra. El \u00fanico obst\u00e1culo es la falta de dinero para comprar las cosas necesarias como herramienta, pl\u00e1sticos para invernaderos, m\u00e1quinas etc. Ellos est\u00e1n muy agradecidos con KIVA y VisionFund porque de alguna manera han con tribuido para lograr el \u00e9xito obtenido en sus actividades econ\u00f3micas Do\u00f1a Teresa quien tambi\u00e9n forma parte del grupo ella tambi\u00e9n tiene una peque\u00f1a lumbricaria sin embargo esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para abastecer su tienda de abarrotes.\n","en":"The Toxiflor group is made up of four people, two women and two men. They have a nice friendship and know each other very well. The four of them are very hardworking, but above all very responsible. They have been working with VisionFund for several cycles. They all live in the same community, where most residents work as merchants. They chose the name of the group because three of them work in flower cultivation for floral arrangements.  Domitila,  or Domi,as they affectionately call her, says that she is 48 years old. She has been married to Juan for several years. They don't have any dependent children any more because they have all grown and support themselves. She only went to secondary school but she is a hardworking woman. Her responsibility is what distinguishes her. She works making organic fertilizer. There are two types, solid and liquid. Her fertilizer is produced by raising worms. The process is called lumbricaria. It consists of buying broodstock (large worms), and feeding them  only organic waste from fruit, food and vegetables. That is how the worms start to do their work of transforming the organic residuals into liquid or solid fertilizer. These types of fertilizer can be used on any type of crop. The benefits are that they are good quality, is healthier, and it is available to everyone. Above all, it is organic, different from chemical fertilizers that are unhealthy and hurt the environment. Do\u00f1o has been doing this activity for 14 years. \"I started it because I used to sell yellow lilies. I sold them in flowerpots in the markets but I also started my business out of necessity because all of my children were in school and our expenses were too much. I had the responsibility somehow to help with the household expenses.\u201d Now Domitila works growing flowers of all types because she makes floral arrangements with them for parties or events. She has taken several floral design courses in order to gain customers. She is always hired for the best events in her community or in other places. Nonetheless, this isn't her only economic activity. She also grows beans, tomatoes, nopal cactus and peaches. This time, she is asking for a loan to buy rolls of plastic for her tomato greenhouses. She needs to change some plastic that is in poor condition. All of her crops are grown with the same fertilizer, sometimes liquid and sometimes solid. Domi remarked \u201cTo be able to obtain so much benefit from nature, we have to appreciate it, and know how to love it.\u201d. She is very happy with everything she has achieved, because in addition to all of her activities, she can also provide employment to others such as Vicente and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n, who are also members of the group. All of them invest in all the activities. The profits are divided among the three of them, but her salary is extra. The only obstacle is a lack of money to buy necessary things such as tools, plastic for the greenhouses, machinery, etc. They are very grateful to Kiva and VisionFund because they have contributed to being able to achieve success in her economic activities.

El nombre del grupo lo eligieron ellas mismas porque viven muy cerca de un r\u00edo peque\u00f1o. Las personas de esa comunidad utilizan esta agua para usos multiples. Do\u00f1a Antonia es un miembro del grupo ella tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad esta casada desde hace ya 19 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Felipe quien trabaja como alba\u00f1il juntos han formado una familia cuatro ni\u00f1os dos de ellos se encuentran estudiando Do\u00f1a Antonia esta solicitando el credito para comprar m\u00e1s pollos ella los compra desde muy chicos para comprarlos a un precio mas barato los crece y engorda durante un tiempo para despu\u00e9s venderlos a sus vecinas que normalmente es cuando hacen alg\u00fan tipo de fiesta.

They belong to the same community, which is very beautiful and interesting because it has various festivals all year, and above all because they preserve their culture like their native language and very colorful dress.  They chose the name of the group themselves because they live very close to a small river.  The people in this community use water for multiple uses.  Do\u00f1a Antonia is  member of the group who is thirty-seven  She has been married to Felipe for nineteen years.  He works as a construction worker.  Together, they have formed a family with four children, two of whom are still in school.  Antonia is requesting a loan to buy more chickens.  She buys them when they are very small so she can buy them at a cheaper price.  She grows them and fattens them for awhile and later sells them to her neighbors, usually around the time when a festival occurs.  With her profits, she can buy shoes, clothing, and food for her children.  If she doesn't sell her animals, she prepares them for her family, so they can also save a little money that way.  Antonia told us, while smiling, \"This way we don't spend money and we have something nutritious.  There is nothing better than a good chicken raised at home.\"  The only inconvenience for her is when her chickens get sick and die because there aren't any profits this way.  Nevertheless, she is a very hard-working and positive woman.  She doesn't plan to stop her business because it is a very good activity since she can look after her children.  Her goal is to have a good henhouse where she can have many chickens to sell.  The members of her group are very happy and thankful for Vision Fund and Kiva because they are able to invest in their businesses.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Teresa and Elodia will be able to buy more chickens, while Do\u00f1a Luisa, Rosaura, Pilar, Tomasa, and Antonia are requesting a loan to buy more sheep.

They live in a very peaceful community where people usually grow corn as their main crop. Carlos says \u201cI really like the parade my community puts on to celebrate the 16th September, Mexico\u2019s Independence Day.  In other places they don\u2019t celebrate it with so much excitement anymore, but here we do\u201d.  The family chose the name of their group because it relates to their area of work, which is carpentry. If we take a look at the bible, it tells us how Noah saved the animals from a great flood thanks to a wooden ark.\r\n\r\nCarlos, the representative of the group, is 36 years old and has been married to Guadalupe for 13 years. They have three children, two of whom go to school. Carlos has had his own carpentry business for the last eight years, which he was able to open thanks to his dad, Candelario, who was the one who began the business. Carlos learnt how to make doors, tables, open-plan kitchens, chairs, office furniture, etc. To learn how to finish and varnish furniture he had to take some courses. \r\n\r\nThis time he is applying for a loan to purchase a drill and a router. He already has these tools, but he has had them for a long time and they need changing. The only difficulty in Carlos\u2019s business is the lack of space. He runs a store from his own house and as it is very small, he has had to take over other areas of his house in order to work properly. Carlos explains \u201cmy goal is to have a larger carpentry store so I can receive more customers and increase my income. The most important thing for me is my children. I would like to see them become successful professionals. If I could finish my foundation studies, they should be able to study a professional degree\u201d. \r\n\r\nCandelario and Hermelinda are also involved in his carpentry business.

Marcelino works in agriculture. From a young age he learnt the different necessary techniques to get a good harvest of cocoa beans. Generally, to finish off the routine tasks in his fields, he summons workers in the region to help. Being ex workmates of his, they feel at ease with the work they do, having been able to make a good living out of it previously.

In order to expand her business, she requested a loan of PKR 15,000 to buy more stock of clothes in different colors and designs for the summer season by taking into account the choices and tastes of her customers. In this way, she will be able to earn more income through her greater sales. It's her third year with Kashf Foundation and she hopes to have a good experience with this new loan.

Continued funding is pivotal for these women to obtain the financial capital needed to support and grow their businesses.  In addition, when receiving a microloan from Friendship Bridge, they also receive monthly educational lessons.\r\n\r\nThe current secretary of the Utatlan Trust Bank is Angelica. Angelica is 34 years old and married to a bricklayer assistant. Together they have four children, two of whom are currently enrolled in school. Angelica\u2019s business is selling traditional and used clothing, which she sells door to door as well as from her home. Angelica\u2019s business is doing well, thus she has decided to invest more capital into the business. \r\n\r\nAngelica successfully paid off her first loan and has now applied for a second loan. She is requesting a loan of approximately $320, which she will use to purchase additional merchandise in order to offer a greater variety of products to her customers.

Santo Domingo Xenacoj.  Seven months ago the Las Rosas de Xenacoj (Xenacoj Roses) Trust Bank was formed. This new Trust Bank consists of eight women, who are on average 33 years old. Their businesses focus on the production of typical clothing and housewares like blouses, fajas (sashes), and tablecloths.  After seven months, all of the members of the Las Rosas de Xenacoj Trust Bank have successfully repaid their first loans and have now applied for a second loan cycle.  In addition, two new members have been voted into the Trust Bank.\r\n\r\nDolores, a new member of the Las Rosas de Xenacoj Trust Bank, is 28 years old and married to a tailor.  They are a new family as they just welcomed their first daughter into the world last year.  Dolores makes fajas (sashes) in various colors and designs. She is known in the community for having beautiful designs and colors that all of her clients thoroughly enjoy. At this point, her business is doing quite well, so she approached Friendship Bridge to request her first loan of approximately US $256. She will use these funds to buy a variety of colors of thread that she will use in order to keep up with the current demand for her garments. \r\n\r\nDolores is very excited about the loan, as she has clients who regularly purchase from her.   This means steady income for her and her family. As a young family, Dolores and her husband know that husbands and wives must work to support each other in order to provide the best life for their children.  Dolores has a dream to own a storefront where she can showcase her products and gain more clients without neglecting her regular customers who continue to support her and purchase her products.  Dolores has confidence and a business plan to do this and part of the plan relies on capital from Friendship Bridge. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the women in the Las Rosas de Xenacoj Trust Bank are grateful for the support of Friendship Bridge and KIVA investors. By endowing their Trust Bank with funding the women are already supporting the development of their families and their community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1939.44,"image":{"id":1399708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy a variety of colors of thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santo Domingo Xenacoj, Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-08-04T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-03T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Piedad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Merici ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2985}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":387.89,"local_amount":3003,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3034.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813244,"comment":null},{"amount":387.89,"local_amount":3003,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3034.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089115,"comment":null},{"amount":387.88,"local_amount":3003,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3034.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855084,"comment":null},{"amount":387.89,"local_amount":3003,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3034.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503420,"comment":null},{"amount":387.89,"local_amount":3003,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3034.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728404,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-09T01:09:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591762,"name":"Ana Delmi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana de 40 a\u00f1os de edad  vive casa propia con su esposo y  sus cuatro hijos ellos estudian actualmente, ella tiene  una  tienda en la cual vende productos de primera  necesidad  como cereales, golosinas,  bebidas, aceites  entre otros , por su gran dedicaci\u00f3n ella ha logrado tener una buena clientela  a la cual ella trata de ofrecer los mejores precios y productos, con las ganancias que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, Ana est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para poder  realizar la compra de  productos por mayor como golosinas, aceite, granos b\u00e1sicos, huevos, refrescos, agua embotellada,etc. lo que le permitir\u00eda  acrecentar  y mejorar sus ganancias y de esa manera poder darle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Forty-year-old Ana lives in her own house with her husband and four children, who are currently in school.

He lives in the city of Piura, in the Jayanca district, with his three children who he loves and who are his main reason for living. He is a very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who always dedicates all his effort to getting his family ahead.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, due to a lack of financial resources and the need to work from a very young age to help his parents, Willian was unable to finish his secondary studies and that made it impossible for him to study the professional Agronomy degree that he wished to pursue.\r\n\r\nIn his free time, he likes to read the newspaper and on some occasions he cooks a delicious \"Lomo Saltado\" (A Peruvian beef, tomato, onion stir fry dish) to share with his family.\r\n\r\nWillian sells the agricultural products that he cultivates on his small parcel of land on his own initiative, and with much determination and dedication. He sells these products in the little markets of his city. He works every day beginning in the early hours of the morning and he can work for approximately 10 hours.\r\n\r\nWillian is very thankful to the Kiva lenders since, thanks to the help they offer him, he will be able to build a bathroom in his home, since his family does not currently have an adequate bathroom.

Eight women make up this Trust Bank and most of the group has traditional large families. The members of the Source of Blessing Trust Bank have joined Friendship Bridge, a microfinance and education organization in Guatemala in order to have access to working capital to support and expand their businesses.\r\n\r\nThe loans granted by Friendship Bridge benefit small micro-entrepreneurs. Teresa is one such entrepreneur, and is the secretary of The Fuente de Bendici\u00f3n Trust Bank. Teresa is a 36-year old woman who joined Friendship Bridge more than a year ago and is embarking on her third loan cycle. Currently Teresa\u2019s business is the production and sale of homemade tortillas, which she sells door-to-door. This model has allowed her to build up her client base over time. Teresa is requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to buy an industrial stove, gas, and corn, so she can produce more tortillas is less time. Teresa\u2019s business is generating income that supports all ten family members. Her dream is to expand her current business, and to possibly diversify her product offerings in the in the future to generate additional customers. \r\n\r\nIn addition to having access to capital, she also benefits from the monthly trainings she receives from her Friendship Bridge loan officer. In these monthly meetings the women receive educational programming and are encouraged to participate and have a voice on topics such as marketing, savings, sales, and reproductive health, among others.\r\n\r\nThe Fuente de Bendici\u00f3n Trust Bank is excited that people across the world want to invest in their development, as well the betterment of their families and communities. They want to ensure Kiva investors that they are very thankful and are committed to repaying the capital that they are receiving.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1194.7,"image":{"id":1399810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy an industrial stove, gas, and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quetzaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.833333 -91.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-08-04T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-03T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa Amanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoila De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Lucrecia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Floricelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":20500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1866},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1840}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":238.94,"local_amount":1866,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:20:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1869.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813245,"comment":null},{"amount":238.94,"local_amount":1866,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1869.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089117,"comment":null},{"amount":238.94,"local_amount":1866,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1869.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855086,"comment":null},{"amount":238.94,"local_amount":1866,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1869.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503422,"comment":null},{"amount":238.94,"local_amount":1866,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1869.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728406,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-31T05:01:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":589622,"name":"Progresando En Valores 1, 2 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ysabel is the coordinator of her group, Progresando en Valores 1, 2 & 3 (Progress in Values).

Currently the Trust Bank is composed of 12 women, who on average are 32 years old and have about three years of formal education. These women are very responsible, hard-working people who want to improve their lives and the lives of their children. Due to economic constraints, these women were unable to attend school, and had to work from a young age. They struggle daily to raise their young children and provide them with a better future.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a 29-year old member of Las Cruces Trust Bank who is married and has five children. Like many families in Chuanoj, Carmen and her husband are weavers. They use foot looms in order to make cortes (or traditional Guatemalan skirts), which they sell in markets nearby. \r\n\r\nBusiness is doing well and demands are high for their cortes so Carmen and her husband recently decided to hire two full-time employees. She also needs more capital to buy thread in bulk, so she is requesting a loan from Friendship Brige. This way she can keep the price low, increase production and maximize their revenues. She is currently able to fill and deliver orders within an eight-day period and is working hard to shorten the delivery time. \r\nBeyond receiving the loans, the Las Cruces Trust Bank has also created a circle of trust between its members. The women gather once a month and receive training giving by their Friendship Bridge loan officer. Through these facilitated activities, the women learn about and discuss business issues including budget management, identifying the different ways of do business (personal sales, telephone sales, wholesale sales, retail sales), and costs.

He hopes that this loan will help him increase his sales so he can improve his quality of life and help his family get ahead.\r\n\r\nCholuteca, Honduras \u2013 July 2013\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1404001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy refreshments, water, milk, sugar, beans, coffee, bread, cheeses, butter, bananas, etc., for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2013-08-04T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-03T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1274.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197091,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2548.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419960499,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1274.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840783,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-03T17:44:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591807,"name":"Marisel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora  Mar\u00edsel  es una persona muy responsable, trabajadora y   honesta,  que vive  con  su  esposo e hijos  en la zona sur de Honduras.
