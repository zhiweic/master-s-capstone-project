Silvestre decided to give back to Harlingen and the surrounding communities, he considered forming a non-profit organization but said there is normally a higher inconsistency rate as there is not enough room to direct, which hinders a successful process. \r\n\r\nKings, Queens & Scholars Magazine, which focuses on excellence in education, quickly sold out on its first day of publication in 1994, but its success ended in 1999 when Silvestre was promoted in his career as a Federal officer. \u201cWith the constant traveling, I didn't have time to dedicate to my publication,\u201d he says. Silvestre funded the magazine because he saw students and parents needed assistance and guidance during their exiting years of high school. \r\n\r\nThe original format focused on academia instead of sports, but when considering rekindling the magazine, Silvestre decided to include sports and incorporate stories written by educators, attorneys, dentists and other professionals sharing how they continued their education to obtain their jobs. Silvestre says this process helps students by reinforcing the importance of staying in school and continuing after graduation. \u201cWe\u2019re valley wide ranging from South Padre Island to Rio Grande City,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the majority of the magazine\u2019s content derives from journalism students, which gives them an opportunity to publish their work and gives Silvestre the ability to completely cover the valley. Silvestre employs a photographer, who also teaches, a design graduate who works on the design elements and his son as the publisher and computer technician. \u201cWe do a lot for the community\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re helping and guiding students, teachers, and parents with information about colleges, scholarships and the like,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s to help the community. This is our way of thanking everyone who has helped us, and giving back to the community.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about Accion Texas Inc. from The Harlingen Economic Development Corporation and the City of Harlingen, Silvestre contacted Accion for a loan. He says the loan will tremendously assist the magazine in a very positive way as he was able to purchase computers, cameras, chargers, batteries and a printer to continue production. The magazine is published bi-monthly. Silvestre expects to keep this pattern until about March 2013, when he feels he will be able to reach his goal of publishing monthly. \u201cWe\u2019re currently building our clientele,\u201d he says.

Her husband runs a taxi business. \r\n\r\nThis summer, her family built a house, but it is not finished. They need more construction material. So before the winter she is planning to reconstruct her house and to thicken the walls with materials that keep the heat as long as possible. She will use brick to thicken house walls from the outside and basalt wool from the inside. By doing this, she can cut the use of charcoal by several times compared to her current house. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 5,000,000 MNT loan. The loan Tsengelmaa is taking will be used to thicken her house walls and to repair her house.

She works every day and is very well known among the zone's inhabitants, thanks to her manner of attending to their preferences. \r\n\r\nShe wants to purchase a larger quantity of supplies and to sell more of her delicious snacks, but she lacks sufficient capital to do so. It is for this reason that she is requesting a loan through INTEGRAL, to buy corn, vegetables, meat, sugar, etc.\r\n\r\nThis young woman possesses a good credit record and can count on the satisfaction of having never done anything bad to anyone. She is grateful for the help she has been offered in the past.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1225520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn,

Constituye el centro administrativo, econ\u00f3mico y cultural de la regi\u00f3n, siendo la ciudad m\u00e1s importante del Valle Central chileno. Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n\n\n","en":"This Communal Bank is named \u201cNueva Oportunidad\u201d (New Opportunity) and consists of 15 entrepreneurs who engage in various trades such as selling clothing, managing a vending stall, selling tools, operating a bakery, weaving, providing services, and other activities.  All of the members are from the city of Talca.\r\n<p>\r\nElsa is a member of this Communal Bank group.  In the photo, she is standing in the back row in the third position from right to left.  She is wearing a coffee-colored blouse and has dark brown hair that is pulled back.  Elsa has been selling clothes and managing a bakery for five years.  She says that she works Monday through Saturday and her distribution schedule is determined by what she has available.  Elsa offers her products from her house and she has many customers.  The merchandise and supplies that she needs are purchased from supermarkets and shops that sell at low cost, which is financially convenient for her.  She will use her loan to buy butter, flour, eggs, oil, and clothing.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of Elsa\u2019s goals is to continue her businesses and buy an industrial electric oven so that she can generate more income.  This will help her achieve a better quality of life.  Elsa lives with her two children, a 14-year-old and a 10-month-old.  Her dreams for her family and for herself include owning a house so that she can provide for children\u2019s welfare.  \r\n<p>\r\nElsa is very pleased and appreciative of the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has given her.  She says that there is good communication within the organization.  With regard to the training, Elsa has learned new sales strategies and accounting techniques.  \r\n<p>\r\nTalca is in the region of Maule and is located in the central part of the country. It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of the region and is one of the most important cities in the Chilean Central Valley. One curious reference to Talca that is used in Chile is the phrase, \u201cTalca, Paris, and London\u201d. Some say that the phrase was originally attributed to an Englishman who said, \u201cTalca feels like London\u201d because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city during winter, just like in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4325,"image":{"id":1227486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy butter, flour, eggs, and oil as well as clothing to sell.

She is 46 years old and a widow.  Elmira has one 17 year-old son, who helps her with the household.  She shows herself as a calculated and smart person.  Besides this, Elmira can run her business well.  Animal husbandry is the primary source of income for the family.  Her disability pension serves as an additional source of income.  After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Elmira's family got involved in animal husbandry.  This business helped feed the family during those difficult years of perestroika.  She has been running her business for 20 years.  Elmira's starting capital amounted to 10,000 KGS.  Since that time, the family has tried to improve its living conditions and increase livestock headcount. Today, the family's monthly income amounts to 10,000-15,000 som (KGS), and the business contains three cows and two calves.  In order to further develop her business, Elmira requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock at a lower price.  Elmira's plans are to improve the family's welfare and increase livestock headcount.

She is 51 years old, a widow and raised four children.  Her oldest son left to work in the Russian Federation, two daughters are married, and the youngest daughter works in Osh.  Erkeiym obtained a secondary-specialized education and shows herself as a very conscientious and decent person.  Besides this, Erkeiym is able to organize her business at a high level.  Animal husbandry is the primary source of income for the family.  After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Erkeiym's family got involved in animal husbandry.  This business helped feed the family even during those difficult years of perestroika.  Erkeiym's starting capital amounted to practically 0 som.

is 37 years old and lives in the town of Pakwach in the Arua region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, two of whom are currently in school. <p>\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Harriet has been working hard to manage her small retail shop, where she rents out space to sell household items. To help expand her business, Harriet has requested a loan in the amount of 2,000,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan proceeds would be used to buy more household items for re-sale purposes. By increasing her inventory, Harriet expects the loan proceeds to help her generate greater profits and pay her children's education fees. In the future, Harriet hopes to be able to continue to increase inventory in her store. <p>\r\n\r\nHarriet is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

","en":"Rahima is 65 years old.  Her husband suddenly passed away.  Rahima gave birth to and raised three children.  Currently, her youngest son lives with Rahima.  Her oldest son is married and so is her daughter.  Rahima has a secondary education.  She got married after finishing school.  After the breakup of a collective farm, she got her plot of land and got involved in farming and animal husbandry.  She has been involved in business for a long time - about 20 years.  She started her business with 60,000 KGS.  Currently, the family continues to be involved in farming and animal husbandry and have one cow.  Selling milk from home is Rahima's secondary source of income.  The family's monthly income amounts to about 10,000 KGS.  Rahima is a very active and hardworking person.  Following her husband's death and being left alone with all problems, Rahima was able to live through it all, thanks to her sense of purpose and calmness.  Rahima requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.  She plans to buy three cows.  In the future, Rahima plans to increase livestock headcount and improve living conditions.  Her goal in life is to marry off her son and raise grandchildren.

She and her husband have one son.  Her husband and son help Gulmira with running the business.  Currently, she is involved in selling food products at her small store.  She started her business with 20,000 som in 1993.  Gulmira's monthly income amounts to about 15,000-20,000 som.  She is a very honest and goal-oriented person.  After the breakup of the USSR, Gulmira and her husband were left in a difficult predicament, as collective farms fell apart and widespread privatization started.  Everything that she has achieved was achieved thanks to her love of hard work.  In order to further expand her business, she requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase food products for subsequent resale.  Gulmira plans to use the resulting income to improve her living conditions.  She said that her plans are to increase product turnover and repair her apartment in the future.

She is married to Roldan, a publicator, and is the mother of three children. She, together with her husband and children, manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEvangeline operates a food processing business. She has a factory a few steps from her house where they manufacture the meat products. She earns by selling her goods to her neighbors and to suppliers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional processed and frozen meat products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEvangeline hopes to be able to expand soon, as she dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Miguel is from the area of Jicaral, a place in the northern region of the country.  Miguel \u00c1ngel butchers beef and pork and sells cattle for a living.  His business consists of going around the neighboring areas, and he rides there and back on horseback.  He travels up to 6 kilometers to buy cattle and pigs and then sells these to his customers, both through standing orders and new business.  He has spent the past 9 years in this line of work.\r\n\r\nMiguel has worked previously with Fundaci\u00f3n and has proven himself to be a timely and responsible person in regards to his loan payments.  He is currently seeking a loan for investment in his working capital so that he can buy a lot of pigs and horses that are currently offered at a good price, as he wants to take advantage of this opportunity to make a better profit and satisfy his customers' needs.  Miguel gratefully acknowledges the assistance that the Kiva investors provide for people with scant economic resources and poor countries such as Nicaragua to have a decent working environment. Especially in a country with such lack of permanent jobs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":965672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to invest in his working capital for buying and selling pigs and cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2012-10-30T22:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-29T22:10:07Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.61,"local_amount":1500.53,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1544.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322992716,"comment":null},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":1391.09,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1431.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331972457,"comment":null},{"amount":61.91,"local_amount":1437.83,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-21T08:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1479.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347758019,"comment":null},{"amount":140.32,"local_amount":3259.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3354.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356526861,"comment":null},{"amount":64.24,"local_amount":1491.95,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364568073,"comment":null},{"amount":66.01,"local_amount":1533.03,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1577.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373162701,"comment":null},{"amount":64.69,"local_amount":1502.44,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1546.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381968502,"comment":null},{"amount":253.33,"local_amount":5884.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6056.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390830318,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-12T16:26:31Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:28:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":490533,"name":"Luzminda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of seven children, Luzminda works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business buying and selling rice in the Philippines, and she earns additional income from fish vending.

They are from a community called Las Limas whose residents work growing sugarcane and collecting sap from rubber trees.\r\n\r\nMaricela relates that she works making knitted crafts like blouses, shoes, mats, dresses, shawls and baby clothes and embroidered napkins.  She does her work on order and since she\u2019s been doing it for several years she doesn\u2019t have to leave her house to sell because customers come to her to place their orders.  She said that she learned to make crafts because her parents were unable to pay for more schooling for her so she learned an occupation that would help her get ahead in the future.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy thread, knitting needles, needles, fabric, soles and ribbons to continue making her crafts.  She wants to use her profits to buy more materials to continue in her activity and gradually make home improvements.  \r\n\r\nThe group sends a message of appreciation to people who will help them make their loan possible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1227711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy thread, needles, knitting needle and fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Limas, Tezonapa; Veracruz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-30T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-29T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zuleyma Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernardita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2125.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392202,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4251.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120088,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4251.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068134,"comment":null},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":6375,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6376.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284872,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-31T00:44:18Z","paid_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":490540,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Marilou works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has an ambulatory business vending dried fish in the Philippines, and she earns additional income by growing sugarcane.

She is originally from a place full of the rich history of Mexico. Also very close to there is the sanctuary of the monarch butterflies, where year after year the butterflies arrive from Canada, producing an unequaled spectacle.  Her area presents itself as one of the principal tourist attractions of Mexico, offering beautiful natural landscapes, where a typical provincial atmosphere can be experienced, where traditions and customs are preserved, and where there is a great variety of gastronomy to delight the most demanding palate. Lupita, as her friends call her, is part of the group called \"Poetas\" (Poets).\n\nShe has had a sandwich business for a little more than a year, and she says that she embarked on this business to be able to contribute something to her household and so that it would not be so difficult for her husband to support their son in his education, since he is in secondary school and the expenses are very substantial. She also says that she set up the business to have a productive activity where she would feel useful, and this is why she set up her sandwich shop. She is applying to Vision Fund for a loan to buy the ingredients that she needs in her business, such as rolls, mayonnaise, cream, vegetables such as avocados, onions, tomatoes, and peppers in vinegar, and some soda. She says that if she receives the loan, her business will improve and thus she will be able to have more sales, and this makes her very happy, since she wants to improve to thus be able to give her son a better quality of life. Lupita's goal is to set up her own location, since the place where she sells now is rented, and they charge her something dear for the rent. For this reason, she wants her own place. \n\nThe other 12 members of the group are Guadalupe, Rodrigo, Irma, Ricarda, Teresa, Eduardo, Beatriz, Elizabeth, Maria Alejandra, Pablo, Janet, and Roberto. They will invest their loans in beauty products, car parts, fur production, catalog beauty products, sweets and seeds to sell, seasonal fruits and vegetables to sell, catalog clothing and shoes to sell, etc.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5775,"image":{"id":1207912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients to make sandwiches, such as rolls, mayonnaise, cream, vegetables such as avocados, onions, tomatoes, and chiles in vinegar, and some soft drinks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-31T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-30T01:00:04Z","loan_amount":5775,"lender_count":183,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodrigo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4687.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3248.44,"local_amount":42187.5,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":42290.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120065,"comment":null},{"amount":1804.69,"local_amount":23437.5,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":23494.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068112,"comment":null},{"amount":721.87,"local_amount":9375,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":9397.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284849,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T06:18:50Z","paid_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":490335,"name":"Union Y Amistad Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marisol tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada con Jos\u00e9 el cual trabaja en la industria de la construcci\u00f3n en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico y tienen 2 ni\u00f1os;

He works in the construction industry in Mexico City. \r\n\r\nShe is part of the group Union y Amistad [Unity and Friendship] and says that they chose this name for their group because they are very united, and when someone can't make their payment, they help each other to be able to get the payment and not lose face. \r\n\r\nFor more than four years she has been selling baby clothing and women's underwear, as well as stockings and women's socks. She says that this business took root when she saw that the women who come to her mother-in-law, who is a midwife, for an emergency consultation for help giving birth, they didn't come prepared with clothing for the baby or for themselves. They weren't ready. So it occurred to her to start selling baby clothing like small blankets, diapers, pants, bibs, baby outfits, rompers, and socks, and women's panties, pants, jackets, shoes and sanitary napkins that are used when they're going to give birth. She says that she likes her job a lot, because this way she can be devoted to her small children. \r\n\r\nShe stocks up on clothing in the cities of Toluca and Mexico in different stores where they give her lower prices, so she makes a better profit. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan from Visi\u00f3n Fund in order to grow her business a little more, and already even neighbors from her community come and buy socks for their children's school from her. Marisol says, \"I like what I sell because this way I can contribute something and I can buy what I want for my children, and help my husband with the bills. Also I'm happy to belong to this group and already I have done several cycles; they always treat us very well and have the lowest interest rates.\" \r\n\r\nThe other six members of the group are Lidia, Ofelia, Fabi\u00e1n, Gilberta, Sandra and Juan Carlos. They will invest in goods for different purposes: to sell in a school store; in the purchase of surgical material and medicine for sale; for the purchase of feed and lambs; for the purchase of fertilizer and peach and avocado plants to grow; and for the purchase of seasonal fruits and vegetables to sell.

The livestock market is only operated once a week. With the limited capital that he has, Miklon is only able to sell 1 pig or goat from a local farmer and resell it at the livestock market.\r\n\r\nMiklon would like to sell more livestock and therefore requested a loan of IDR 5,000,000 from TLM.

She is married to Santiago, a heavy equipment operator, and is a mother. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMa. Leonora oversees operations of their jeepney transportation business (please see footnote). She has a one unit jeepney (14-16 person capacity), which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1000 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMa. Leonora dreams to expand her business and hopes to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n- Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

He continues to grow corn and beans while his wife manages the convenience store.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 6,000 HNL that he is requesting from ODEF, Ra\u00fal wants to grow his business by restocking it with more products.  He plans to buy basic grains, salt, coffee, soap, detergent, eggs, shortening, sugar, soft drinks, snacks, condiments, medicines, and other products.  His goal is to build an adjoining room to his house so that he can relocate his business, which is currently set up in his living room.  This will enable him to provide better service to his customers.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1228160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy basic grains, salt, coffee, soap, detergent, eggs, shortening, sugar, soft drinks, snacks, condiments, medicines, and other products.

from Sierra Leone! This is 35-year-old Musu from Moriba town, Bo Southern area. She is married and has 4 children between the ages of 8 and 18. Her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nMusu runs a general stock business at her house; she sells cloth, ice cubes, suitcases and soft drinks. She has been running this business for 10 years. She works at the business from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., 7 days per week, and has two relatives that help her sell the ice cubes and soft drinks. Her business is the only source of income she has. Musu says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and the electrical power she needs to cool her drinks and ice cubes.  \r\n\r\nMusu has requested a loan in order to purchase a larger variety of stock, like suitcases and clothing material. The extra income from this loan will allow her to sell more clothes. In the future, she plans to expand her business more. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1227390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

30-year-old Isatu from Moriba town, Bo Southern area in Sierra Leone. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 1 and 8.  One of her children is currently attending school. In 2003, Isatu established her shop selling clothes and perfumes. She began her business because she wants her family's life to improve. She works at the business every day, 13 hours per day. At present, she is faced with insufficient capital to expand her business.  She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation costs and competition in the market. \r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to buy similar items such as blouses, jeans, and perfumes to add to her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to start a savings account and increase her business. In the future, Isatu plans to expand her business and employ staff. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1227397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

from Sierra Leone! This is 23-year-old Kadiatu from Moriba town, Bo, Southern area. She is a married mother of one child age 4 years. She began her business because she did not go to school, and her husband's income is not enough to support the home.\r\n\r\nKadiatu runs a local products business; she sells palm oil, native rice and pepper. She has been running this business for three years. She works at the business every day, 12 hours per day. Her other source of income comes from a small-scale business. Kadiatu says that the main challenges to her business are insufficient capital to invest in her business and an improper business location.\r\n\r\nKadiatu has requested a loan in order to purchase more palm oil and native rice. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her status. In the future, she plans to expand her business to a shop level. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1227418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is a Mexican artisan who specializes in ceramic sculptures. He would like to buy raw materials such as clay, wire and paint. He has been selling through NOVICA since 2009. This is his story: \r\n\r\n\"I stepped into the world of ceramic arts when I was 12 years old. Back then, my family's economic situation was difficult, so after school, my brother David and I would learn this craft and get paid a small amount. However, we were immediately taken by the artistry and its techniques. There was a teacher from school who was also going through some financial difficulties, so he set up a little workshop in his house and that extra money helped him put his own children through school. Then I went to Juana Velazquez' workshop and that's when I really began to learn the art of ceramics. I stayed at this workshop for 12 years, but a year before I left this great artisan died of cancer. She was like family to us, and we stood by her husband during this difficult time. I started my own workshop when I was 27 years old, and here is where I practice all I learned, always enjoying the beauty of Mexican ceramic artistry.

is a Peruvian artisan who makes handcrafted jewelry.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I began helping out in a jewelry workshop when I was 15, during school vacations. Little by little, this activity became a passion. I realized how much I enjoyed working with meticulous details, and eventually found a great deal of satisfaction in creating jewelry that people liked. Beauty can be expressed in different forms and manners. The challenge for a country like Peru is to get ahead little by little, despite the many difficult circumstances that exist. It's important that people appreciate the art of jewelry, as many don't value the effort it requires.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful for your support as I create my jewelry designs. This has been my passion since I was a young man, and it has brought me great satisfaction. It's wonderful to see how the simplest design becomes beautiful when worn by a woman.

interest in ethnic cultures was first seeded by her African heritage. Her interest in various ethnic cultures and ethnic products further developed when she began to experience more and more various types of cultures while coordinating and participating in swap meets and yard sales.   \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Candace was put on work disability, and in order to supplement her income, she decided to combine her passion for retail and culture by opening Ethnicity\u2019s Unique Boutique.  \r\n\r\nHer home-based business began to grow and she tapped into business educational resources through the Entrepreneur Academy at the Southeastern Economic Development Corporation (SEDC).  Through the SEDC, Candace learned about Accion\u2019s microloan program and was able to secure a loan to purchase a computer and additional inventory.   Since then, Candace has repaid her first Accion loan and has expanded her business into a retail storefront in San Diego.  \r\n\r\nCandace would like to further expand her business by attracting new customers through a storefront improvement process and marketing campaigns. Candace will use her $10,000 Kiva loan to make much needed storefront improvements, design new marketing materials and build a website.   \r\n\r\nShe hopes that these improvements will allow her to continue to enhance her community\u2019s rich cultural diversity through the unique ethnic art, home d\u00e9cor and accessories she offers at her store. \r\n\r\nCheck out her Facebook page at:

She is married to Rommel and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMary Grace operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Grace hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1227598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-31T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-30T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4513.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960274,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2579.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094986,"comment":null},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484137,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2579.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036660,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2579.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781274,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T02:05:12Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T11:34:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":490882,"name":"Lilibeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilibeth is 42 years old, married, and has four children.\r\n\r\nLilibeth works hard to provide for her family.

is Nelmalita, 51, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Santos, a driver, and is a mother to her children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNelmalita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, it is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNelmalita dreams of having a good life through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1108016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She is married to Candelario and mother to her children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElsa is a mineral water distributor. She buys mineral water in containers from wholesalers and then sells the containers (5 gallons per container) at a profit. Her regular customers for her mineral water are her neighbors and the local community.  She has a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more stocks of mineral water to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElsa dreams of being able to give her all her children a high-quality education and hopes to have her own vehicle through all her hard work with her business. She also hopes to have a growing network of customers. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that they study.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance
