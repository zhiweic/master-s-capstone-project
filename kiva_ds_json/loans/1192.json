The family owns a horse which is used in wood transportation from the forest. Nino\u2019s son sells the wood to locals during winter. But the existing income is modest and not enough for covering everyday costs. That\u2019s why Nino decided to start up a trading business with a loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Nino\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she didn\u2019t satisfied their requirements. She received this credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so-called Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With this loan of 800 GEL she will purchase household items: blankets, bed-clothing, vessels, etc at wholesale prices and sell them in her community. Her regular customers will be her co-workers and neighbors. It is obvious that the job is hard for Nino, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her business gradually.

Thus, all family members help each other with daily tasks. Reyna has been a farmer for many years, since it was her parents who, in keeping with family tradition, taught her to till the land. Reyna's speciality is coffee crops, to which she has been tending for over 10 years with her husband's help and which constitute her family's sole source of income. The land they use belongs to them, half thanks to a legacy made by her father, and half bought by the sweat of their brow. The couple embarked on this productive development activity, which provides their daily bread, out of a need to improve their income and thus their children's standard of living. Reyna asked field partner COMIXMUL for a loan in order to buy 12 quintals of fertiliser, 12 quintals of urea, and 10 quintales of coffee-plant growing mixture, which will enable her to tend to her coffee crops and profit from the expected plentiful harvest.

He lives in a common-law marriage with his partner. From a young age, he learned about farm work from his father. He currently lives on a rented plot of land where he grows potatoes, beans, and peas. He harvests the crops and sells them in the marketplace in his municipality.

He is then able to cover his household necessities and bring home the daily bread to his family.\r\n\r\nJohn is a fighter and a strong, hardworking man. Despite the adversities and obstacles that come up, he always finds a way to face them and continue moving forward. His greatest challenge is paying for the supplies he needs to take care of his crops, because they are quite expensive. He has also had some problems because the price of his harvest is variable and unstable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he has applied for a loan to invest in the purchase of farm supplies such as manure, fungicides, fertilizer, and seeds to continue with his business, which has become his main source of income. He will then be able to produce a better-quality harvest and sell his crops at a higher price in the marketplace, increasing his profit margin. This will help him to accomplish his dream of expanding his crops in the medium term and having favorable financial stability, which will allow him to give his children an excellent education and enjoy a better quality of life with his

has always dreamt of becoming a professional. To achieve his goal, Sandro has enrolled in the Universidad San Fransisco Xavier. He plans on graduating in March, 2014 but without a loan from Vittana he thinks that he may need to take time off to work and save until he can return to school. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Sandro plans on purchasing his much needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Sandro feels he will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. In addition to his responsibilities at school, Sandro currently works 30 hours a week and earns $20 a day. With a degree in business he expects to earn $25 a day. \r\n\r\nSandro's parents were never able to complete their primary education. For his family of seven, finances have always been tight.

He was born and raised in the countryside, where he learned about farm work from his father. However, he was displaced 35 years ago due to violence. Along with his wife and children, he left his native town, leaving behind everything they had worked so hard to achieve.\r\n\r\nThey settled down in another town, Antioquia, where they arrived in search of new opportunities to start over. After difficult work on various farms, he managed to get his own home, where he has 40 avocado trees and crops of corn and arracacha (a root vegetable). The harvests are sold in the town marketplace. With this work, he earns enough to cover his family's needs. Jes\u00fas says that his age does not prevent him from doing what he likes. He is constantly active and taking care of his crops, because this is his source of income. During some seasons, he has the support of a daily laborer. \r\n\r\nHe has applied for a loan to continue caring for his crops.

Hace un tiempo regres\u00f3 al pa\u00eds y con algunos ahorros pudo comprar su casa propia en un primer piso, con el objetivo de montar otro negocio que le ayudara a solventar las necesidades de su hogar. En el mes de Mayo de 2012 mont\u00f3 una tienda de abarrotes, aprovechando la ventaja de que el sector donde reside se encuentra en crecimiento urban\u00edstico, por lo que hasta el momento le ha dado buenos resultados, adem\u00e1s cuenta con el apoyo de su esposa para el manejo de \u00e9ste.

He has been working independently since he was 24 years old.  With his brother\u2019s support he established a bakery and gained knowledge about this work, thanks to the baker with whom he used to work.  This business lasted for ten years.  Then he had the opportunity to relocate abroad for some years.\r\n\r\nSome time ago he returned to the country, and with some savings he was able to buy his own house on the first floor.  His objective for doing so was to establish another business, which would help him pay for the household necessities.  \r\n\r\nIn May of 2012 he opened a grocery story.  He was taking advantage of the fact that the area where he lives is showing urban growth.  So far it has given him good results.  His wife helps him manage it.  Hildebrando is an enterprising, vigorous, and responsible man who devotes himself to his family and his work.\r\n\r\nHe is always looking for new options to help him get ahead, and he has found support through various loans that he has received in the past.  He is now requesting his sixth loan cycle.  He will do this in order to buy fixed goods (display case) and to buy stock (hygiene products, cold meats, dairy products, pastries, cookies, and other basic needs products) wholesale.  This will give his business a better image, it will attract more customers, and he will have a greater quantity of inventory available to satisfy the needs and preferences of all of his customers.  That will be reflected in the increase in sales and revenue.\r\n\r\nHildebrando dreams of making his business grow and become a supermarket in which he will be able to offer employment opportunities.  This will generate enough resources to provide his children with an excellent university education so that they will have a promising and successful future.  He will also be able to enjoy a better quality of life alongside his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249.33,"image":{"id":1412955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a display case and stock for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-19T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-18T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hildebrando De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90044},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92509},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95041},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97643},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100317},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":103063},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":105884},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":108783},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":111761},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":114821},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":117965},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121194},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":124512},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":127921},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":131423},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":135021},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":138717},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":142515},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":146417},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150425},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":154543},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":158774},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163121},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167586}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.89},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.81,"local_amount":182500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":183145.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807393,"comment":null},{"amount":49.72,"local_amount":94700,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":95035,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095483,"comment":null},{"amount":51.26,"local_amount":97640,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":97985.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074543,"comment":null},{"amount":52.54,"local_amount":100070,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009736,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T13:54:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":594936,"name":"Comfort","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Comfort is married with two children.

After earning his masters degree in music education, he began offering music lessons to students in his local Brooklyn community. Owen discovered that he not only enjoyed teaching music, but enjoyed teaching in general.  In addition to offering music lessons, he took a job teaching math and English to elementary and middle school students. \r\n\r\nAfter years of gaining experience teaching, Owen decided to open his own home-based business, Roken-4-Life Tutoring Agency, in January 2013.

When Ivan and his wife moved from Venezuela to Deerfield Beach, FL eight years ago, the couple began the Traditional Karate Center of Florida, an academy designed to not only teach Karate skills but also to inspire children to live a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIvan offers Karate lessons for kids and adults as well as bodyguard training, while his wife runs an afterschool program to help the working parents within the community. The afterschool program currently has a waiting list of 45 students. Ivan and his wife are looking to remodel their studio space to better accommodate their many classes and large enrollments. This loan will allow them to paint, remodel the floor, and fix the door to create a safer and more comfortable space for their community.\r\n\r\nTo read more about Ivan\u2019s Karate Center, visit: http:\/\/www.tkcof.com."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":689.76,"image":{"id":1409228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"to remodel the Karate studio by replacing the floor and the door and purchasing paint for the interior.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Florida","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2013-08-19T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-18T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2694.45,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":133.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":138.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":139.03},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":141.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":142.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":144.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":148.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":148.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":150.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":151.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":154.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":155.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":157.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":160.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":161.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":164.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":165.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134.11,"local_amount":133.83,"processed_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":134.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399723038,"comment":null},{"amount":135.81,"local_amount":135.54,"processed_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":135.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409992069,"comment":null},{"amount":138.55,"local_amount":138.26,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-28T09:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":138.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419756795,"comment":null},{"amount":139.32,"local_amount":139.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":139.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429406898,"comment":null},{"amount":141.97,"local_amount":141.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T09:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":141.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439625027,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-24T00:51:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597024,"name":"Luciano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Luciano, esta en pareja,  tiene 3 hijos en edad escolar.

However, when possible he sends money to Marifat. Marifat's second son works in an in-store bakery. \r\n\r\nMarifat turned to MDO Arvand in order to get a loan for repairing the roof of her house. For several years the slate has deteriorated, and after heavy rain the roof started leaking.

Little by little, she has been investing money in her business to make it grow. Her last acquisition was a coverstitch sewing machine, which occupies a lot of space and, due to this, her workshop is very tight. For this reason, she requests the support of a loan, since she hopes to make some adaptations to her workshop by demolishing a wall and installing a large window. Her goal is to use natural light to its full potential and be able to work comfortably. This will result in a shorter production time and will allow her to return the pending orders in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nJulia dreams of her business surviving for a long time but, in the mean time, she would like to implement the production of her own line of lingerie, sportswear, and home goods.

primary source of income for rural residents.  Many people, like Sobirjon, are involved in farming and earn an income for living.  Sobirjon has been involved in growing agricultural crops, such as potatoes, wheat, etc., for over 15 years.  He has a quite good experience and develops his business year-after-year.  Sobirjon is married and has two children.  The children still do not have a regular source of income.  Sobirjon is the primary provider for the family.  Farming, particularly growing potatoes, carrots, wheat, is not only a source of income for him, but also a favorite occupation.  He works with satisfaction on the field from early morning until late evening.  He values every piece of his land and says to himself, \"land-provider, thank you!\"  He plans to develop his business, but does not have money to buy seeds and mineral fertilizers.

She has only two years of primary school, but she fights every day, side-by-side with her partner, in order to give her children a better life than hers. She aims to support them in all she cans so that they want for nothing. Debora's speciality is coffee crops, having been a farmer for many years. She is very experienced with many crops, among them coffee, sweetcorn, and broad beans. The land the couple tills belongs to them, and was bought by the sweat of their brow, after saving and making sacrifices for many years. They wanted to own the land, as renting it would have offered next to no hope of carving out a better life for their family. Their house is located on this property, since they are the only ones who work at the farm. Debora's dream is her goal of giving her children a good education, which she thinks of as the key to a better future and to success in life. She fights day after day for this goal and thus asked field partner COMIXMUL for a loan in order to buy coffee-plant fertiliser, coffee-plant growing mixture, 18-46-0 fertiliser, and urea, which will enable her to tend to her coffee crops and profit from the expected plentiful harvest, since her business is her family's only source of income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1412196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy the supplies she needs to tend to her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-20T09:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-19T09:50:01Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T14:13:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":595222,"name":"Tamam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tamam is a 44-year-old married mother of five children.

Today she has a business in which she sells vegetables, something that she learned to do in her youth and has been working at it for more than 30 years.\r\n\r\nThe loan for which she is now applying will be used to increase capital (to buy vegetables) that she will purchase from sellers in the city of El Alto, and will then sell in her sales space. This line of work allows her to generate resources for her family since she is divorced and has four children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she liked about Pro Mujer, she responded that she liked the health area.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2317.56,"image":{"id":1413880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-08-20T11:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-19T11:50:01Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cyntia Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milenka\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Senddy Mariza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26076,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1201.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2030.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2057.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2086.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2114.62},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2143.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2172.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2201.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2232.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2262.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2292.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3279.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":302.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":314.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":474.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":467.94,"local_amount":3232.32,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3233.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197910,"comment":null},{"amount":599.92,"local_amount":4143.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4145.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153657,"comment":null},{"amount":616.42,"local_amount":4257.94,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4259.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615230,"comment":null},{"amount":633.28,"local_amount":4374.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4375.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736169,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-12T22:32:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597483,"name":"Juana Socorrro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al lado de su pareja con quien 4 hijos a los cuales ama much\u00edsimo y son su raz\u00f3n de vivir.

Her life partner works as a day labourer at a farm, milking cows twice a day. Their two children live with them and their son who is 19 works with his father as a day labourer. When he finished his basic education it was very difficult for him to carry on studying because the secondary schools are a long way away. He would have to travel to the city every day and the transport is irregular, with only one bus a day from the place where they live. Their younger daughter is studying in fourth grade at the community school which is 2 blocks from their house.\r\n\r\nNorma's current work is looking after an elderly lady in the city every other night from 5pm to 6am. She has been doing this type of work or working as a domestic help in the city for several years. She has to travel 10km to work and the transport is irregular with only one bus a day passing through the community and if they are not on time they have to travel by \"pick-up\".\r\n\r\nPreviously Norma worked at home on small business activities with her mum. They used to make chicken tamales to sell in their community and also worked in agriculture and looking after farm animals (pigs, chickens and cattle) at their home. When the family's expenses became greater, Norma had to look for other forms of income and through references from friends and family she was able to find work as a domestic help in the city.\r\n\r\nNorma will use the loan to buy building materials to begin building her house, since the family are currently living in a house of her mother's. She used a first loan she was given to buy bricks for the walls, but now they want to start building their own house on a piece of land which her mother left her.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to finish the house one day so they can live more comfortably and to have farmyard animals without affecting anyone else. She wants her children to be more comfortable in a bigger and more secure place, and will support her daughter if wants to continue to intermediate school once she finishes her basic education in the community. The idea is to keep making progress bit by bit. The money which her life partner and her son earn covers the family's living expenses and the income Norma gets pays for the loan instalments. If necessary she will take out another loan to finish building the house.\r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":341.59,"image":{"id":1413894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy building materials, to start building her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-20T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-19T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":58.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":61.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":60.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":64.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":66.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":69.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":70.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":72.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":74.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":80.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.61},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":73.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":73.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815023,"comment":null},{"amount":72.18,"local_amount":72.18,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:42Z","rounded_local_amount":72.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090866,"comment":null},{"amount":64.94,"local_amount":64.94,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":64.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856862,"comment":null},{"amount":63.04,"local_amount":63.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":63.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505132,"comment":null},{"amount":68.09,"local_amount":68.09,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":68.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716211,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T19:57:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597490,"name":"Bella Vista Pucarani Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cBELLA VISTA PUCARANI\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Copacabana, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Eulalia es la Presidenta.

is 46 years old, single and lives with his retired parents in the village of Norio. Zaza is unemployed at the moment. There is high unemployment rate in the region and Zaza was unable to find a suitable job.\r\nThe only source for the family is the retirement pension of Zaza\u2019s parents, which is hardly enough for food and every day expenses. That is why he decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial condition and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Zaza applied for a loan from MFO Credo. His request was approved within the framework of their Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses.

After growing up in the village, she took a risk on factory life in Bangkok, traveling hundreds of miles from her family and community. Although she found work in a shoe factory, she found city life too harsh and dangerous. Many rural people are faced with a similar quandary\u2014while the city boasts economic opportunity, poor laborers are vulnerable to exploitation and live in dangerous conditions. \n\nBanyen returned to her village and turned to agricultural labor (along with her husband). They worked long hours using dangerous pesticides in an attempt to build a stable life, but could not achieve the security they longed for.  For Banyen and laborers like her, the biggest struggle can be financing- a typical personal loan requires collateral and exorbitant interest. \n\nThe constant strain of farming led her to begin looking for a more reliable source of income. Banyen discovered the opportunity to weave hammocks and leapt at the chance to be trained and earn a supplementary income for her growing family. \n\nHer oldest daughter is enrolled at a government boarding school. Although tuition is free, there are many related costs. Hammock weaving is a lifeline for their family to reach a stable middle-class lifestyle. With her weaving income, she can earn as much as she would at a full-time job in the city, without losing her community (and the low cost of living in Huay Oi). Most important of all, weaving income is opening new opportunities for her children. \n\nThis loan will not only give her the income security she needs but also a chance to move ahead even further with her earning potential. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1413846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy weaving materials so she can secure consistent hammock work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2013-08-20T14:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-19T14:50:17Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Banyen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"THB","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T16:06:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597464,"name":"Dokor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dokor was born and raised in Huay Oi  (\u201cSugar Cane Creek\u201d) Village in rural Northern Thailand. She and her family live in a 200-year-old settlement near the original Yellow Leaf weaving village.  Unlike the first Yellow Leaf weavers, Dokor is not a member of a hill tribe- ethnically, she is Thai. However, life in their remote community has been marked by many of the same troubles that hill tribes have faced: marginalization, limited education and limited opportunity. \n\nWithout other options available to her, Dokor spent most of her working years as a subsistence farmer alongside her husband, living from harvest to harvest. Her village traded salt, chili peppers and other food with the Mlabri Tribe, which is how she first learned about the growing opportunity brought by weaving hammocks.\n\nThrough practice and determination, Dokor has become one of the fastest and most talented weavers in the community. With her talent and improved income, she became a role model for her neighbors, who were inspired to become weavers by her example. Now Dokor is also a highly-sought weaving instructor. She volunteers to train new weavers, spreading the life-changing opportunity to other women in the community. \n\nDokor is able to support her children\u2019s education through secondary school\u2014and even put her oldest daughter through university with money earned from weaving (a revolutionary step to assure her future!). This year she has taken a bold step in committing to full-time hammock weaving and training, leaving the fields behind for good. With job security and a loan she will be able to secure her family\u2019s future and get even further ahead in life.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1413849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy weaving materials so she can secure consistent hammock work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2013-08-20T14:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-19T14:50:17Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dokor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"THB","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T16:11:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
