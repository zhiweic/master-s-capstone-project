When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Eunice replied, 'Family income will increase'.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Eunice owns a cow and poultry but does not own a pig, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, electricity and TV but does not have solar power, running water, a sewing machine, or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

She has done this activity for more than 10 years, since when she was young her parents taught her to work in farming, an activity they still do today. She has one year of primary education but was unable to keep going to school because her parents' income was very low. Right now, she and her husband mutually support each other to get ahead, something their only child depends on. The coffee crop is 200 meters from their house and so she walks to get there. \r\n\r\nAda Argentina is asking for help to buy fertilizer, manure, and fumigation pumps to maintain her coffee crop.

She lives in the Khashuri District with husband Badri and their 2 sons. Madona requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected because of their low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 0.3 acres of agricultural lands, where maize and haricot are grown. They sell the harvested products locally. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\nMadona requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, which do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Madona will buy a milk cow. After purchasing a milk cow, Madona plans to produce dairy products to sell. This will increase the income of the family.

Cayo started studying to become a teacher, but due to lack of financial support and needing to work, Cayo could not finish his studies, although he would still like to. In his free time, he likes to read a little and sometimes cooks a delicious Cuy Chactado (fried guinea pig) for his family.\r\n\r\nCayo works hard running his convenience store -  a business that he started alone.

He lives with his wife and children in his own home in the Massablacoura district of Bougouni. Mr. Yaya has a degree in building design. Before graduating, he learned woodworking from his father. Thus, to support himself while helping out his father to cover family expenses, he decided to open a carpentry shop and sell lumber. With nine years of experience, he has a mastery of his work.\r\n\r\nTo obtain substantial working capital, he decide to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to purchase 70 boards and 30 pieces of plywood. He gets his supplies in Manankoro, Sikasso, and Bougouni. Sales are made at his workshop. His customer base is composed essentially of furniture makers and masons. He is much in demand by his customers.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 francs CFA enabling him to improve his enterprise and to pay off the loan. His ambition is to equip himself soon with a power planer (since he spends over 100,000 francs per month in planing costs).   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1301490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"to purchase lumber to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T17:00:05Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaya ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":254894.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636503,"comment":null},{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":254894.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819494,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-27T15:09:18Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531901,"name":"Jose Noel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or se dedica a la actividad de taller de motores estacionarios desde hace 28 a\u00f1os, es casado tiene 4 hijos todos en edad escolar por los que trabaja fuertement de lunes a sabado desde las  cinco de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las ocho de la noche para brindarle educacion, y mejoras en el hogar.\nel se\u00f1or comenzo su negocio como trabajaor de aviacion en reparaciones de aviones y posteriormente decidio ahorrar para poner su propio negocio, el se\u00f1or tiene a\u00f1os de trabaja con la instituci\u00f3n  y con estos financiamientos ha mejorado su negocio mantiene bastantes respuestos los cuales para el no puede dejar de mantener en su negocio ya que para el satisface a sus clientes ya que si el cliente nesecita algun respuesto el se los ofrece si nesecidad de que sus clientes anden de un lado a otro buscandolos.","en":"Jose Noel has a shop where he has been working on stationary engines for the past 28 years.

The thoughts then lead him to apply to TLM for a loan of around 10,000,000 IDR. This loan will help him to add more agricultural products and also kiosk stock such as snacks, instant noodles, eggs, shampoo, bath soap, mosquito coils, candies etc. He is hoping that the loan assistance provided by TLM could help him to provide a better life for his family.

He hopes that in the future he can expand his working zone and open a wide showroom."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1197,"image":{"id":1301194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy necessary business needs such as staples, nails, cloths, sponge, wood and tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Tyre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hassan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":138}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735995,"comment":null},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364441386,"comment":null},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846615,"comment":null},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614845,"comment":null},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390472346,"comment":null},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728440,"comment":null},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997371,"comment":null},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419761979,"comment":null},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429412071,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-01T22:38:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531504,"name":"Lentitiyio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lentitiyio is 38 years old, married to Naipartuni and blessed with five children that he supports.

Biira is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fortportal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Biira has been working hard to manage her business, which deals in firewood. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Biira has requested a loan of 400000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to start another business, and also buy more firewood to sell. It will help Biira to generate greater profits and lead to increased returns so she can start another business. Biira hopes that in the future she will be able to buy land. \r\n\r\nBiira is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is a very upbeat young woman. She is unreservedly optimistic and friendly. Her neighbors describe her as thoughtful and hard-working. As a main source of income for her family, Aida started raising livestock.

Her husband works as a labourer in a factory situated near her village. She runs a grocery shop to help her husband financially. She sells betel, rice, grains, lentils, edible oil, spices, biscuits, soap, detergent, hair oil, etc. in her shop. She has developed a very good relationship with her customers in the village. She likes the fact that she can cater to the needs of the people in her village. She has a plan to make her shop bigger and keep multiple things in her shop to satisfy her customers. She also wants to purchase the items for her shop in bulk directly from the wholesalers, for which reason she has requested a loan to utilize it in purchasing items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, soft drinks, wheat flour, grains and other household consumables."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1301180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for purchasing betel, rice, grains, lentils, edible oil, spices, biscuits, soap, detergent, hair oil, etc. for her grocery shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Balipatna, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Swagatika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anusaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bebina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binodini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kausalya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":165000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":165000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-02T11:16:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531568,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":416.25,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock for resale","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":416.25,"local_amount":35052.98,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36483.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429537432,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T03:49:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531570,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty is 36 years old and lives in Montserrado County, the capital city of Liberia, which is well known as the commercial city of Liberia.

is a 54-year-old man. He lives with his family in Khashuri district. His wife is 49 years old, and they have two children who are going to school. Vazha owns an apartment which he is renting out so the family has a small monthly income. \r\n\r\nVazha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan Vazha wants to open a Georgian bread bakery.

She is 19 years old. She is a dynamic, hard-working, and entrepreneurial young woman with a great desire to advance and better herself every day. Her parents gave her support so that she could study and graduate as a certified public accountant. Unfortunately, she was not able to practice her profession as such since she made the decision to marry at an early age, and as a homemaker, other needs arose, including a daughter. Along with her husband, they decided to look for better opportunities to advance, and they saw the need in their town to set up a business that does not have much competition, a confectionery. She has a great desire to have another activity beyond being a homemaker. Her husband is a graduate from the same course in public accounting, and he now works in FUDEINFA, a technical branch of the COMIXMUL cooperative, as an evaluator of projects, where the income that he earns brings the necessities to their home. Together they saw the need that one of the two had to see a way of generating a little more income, and so the opportunity was presented to Glevis to take a course in confectionery given by the FUDEINFA institution, and thanks to the cooperative, she learned to manage in a different way.\r\n\r\nGlevis is now applying for assistance to buy a display case, pots, casseroles, spatulas, and a

She has learned to survive despite the lack of work caused by her lack of education. Due to various circumstances, she was only able to finish primary school. Now she lives in a common law marriage with her spouse, Ram\u00f3n, who is 57. He supports the home with his work as a farmer and she has 6 children with him, whom they raised and supported until they left home to be on their own and work for themselves. Right now, Angela lives with her husband in the parish of R\u00edo Verde in the Santo Domingo canton of Ecuador. Everyone in the area knows her as an enterprising and hardworking woman who fights for her dreams every day. \r\n \r\nAngela helped her husband with the farming, but the need in the home grew and 16 years ago she decided to start selling sets of pots and casual clothes.  She learned about sales in her native home of Calceta. It is a small town characterized as being very commercial. In fact, the biggest obstacle she has had is starting her life over again in a new city that she wasn't familiar with, where she was very well received. Now she is asking for a loan to acquire merchandise and improve her corner house where she has her locale so it will get people's attention and the people who seek her out on her customers' recommendation can find her more easily. Angela is taking out her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa thanks to the recommendation of her daughter, who told her about the trust and support that this entity gives entrepreneurs in vulnerable areas. Angela hopes that with this loan, her sales will increase and she can see her business become an excellent commercial business that gives her what she needs to have a nice old age at her husband's side.

The rural village, founded in 1880, is home to a people who are friendly and happy, despite the area\u2019s typically cold weather.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Patachaj Trust Bank was founded by seven local women. With the addition of six new members this year, the group has grown to 13 enthusiastic women, excitedly awaiting their loans from Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nTeresa is one of the new members. She is 31 years old and married to a day laborer named Alejandro. The couple has three children, two girls and one boy, who attend the local elementary school. Teresa and her husband, who were themselves unable to attend school beyond the second grade, are dedicated to keeping their children in school.\r\n \r\nA year ago, when Teresa noticed that her husband's income was not enough to support their family, she started a small business selling tortillas.  Currently using a wood stove, she is restricted to selling the tortillas on the road outside her home three days a week. She joined Patachaj Trust Bank so she could buy a gas stove. A gas stove, which is more economical and easier to transport, would allow her to locate her business in San Cristobal Totonicapan\u2019s busy market center, ten minutes from her home. Her goal is to work at least four days a week in her business.  \r\n\r\nBesides Teresa\u2019s tortilla business, the women in Patachaj Trust Bank hand-embroider blouses, manufacture clothing, and own small convenience stores, among other enterprises. The loans and monthly training they receive from their involvement in Friendship Bridge\u2019s microcredit program expand their businesses and keep their children in school. They all expressed their gratitude to KIVA investors for helping to develop them and their families.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4053.48,"image":{"id":1300260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The Trust Bank, whose name means \u201ccherry\u2019s heart\u201d is located in the western highlands of Guatemala in rural Patachaj, San Cristobal Totonicapan. Currently the group has ten members, half of whom are starting their third loan cycle. The other half are new members. The women's businesses include animal husbandry, weaving, embroidery and garment-making.\r\n\r\nOne of the women, Ana, is 32 years old and has one son. She makes skirts and embroidered blouses, typical of Guatemala, which she sells wholesale.  She started her business five years ago, and joined the Chucuxcabel Trust Bank when it started in 2011, so that she could hire employees to help expand her business. Proudly, today she provides jobs to six women, all of whom are better able to support their large families because of their employment with Ana. In her third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge, Ana plans to buy yarn and fabric in preparation for the annual Easter holiday. This year she hopes her team will be able to start work early in order to meet the customer demand.\r\n\r\nAna and the other members of Chucuxcabel have paid back their previous loans and are requesting a new one. By allowing them to grow their businesses, the loans have a great impact on their lives and those of their families. Ana, in particular, has benefited from Friendship Bridge\u2019s microcredit program which, in addition to the loans, provides monthly training sessions to discuss issues like women\u2019s health, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, and business management. \r\n\r\nThe Chucuxcabel Trust Bank appreciates the help from KIVA investors as it encourages them to continue investing in

She has consolidated her business in a very busy corner of her town and that permits her to have clients at any moment. \r\n\r\nThere she attends daily to all the people who show up, satisfying their thirst above all on weekends after they take part in strenuous sports activities in a park near her work establishment. She has been working in this business for 10 years and she works alone. \r\n\r\nIn her home she also sells soda, ice and lollipops. Her work generates a good income, which helps her to cover her basic needs and dedicate another part of her earnings to family savings. However, she has seen that currently there is a great need in her neighborhood: a lack of food sales spots. This is why she has decided to also opt for that line of work and tempt fate. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to complement her current work with a food stand. At this moment she is requesting 800 Peruvian soles, for which she thanks all those who make this loan possible since with it she can realize her plans. She also commits to making her payments in a punctual fashion. \r\n\r\nWith the amount requested she will buy sodas and energy drinks so she can continue working, as well as buying the necessary ingredients to launch her food sales business, including chickens, rice, eggs, oil, and more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1302533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sodas, energy drinks and cooking ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-27T16:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-29T16:00:09Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herminia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":118.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":127.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":137.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.05,"local_amount":118.28,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":124.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869009,"comment":null},{"amount":52.05,"local_amount":128.12,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":134.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577849,"comment":null},{"amount":51.85,"local_amount":127.64,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":134.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530080,"comment":null},{"amount":55.93,"local_amount":137.66,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":144.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975111,"comment":null},{"amount":58.01,"local_amount":142.79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:08Z","rounded_local_amount":150.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996380,"comment":null},{"amount":59.11,"local_amount":145.51,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":152.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863865,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-01T01:59:50Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":531895,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Janet, whose previous loan was a big help to her business.
