She sells rubber bowls, buckets and food containers. She has been running this business since 2002. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night.   Abiatu says that her business is going well because she started with a small amount through BRAC.\r\n\r\nAbiatu has requested a loan to buy rubber bowls, buckets and food containers.

She works selling secondhand footwear such as shoes, sports shoes, sandals and others. She sells her products from a location she rents, and she always waits on her customers with a kind smile. She started selling only secondhand items, but with time she increased her working capital and now she also sells new footwear. She has been working at this business for four years now, and she would like to continue working at it for many more. She considers her business a success because of the profits she receives from it and because she has many repeat customers. She likes her business very much because it provides her with a fixed income stream that she uses to pay her expenses.

At first, she didn't have enough money to hire workers or to replace the various trees on their land that were not producing.  A relative provided her with small loans to solve the problems that she had.  Over the years, she managed through her earnings to buy another parcel of land where she expanded her cocoa plantings and thereby progressively increased her income.  She frequently hires workers from the area who assist her with the weeding and the harvest of her cocoa beans.  \r\n\r\nOver time, with her earnings, she wants to improve her house and rebuild it with bricks and cement so that she can improve her family's quality of life.  This is her first loan with Kiva, and she feels grateful for the financial support that she is receiving that will help her to continue to make progress.  In addition, she promises to make her payments on time.  She wants to borrow 1,000 Peruvian soles to buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":170.51,"image":{"id":1383972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-07-06T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-05T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":97.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":99.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":107.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":107.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":114.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":117.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.27,"local_amount":78.04,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":81.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997393,"comment":null},{"amount":34.27,"local_amount":91.41,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":95.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864857,"comment":null},{"amount":32.8,"local_amount":87.45,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":91.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353224,"comment":null},{"amount":36.49,"local_amount":97.3,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904990,"comment":null},{"amount":37.68,"local_amount":100.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-24T09:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":104.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090991,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T16:44:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":579864,"name":"Matilda's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Matilda is married and 43.

34-year-old Umu from Port Loko  in the northern area of Sierra Leone. She is married with one child aged 14 years, and she has two additional dependents who live with her because they are relatives. In 2001, Umu established her grocery store business. She began her business because she needed to contribute in supporting the home. She works at the business every day, 12 hours per day. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nUmu requires a loan in order to buy more ketchup, baby food, mayonnaise, and assorted drinks. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business so she can attract customers and improve her family's standard of living. In the future, Umu plans to import her goods from a neighboring country. She thanks you for your

from Sierra Leone! This is 42-year-old Mabinty from Lunsar's northern area. She is married with 6 children between the ages of 9 years and 24 years. Her children are currently going to school. She also has 10 additional dependents at home.\r\n\r\nMabinty runs a grocery store selling items at her house; she sells milk, pure water, soda, and biscuits. She has been running this business since 2006. She works at the business throughout the week from morning to night. Mabinty says that her business is doing well because she started with a small amount through BRAC.\r\n\r\nMabinty has requested a loan in order to buy more biscuits, milk, pure water, and drinks to sell. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. In the future, she plans to open a permanent business residence. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":418.55,"image":{"id":1383359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

from Sierra Leone! This is 39-year-old Fatmata from Lunsar. She is widowed with 5 children between the ages of 8 years and 23 years. Three of her children are currently going to school.  \r\n\r\nFatmata runs a general store, selling items at her house; she sells soap, milk, pure water, soda, and biscuits. She has been running this business for 18 years and she works at the business throughout the week from morning to night. Fatmata says that her major problem is the lack of enough capital to run her business. \r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy more soap, milk, pure water, and drinks. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her life. In the future, she plans to open a big shop. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":176.63,"image":{"id":1383366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

35-year-old Saffie from Lunsar's northern area in Sierra Leone. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 3 years and 15 years, and has 2 additional dependents that live with her because they are relatives. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Saffie established her cosmetics business. She began her business because she needed to create income to support her home. She works at the business 7 days per week and 8 hours per day. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and sometimes sales are very slow.\r\n\r\nSaffie requires a loan in order to buy more body cream, soap, baby power, and perfume to sell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business so she can attract customers and improve her family's standard of living. In the future, Saffie plans to import her goods from a neighboring country. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":229.61,"image":{"id":1383367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She is married to Emilio and they have 5 children who live with them in a house they own, made out of wood. Zenobia makes a living growing cocoa and other products native to her region. Together with her husband, she works on a plot of land of 2.5 hectares that is their principal source of income. Zenobia learned how to farm when she was very young because her parents also made a living in this way. When she became an adult, she got married and since then has worked alongside her husband, who was able to buy the plot of land they now possess.\r\n\r\nZenobia's principal objective from the beginning of the planting season has been to keep her crops in good condition and in compliance with organic certification requirements. This way she will be able to harvest them without problems and sell the products to recover the money she invested plus some extra profit. In order to improve the quality of the harvests she used to have, Zenobia uses organic fertilizer on her soil. She also used to hire local workers who helped her to complete all of the labor of weeding and other tasks that can be overwhelming.

His wife is a cook and currently works at a kindergarten kitchen. Their daughter goes to kindergarten. \r\n\r\nThe interior components of their house are deteriorated. During wintertime, frost forms around the windows and wind seeps through the walls, which chills the family to their core. For this reason, Batsaikhan is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase insulating materials such as fiberglass, foam, and cotton. Using these materials, he can insulate the walls of the house with fiberglass and other items. As a result, the family won't need to burn a lot of coal for heating. Reducing the amount of coal they use will release fewer pollutants into the atmosphere and contribute to efforts against air pollution.

He is a well-known farmer in the area, and cultivates cocoa dynamically. He has his own land for this activity. He hires local labourers during the seasons where maintenance is required, and for harvesting. He enjoys his work a great deal because he is able to make a very good income. The only thing that discourages him at times is transporting sacs of his cocoa to the lower area of his locality, because the land is very sloped and this generates additional transportation costs.

He thinks that the best way to deal with this pest, in most cases, is to replace the plants and constantly monitor the crops.

However, the class was full, and fate led him to sign up for a class in the \u201celectrical trades.\u201d The class was very hands-on from the first day, and Charlton discovered that he loved working with circuit boards. This experience began Charlton\u2019s lifelong passion for electronics. He went on to have a 33-year career working for power companies like Dyna Electric and the San Onofre power plant. \r\n\r\nWith the most recent recession, Charlton struggled as there was little work for electricians. In an effort to reinvent himself, Charlton took marketing and drafting classes at a San Diego community college. He also set up a cleaning business, but found the hours grueling and the work unrewarding. \r\n\r\nCharlton finally chose to return to the trade that he deeply values. In 2009, rather than seeking employment, he decided to take control of his own destiny and obtained his independent contractor license. He started Light Duty Electric, an electrical services business in Oceanside, California, and as the construction industry began to recover, business quickly picked up.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Charlton works 14 to 16 hours a day and takes pride in the skills he has honed. He has a reputation as an honest and skilled electrician. Charlton commits to providing customers with quality electrical work and to paying vendors in a timely manner. As his business grows, he plans to use his Kiva loan to pay for electrical materials and to help maintain a consistent cash flow.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to eventually be able to grow his business to the

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a mother of two children. Her husband owns and runs a fruit shop in the market which is the family's only source of income. He sells apples, bananas and oranges in his shop. He is interested in offering more variety to his customers which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However due to the lack of income he finds it difficult. Therefore his wife Asiya, as a member of a three person group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at profitable price. With the profit her husband wants to grow his business in the future.

is a 23-year-old married woman and mother of two children. Elvina  is an internally displaced person (IDP) and lives with her husband in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. She is a Fuzulu refugee. She has dedicated four years of her life to agriculture. She plants tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants and other vegetables and fruits. Her income from vegetable and fruit sales is 90 AZN. She has more plans for future, such as to get more land for cultivation. She is looking forward to increased sales in the coming summer, because people purchase more fruits at that time.\r\nShe has applied for a loan of 2000 AZN from Aqroinvest.

From this place there is a beautiful view of the city of Cuenca. For this reason it is known as the viewpoint of the city. Its geography is rugged, with beautiful landscapes and green fields. Its people are friendly, gracious, and very charismatic, and every day they look for ways to improve the economic stability of their households in order to offer a better future to their children. Their principal economic activity is agriculture and raising animals, and some work in the city in various workplaces.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Maria Rosa, who is now in her third loan cycle, along with her friends and fellow group members from Camino al Progreso, a group that she likes a lot, since she shares good moments with her neighbors, leaves the routine of her work, and at the same time learns from the educational talks that they receive.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Maria Rosa is 43 years old. She is married, and she and her husband have five children, ages 23, 21, 18, 15, and 12. Her oldest, a daughter, works and helps her economically. Her second child, a son, is married and lives independently. Her next two children work but only for their personal expenses, and her last son lives at home. Her husband works as a bricklayer. The house where they live is their own.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Maria Rosa works in agriculture. What she harvests is for the household consumption, and she sells what is left. She also raises chickens, pigs, and guinea pigs.\r\n\r\nShe is going to invest her loan in the purchase of chickens, guinea pigs, and construction materials to make a bigger chicken coop.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to grow in her animal-raising business.\r\n\r\nThe little photo is of two members who were not able to be present when the group photo was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":1384051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens, guinea pigs, and construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-07-07T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-06T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Trancito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4685.78,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":390.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":783.33,"local_amount":780.96,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":783.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566755,"comment":null},{"amount":783.33,"local_amount":780.96,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":783.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815773,"comment":null},{"amount":783.33,"local_amount":780.96,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":783.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410965984,"comment":null},{"amount":1174.99,"local_amount":1171.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1174.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857720,"comment":null},{"amount":783.33,"local_amount":780.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":783.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506104,"comment":null},{"amount":391.69,"local_amount":390.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":391.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439729894,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-30T17:04:27Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:08:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":580063,"name":"Lonie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lonie is 52 years old and married with one child in school.

has been involved in agriculture for 25 years. Over these years of hard work Ayvaz currently runs a beautiful and profitable farm. He lives with his son and wife who run the farming business with him. Currently Ayvaz keeps on his farm 2 cows, 34 sheep, and 20 chickens. The family also owns a plot of land where different types of trees are cultivated (peach, apricot, apple, nut and pear).\r\n\r\nTogether with agriculture, Ayvaz also works as a driver, but unfortunately the salary he gets is hardly enough for covering basic needs. Ayvaz sells the gathered agricultural products in the local market and earns income which is vital for covering the family's daily needs. So, realizing that agriculture is very important for him, Ayvaz would like to enlarge his farm. Now, with a good credit history behind him, Ayvaz is requesting this loan. With the loan's help he plans to purchase 2 oxen and 5 pigs and he hopes that this will significantly improve his farm and will increase his income.\r\n\r\nAyvaz does his best to improve his family's living conditions and ensure a better life for his son and wife.

is 47 years old. She is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with her husband and children in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. She is a hard-working person who takes care of her family by doing business in animal husbandry.  Ulkar grows cattle and raises them to sell meat. She has been in this business for 10 years. \r\n\r\nHer husband  supports her  in the business. The business takes a lot of effort, but together they run it successfully. She sells the meat in the central bazaar, where the demand for meat is high. People in Azerbaijan consume meat a lot, because it is used in most dishes. Some traditional meals like kebabs, dolma and others require beef in their preparation. Her profit is 130 AZN monthly.

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his wife and children   in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He is a Fuzuli refugee.  For past four years he has been raising sheep because mutton is in high demand in this region. Samir is a retired person with an income of 100 AZN monthly from this business. This is a very profitable business and Samir  is doing it together with his wife.\r\n\r\nHe is keeping a flock of sheep in his own yard. He fattens them and takes their meat to the central bazaar, where butchers and customers purchase from him. People use mutton for traditional dishes like kababs, dolmas, pilovs, etc.\r\n\r\nHe has taken out a loan from Aqroinvest before and has a good loan history. This is going to be his fifth loan.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Aleksandre has a shop. He sells detergents and hygiene products. Aleksandre is purchasing everything at the wholesale price and sells with the price mark up to earn a small monthly income, which is the only source of living for the family.\r\n\r\nAleksandre requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Aleksandre has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Aleksandre will increase the stock of products for his shop. He wants to have more varieties of detergents and hygiene products to offer better choice to his clients.

In particular, they have a plot of land and chickens. On the land, fruit and nut trees are grown. Harvested products are sold together with eggs at the local markets.

Meri has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

They have two milk cows, two calves, a pig, and a plot of land where vegetables are grown. The cows are milked every day to produce cheese. From the pig they sell piglets. The family members are very hard-working people, and they all are involved in their agriculture. The harvested products and cheese are sold at the local Senaki market. As the family has a refugee status, they get an additional income from local government institutions. \r\n\r\nTsitsino requested a loan from Credo to start-up the family business. Tsitsino has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Tsitsino will start trading clothes.

He lives in a small village named Akhuti in Chkhorotsku District. He lives with his wife, retired mother, and two school-going children. \r\n\r\nTemur has been unsuccessful in acquiring a loan from local financial institutions to start a family business. His loan requests were rejected because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. In addition to farming income, Temur's mother has a monthly pension and a salary of 180 Lari from working at the local kindergarten.\r\n \r\nThe family has two milk cows and a plot of arable land. The cows are milked daily and the milk is made into dairy products. Nut and bay trees are grown on the land. Both the harvested and dairy products are sold at the local markets. \r\n\r\nTemur requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. He has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with flexible conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products. The rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Temur will renovate a commercial space and purchase groceries to open a grocery shop.

lives and works outside of Kamukuywa, near Kitale town in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. His home is located close to the Ugandan border and Mount Elgon, an extinct volcano which straddles the two nations and even has a peak. Founded by European settlers in the early 1900s, Kitale originally grew due to its proximity to the Ugandan railway, which has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years. The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover on behalf of the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping. Kitale is the headquarters of the Kenya Seed Company, whose massive sunflower plantations provide nearby bees with a veritable buffet of high-quality forage. \r\n\r\nHenry is married and has nine children. Both he and his wife have been farming for 35 years and are currently growing maize, vegetables and ground nuts on their land.

","en":"Muniskhon is the beloved mother of three grown children and a homemaker. She is 44 years old. She is married; her husband is a migrant worker in Russia. Difficult economic conditions forced her husband to become a migrant worker and earn a living abroad. Muniskhon takes care of the household on her own. She has operated a business for over four years. She began her business selling women's clothing, and now sells children's clothing, as the demand for it is greater than for women's. Muniskhon runs the business herself, and is the sole provider for the family. She spends all her money on food products.
