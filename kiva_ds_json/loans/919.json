The businesses that the members of the communal association carry out are varied: sale of pork rinds, knitting alpaca and vicuna wool blankets, sewing skirts, sale of fried potato chips, sale and delivery of jewels. The loan they will get will help small micro-entrepreneurs, including Fermina. Fermina tells that this is the first time she is a member of Pro Mujer, and she entered thanks to the invitation from a promoter of the institution that went over to her house to invite her. Currently she knits alpaca and vicuna wool blankets. She learned about this business from her mother a long time ago, since she helped her with the knitting. With time, she decided to start her own business. The loan she will take now is to buy supplies (buy wool at wholesale) from factories and will later on produce it and sell it at wholesale. This way of working allows her to generate resources to support her family, since she is single and has 3 children. When she is asked about what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the health area and the savings.

is 49, married to a farmer and has five children, all of whom attend school. He has been a rice farmer for eight years. He has requested a Kiva loan to use to meet labor costs. He plans to use the profits to pay his children's school fees and to pay for medical insurance.\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37 per cent of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65 per cent of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90 per cent of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

This work is the sole source of income for his family.  Uysyf previously worked in the Russian Federation.  Because his wife ran the household by herself and was involved in raising their five children, he decided to return to his homeland and bought a car with the money he earned in Russia in order to help his wife run the household and raise the children.  This is Uysyf's third loan.  He obtained his previous two loan to make small repairs to his car.  Uysyf wants to use this loan to install gas equipment because gasoline cost rose a lot, and this upgrade would decrease his expenses.

old, married and has five children.  In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1983 with an initial sum of 8,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to persistence and hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows with offspring and ten sheep, and the monthly profit from sales of milk and meat products amounts to about 8,000 som (KGS).  Meiyskul also works on 2.8 hectares of land, where she grows Bulgarian peppers and beans.

Her plan for the future is to build a business building and sell at wholesale prices.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1158611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy sugar and maize flour at wholesale prices, as well as cereals.

Como siembran en cantidad, no se abastecen con sus terrenos por lo que tienen que arrendar unos alternos, por eso desea con muchas ansias mejorar sus ingresos, para poder ahorrar y comprar m\u00e1s tierras y no gastar en el pago del alquiler.\n\nElla pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPuntaman puririsum Sachamarca\u201d, que en espa\u00f1ol significa \u201cAdelante caminemos Sachamarca\u201d. Este es su tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP y le gusta mucho el trabajo que realiza en su grupo, pues en cada reuni\u00f3n aprende nuevas ideas para sus sembr\u00edos, ya que todos se ayudan y cooperan, por ello promete ser puntual en pago de sus cuotas. \nLucinda invertir\u00e1 ahora en la compra de 30 sacos de fertilizantes naturales y si el dinero le alcanza comprar\u00e1 un par de ovejas. ","en":"Lucinda is 25 years old, and she lives in the house that she inherited four years ago along with her husband Edgar and their son Jhon.  Five years ago she began working in the field of agriculture.  Together with her husband they share the household responsibilities since that is not the only thing that they are dedicated to.  For her part, Lucinda takes care of their animals, raising pigs, sheep, cows and bulls, which she fattens and then sells.  Her husband, meanwhile, is in charge of organizing the planting of potatoes, beans, corn and peas.  \"We both have to work, since in the periods of planting and harvesting, there is a lot of work,\" she affirms.  Because they plant in quantity, their lands are not sufficient, so they have to rent some fields, and for this reason she greatly desires to improve their income, so that they can save and buy more land and not spend so much on rent.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Puntaman puririsum Sachamarca,\" which in Spanish means \"Adelante caminemos Sachamarca\" and in English \"Walking Forward Together (in the town of) Sachamarca.\"  This is her third credit with MFP and she very much likes the work that she accomplishes with her group.  In each meeting she learns new ideas for planting crops, since everyone helps and cooperates, and for that reason she promises to be punctual in the payment of her fees.  \r\n\r\nLucinda will invest now in the purchase of 30 sacks of natural fertilizers and if there is sufficient money she will also buy a pair of sheep.

She cares for them every day with a lot of hard work, because the products are very popular because they are of good quality.

The projects differ and change daily, and I\u2019m not the type that can do the same thing every day.\u201d Deborah has had her business for three years and now has 12 full-time staff members. In the future, she plans to hire more Hispanic female workers to keep up her Hispanic female business status.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about Accion Texas Inc. from her banker, Deborah decided to inquire about a loan. Upon approval, she used the loan for a truck and marketing. She says that since she got the loan, she has put advertisement on her truck and has received a large number of calls.

On the weekends, they work with their children: \"We teach them the family trade. We have all worked in it, since my ancestors,\" explains Alejandra. Now they are ready for the big harvest, where they sow the majority of their land.\r\n\r\nAlejandra belongs to the communal bank \"Puntaman puririsum Sachamarca,\" which in Quechua means to \"Let's go forward Sachamarca.\" This is her sixth loan with MFP, and she really likes the work she does in her group. In each meeting, she learns new ideas for her plantings, since everyone helps each other and cooperates. She promises to be punctual in making her payments.\r\n\r\nAlejandra will invest this money in the purchase of 100 sacks of natural fertilizer for her potato plantings, and if there is money left over, she will pay for the transport of the sacks to the selling location.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1156795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase 100 sacks of natural fertilizer for her potato plantings, and if there is enough money left, to pay for the transport of the sacks to the sales location.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-09T05:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-08T05:00:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1049.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373528938,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-09T17:07:59Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:18:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":457702,"name":"Luciano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luciano, 50 years old, is married to Flora, and they live in the community of Burgos in Isabela province.

There are twenty members, all with businesses such as clothes sales, stallholders, crafts, firewood sales, baker, weaving, services etc. They all live in the town of Temuco.\r\n\r\nRony is the President. He can be seen in the photo standing in the back row second from the right and wearing a dark brown jacket and a blue wool hat. He has earned his living for the last two years selling lemons and carrots in the various local markets. He works from 7:30am to 6:30pm. Rony buys the produce in small stores or sometimes in supermarkets at low prices, whichever is more financially beneficial. With the loan he plans to buy bags of lemons.\r\n\r\nOne of Rony's business goals is to have a permanent stall in the market so that he can have a calmer place in which to work, earn more money, and thus have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRony lives with his wife and two children aged 5 and 3. On a personal level his dream is to one day own a furniture workshop in his home as he does well in this line of work. However, he lacks the necessary tools to start this business. As well, he needs to spend more money in the home because his children are growing so he has to provide them with a good start to life.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy and grateful to have this opportunity with Fondo Esperanza which will allow him to invest in his business. Commenting on his Community Bank, he says that the members communicate well with each other. As well, the training provided has given him the opportunity to learn new sales and accounting techniques.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the region of Araucan\u00eda. The town is located 670 km south of Santiago, the capital of Chile. In the surrounding areas are lake resorts (Puc\u00f3n, Villarrica), and fascinating native plants and animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4175,"image":{"id":1157067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 2007 with an initial sum of 25,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to persistence and hard work, today her business contains two, four calves, ten sheep and one horse, and the monthly profit from sales of milk and meat products amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS).  Gulzar also works on 5.5 hectares of land, where she grows perennial herbs and barley.  In order to further develop her business, Gulzar requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls and sheep for fattening up.  In the future, she wants to increase her farm and expand her business by buying purebred livestock in order to save money and pay for her 16 year-old son's university

He believes his home will be warmer after the insulation and after he adds a new furnace. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long, cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40 Fahrenheit, even in the cities.  \r\n\r\nAlso, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. Additionally, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolian air pollution. \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers green loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy natural gas for cars.
