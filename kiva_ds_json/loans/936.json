She lives in the company of a granddaughter whom she raised like a daughter from 2 months of age, and who now is almost 5 years old.

Currently he shares a home with five of his children, but two of them depend on them financially: a 15-year-old girl who is in the ninth grade at school and a 17-year-old boy who is in his first year of high school. The other children are employees of commercial businesses. \n\nHe says he is satisfied with the work of making mud bricks and roofing tiles which he has done for the past 20 years. He started the business after he stopped being a member of the revolutionary army Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed Para La Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional. After the peace accords were signed he did not wish to return to his parents who were livestock farmers, out of fear of possible reprisals. Since he had nothing by which to earn a living, a friend encouraged him to take up the work of handcrafting mud bricks and roofing tiles. Thus he sought out persons who knew the business and learned from them until he was able to start his own production factory with two handmade ovens and up to six full-time employees depending on the season. With dedication to this activity he has achieved the purchase of two 8-ton trucks. \n\nHis raw materials for making the bricks and tiles he gets from neighboring lands (mud) and sand mines which are 25 km from his home and place of production. \n\nThe loan will be invested in the purchase of farming supplies and preparing the earth for planting 8.5 acres of sorghum with the goal of producing grain and stubble from the harvest for use in feeding the animals. \n\nOwing to climatic and soil conditions where he runs his livestock operation, grass is only produced during the winter season (June through September). Thus it is necessary to produce enough grass to supply food for his herd of livestock. Otherwise he would have problems and might possibly have to make the decision to sell them and leave two families without employment, who are the ones who help him carry out this business and who depend directly upon this employment. \n\nHe is confident of his experience and management abilities and wishes to grow his business, stating that he prefers self-employment since it allows him to spend more time with his family and improve relationships. Likewise his income is better than the minimal salary to which he could aspire were he to work as an employee.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1171217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase farming supplies and prepare the earth in order to plant 8.5 acres of sorghum.

In order to be able to pay her university expenses, she first worked selling cell phone minutes.  After that she worked teaching writing classes.  Her mother is a school teacher, and her father has a small store.  They, along with her other five siblings, continue living in Tumaco.\r\n\r\nPaola\u2019s dream is to get a Master\u2019s Degree in Cinematography and Audiovisual Technology in France.  In order to do so she needs to request support from Kiva.  It is the only way to be able to cover the expenses of the language exams and the university application fees. \r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nWhen I left high school I aspired to study at the university.  At this time I lived in Tumaco, my native city, which is on the Pacific coast of Colombia.  At first I thought it was impossible because of my financial limitations.  Nevertheless, I was accepted, and I enrolled at the Universidad del Valle.  From there my story begins, full of challenges and opportunities that I was able to negotiate upon being, not only in another city, but also with financial obstacles.  It was thanks to my grades and support from the University, family, and friends that I completed my undergraduate studies in Social Communication.  What joy!\r\n\r\nNow I have the dream of studying abroad and learning about other cultures in order to contribute to my country\u2019s development.  I know that this is not an easy road.  Fortunately, a year ago I received the support of the \u201cPrograma de Semilleros de Talentos Regionales\u201d [The \u201cSeed Bed\u201d Program for Talented Students in the Region].  The support came through a language scholarship to study French.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle to continue with my professional and personal development I turn to Kiva for the support to continue harvesting triumphs, to return to my region all of my knowledge, to be a better person, and to know the world.  I am sure that in 2014 I will be in France getting my Master\u2019s Degree.\r\n\r\nWhen I return to Colombia after getting my Master\u2019s Degree, I have the dream of being able to make a documentary that shows all of the armed conflict that exists in my region.  I also want to make people aware of the cultural uprooting that takes place as the result of the forced displacement due to the war that is currently taking place in the country.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1185448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay the application expenses to study for a Master's Degree in Cinematography and Audio Visual Technology.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-01T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-01T16:20:10Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":914500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042081,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-01T17:32:50Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":457981,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is a 38-year-old man with 4 children living in Kagadi, Uganda.

Ingrid con olfato de negocio le propuso a su madre asociarse con su t\u00edo, para hacer de ese lote una terraza refrescante. Empezaron vendiendo cervezas, poni malta, gaseosas e hicieron una peque\u00f1a pista donde bailar al aire libre; poco a poco este negocio se hizo mas popular, pero fueron present\u00e1ndose grandes desaf\u00edos como el deterioro de la salud de su t\u00edo y su madre ya no atendi\u00f3 mas el negocio.

Su meta es lograr convertir su negocio en un punto comercial frio reconocido por todos los negocios que est\u00e1n el sector donde est\u00e1 ubicada , para genera mas ingresos y un mayor bienestar para los suyos. ","en":"Ingrid, 27, lives in the beautiful city of Cartagena de Indias, a colonial-style city located in the middle of the Caribbean coastline at the far northeast of Colombia. There she has a beverage shop where she sells mainly beer and Pony Malta. Her idea for the business came eight years ago, upon noticing that on a lot next to where she lived which was owned by her mother, her neighbors would meet with a lot of camaraderie, to chat about life and what was happening around them, to the sound of music provided by her uncle, through his equipment: a large-sized pick up truck.\r\n\r\nIngrid, with her business sense, suggested that her mother work with her uncle to make this lot a refreshing terrace. They began selling beers, Pony Malta, and soft drinks, and they made a small open-air dance floor. Little by little, this business became more popular, but there were great challenges, like the decline of her uncle's health, and that her mother no longer attended to the business.\r\n\r\nThis is how Ingrid took it up, moving to selling only beer and soft drinks by the case to small businesses nearby. Her cooler was filled through her mother's references with the supplier, which passed to Ingrid, and she has been able to maintain them. That is how she has had credit with these suppliers four years, but as her customer-base has grown, she needs more capital since her sales are good but limited to the credit that she has. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy a greater volume of beers and soft drinks in general. Her goal is to convert her business into a commercial cooler recognized by all the businesses in the area where she is located, to obtain more income and a better wellbeing for her loved ones.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarilyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving a good and quality education to her children through all her hard work in her business.
