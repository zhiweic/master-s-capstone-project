Nuru, who is in her early 30s with a boy attending school, has been in her businesses for fours years now. She is working hard to see her businesses doing better. Nuru works from 9 am to 6 pm daily and is able to make a good return each month. \r\n\r\nThis is her 10th loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans to start her two chicken businesses. She also bought more stock of clothes for her other business. Nuru has paid back all her previous loans successfully. With the profit received, she covered school fees and household expenses and started a building. She will use this loan to buy more local chickens and clothes to resell.

40-year-old Mamusu from Waterloo in the eastern area in Freetown. She is married with 5 children from age 3 years to 22 years. In 2003, Mamusu established her food stock business. She began her business because she was a housewife but she wanted to create her own source of income to contribute to taking care of the children. She works at the business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and the high cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nMamusu requires a loan in order to purchase rice, cooking seasonings and coconut oil to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and increase her business. In the future, Mamusu plans to expand her business more.

from Sierra Leone! This is 45-year-old Isatu from Tombo in the Western rural area in Freetown. She is married and blessed with 6 children between the ages of 8 years and 27 years. Two of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nIsatu runs a cookery business at home. She sells cooking items at her house. She has been running this business since 2007. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Isatu says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation and insufficient finances to expand her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items like rice, palm oil and cooking seasonings. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to open a big restaurant.

47-year-old Isatu from Tombo in the Western rural area in Freetown.

from Sierra Leone! This is 32-year-old Fatu from Tombo in the Western rural area in Freetown. She is married and blessed with 3 children between the ages of 4 years and 16 years. Two of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nFatu runs a cookery business at home; she sells cooked food at her house. She has been running this business since 2008. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Fatu says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation and insufficient finances to expand her business.\r\n\r\nFatu has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items like rice, palm oil and cooking seasonings. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to build a house. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":81.82,"image":{"id":1402999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

meet Chelsea from Liberia who is single and has five children with ages ranging from 16 to 2. Chelsea attended grade school and stopped her studies in the 7th grade. Two of her children are staying with their father and three are staying with her at home. She stated that she is aware that the two children with their father are in school. Among the three who live with her, only two are attending school, while the young one stays at home with her. \r\n\r\nChelsea explained how she has been going to the wholesale center to buy cassava, coconut and peanuts by the bag to resell. She sells from 8am to 5pm Monday to Saturday. She uses a bike to lug her goods from the village to the main road and uses a taxi from the main road to the city of Paynesville south, in Monrovia, Liberia. \r\n\r\nShe started this business by selling corn from the roadside with a little money from her mother, who taught her how to do this out-of-town-business. Chelsea expressed how she loves the buying, and she is proud of her business because she believes God directs more customers to her business every day, and that can cause her goods to be sold quicker. \r\n\r\nShe plans to buy a piece of land and build a house. Also she hopes that her children will have a bright future, as she is trying her best to educate them. She gives thanks to the lenders of Kiva for supporting the program and empowering small business people. God should bless them.

He dedicated his working life to making a living as an employee in a shoe factory, where he gained knowledge and experience in this trade. This enabled him to go independent and set up his own workshop in his home. Here, he makes sandals, trainers, shoes, and boots, which he sells in different towns in Antioquia department. He has been doing this for 13 years, and it has enabled him to make enough earnings to support his household. \r\n\r\nOrlando is a creative, dynamic, enterprising and enthusiastic person.

This will allow him to deliver the product in time and increase his sales and, in turn, his income.

She lives together with her spouse and their 5 children in their own house. Dolores raises livestock and sells food. She prepares the food to later sell it to the people who are familiar with its good taste. Her work is going very well, so well that she recently began making various fruit juices. But since Dolores is a hard-working woman, she also raises cattle. She already has 3 cows and 2 calves, which allows her to make small cheeses called \u201cbolillos.\u201d Later, she sells these in the nearest city on market day. Now, Dolores wants to continue working harder and to have a solid income without difficulties. This is Dolores\u2019s second loan with Kiva, and she is grateful for all the financial support that she receives to continue moving ahead. She promises to make her monthly payment on time. Dolores will invest the 800 Peruvian Soles in buying organic fertilizer to nourish the alfalfa crops that she uses to feed her animals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.19,"image":{"id":1406764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer to grow food for her animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-09T17:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-08T17:30:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":70.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":72.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":81.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87.43},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":91.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":94.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.61,"local_amount":65.63,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":68.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865170,"comment":null},{"amount":26.38,"local_amount":70.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":73.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353536,"comment":null},{"amount":27.06,"local_amount":72.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":75.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905299,"comment":null},{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":75.05,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":78.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091292,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-09T18:46:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591391,"name":"Isha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 30-year-old Isha from the Tombo Western rural area in Freetown.

The members of the communal bank have various businesses: selling cleaning products, natural medicine, shoes, cosmetics, CDs, and groceries.\r\n\r\nThe loan will benefit the group of small microbusinesses where Ms. Erika is a member. It has been a year since she joined Pro Mujer because she was invited by a friend who is a member of the institution. Currently, she has a business selling natural products. She opened this business under the advice of her aunt who did the same activity. It is a good business now.\r\n \r\nThe loan that Dolores is taking out now is to buy natural medicine. She hopes to increase the money that she will make by selling the medicine at the markets in El Alto and later in her own shop. This kind of work allows her to generate revenue to maintain her home, since she is single and also supports her mother. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Erika responds that she likes the trainings on credit and health.

She is married to Wilfredo, a driver, and is mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nAvelina operates a recycling shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to recycling shops for a little profit. These shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1000 in sales every day.  Avenlina also has a piggery for additional income. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Avenlina is requesting a PHP 23,000 loan. She will be incorporating this loan to her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAvelina dreams that her business will flourish and her children will finish their studies.

With the fruits of her labour she will buy a house and a car, continue in her profession and obtain a Master\u2019s degree. \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1405313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"to obtain an education in graphic design and advertising at Corporaci\u00f3n Las Mercedes  vocational college ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-09T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-08T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dayanna Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":770000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":154.55,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":292013.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780597,"comment":null},{"amount":41.4,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":78218.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539972,"comment":null},{"amount":26.92,"local_amount":48765,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50857.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752500,"comment":null},{"amount":202.13,"local_amount":366235,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-29T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":381948.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845807,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-10T00:45:03Z","paid_date":"2013-12-29T09:39:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591496,"name":"Noeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noeun (in the photo) is 42 years old.

For years she struggled with illness, which led to crippling depression. Maria fought against her sickness and the difficult emotional effects. \u201cI asked for help and nurtured a strong faith in God,\u201d Maria shared. A resilient woman, Maria battled illness for a decade and eventually recovered. \r\n\r\nAlong the way to healing, Maria met others who struggled with severe physical disabilities and disease. Everyone she met yearned to regain control over their lives by developing skills to live productive lives. \u201cPeople just want to be able to take care of themselves and contribute meaningfully to their community,\u201d said Maria. \r\n\r\nReflecting on her experiences, Maria felt that there was not enough available for those who are alone and unable to care for themselves.  She studied to become a caregiver for others, and today Maria has provided care and support to disabled people for almost a decade. Becoming further resolved to help people get back on their feed, she eventually decided to open a special home for people in need. Nanies Family Home will take in people leaving the hospital and in need of long-term care to return to productive life.\r\n\r\nTo start the business, Maria needs funding to install the right safety equipment in her home and for proper insurance. A Wells Fargo banker suggested she look into getting a Kiva loan through Accion San Diego, a local microlender.  A Kiva loan of $2,000 will provide the required insurance and enable Maria to create a secure home to set up her business of caring for others during the most vulnerable times of their lives.\r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s vision is to provide service across San Diego, providing the best quality care for people in need of it. \u201cI picture the sun\u2019s rays filling the home, and it gives me peace to know that people will have the hands they need to hold them up,\u201d she shared with a

is a 31-year-old married man who lives with his 28-year-old wife and 2-year-old daughter in Khoni district.  Nowadays, the family is without a source of income.  There is a high unemployment rate in the region but self-employment helps inhabitants to make living.  So, Shota decided to start his own business with a loan.  Unfortunately, the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  As a result of not satisfying these requirements, his credit requests were rejected several times.  \r\n\r\nShota received the credit in the framework of a start-up program, which is a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  This program enables the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  With a credit of $3,500, Shota will purchase tires for his truck.  Once tires are purchased, he will be able to work in transportation and generate income.  It is obvious that the job is hard, as he will sometimes need to drive long distances.  But he is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop his business gradually.\r\n\r\nThe Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased.

He is single and lives in the Terjola district with his parents. Goderdzi is unemployed at the moment and the only source of income for the family is a small salary earned by Goderdzi\u2019s father, who works as an artisan in spite of his chronic health problems.\r\n\r\nHowever, his father's earnings are not enough to cover the cost of food and everyday expenses. For this reason, Goderdzi decided to start a dairy farm. Goderdzi's loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with reasonable terms to start-up businesses. These loans are provided to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low incomes. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase a milking cow.

is 41 years old. He lives in the Khashuri District with his mother, wife and an infant child. Datuna\u2019s mother is retired and gets a monthly pension. Datuna runs a small scale agricultural business and grows grapes, maize and beans on his own plot of land. The harvest is sold at the local open market. In addition, Datuna is a builder and works on orders from time to time. However, his income is not enough for the family and they live in poverty. They receive a small social assistance benefit from the government. \r\n\r\nDatuna has requested a loan to start a dairy farm. His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with reasonable terms to start-up businesses. These loans are provided to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low incomes. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used for purchasing a milking cow.

He is married, and lives with his wife and mother in the small village of Chokhatauri district. His mother is provided with a retirement pension.  As his wife has health problems, she gets small monthly pension from government institutions, which is hardly enough for medicines. \r\n\r\nShota is actively involved in agricultural activities. Specifically, he has two milk cows and a calf. In addition, he has a plot of agricultural land, where maize and nut trees are grown. He cultivates the land and does all the agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. The harvested products are sold at local markets. \r\n\r\nAs the existing income is not enough for the family, he decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Shota applied for the credit to MFO Credo.

She is grateful for the received financial support as it will allow her to improve her income and so she promises to be punctual with the payment of her installments. \r\n\r\nPaulina will invest the 500 soles (PEN) in the purchase of organic fertilizer for her alfalfa planting.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":91.81,"image":{"id":1407232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-10T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-09T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":59.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":61.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":63.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":66.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":71.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.47},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.08,"local_amount":52.71,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":58.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865172,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":56.25,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":62.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353538,"comment":null},{"amount":23.64,"local_amount":59.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":66.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905301,"comment":null},{"amount":24.59,"local_amount":61.47,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":68.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091294,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-10T21:50:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591583,"name":"Evergista","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evergista is a 47-year-old farmer from the town of San Miguel, Bohol.

She is very thankful to Ceprodel for the loan opportunity and the support they have given her to improve the condition of her home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":176.82,"image":{"id":1406909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"purchase a latrine, lumber, nails, doors, cement, sand, smooth iron and pay for labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Telica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-08-10T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-09T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saida Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":570.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":756.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":826.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":842.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":893.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":914.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":952.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1029.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1035.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1088.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1177.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1219.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1270.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1298.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.83,"local_amount":570.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":578.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399789149,"comment":null},{"amount":30.27,"local_amount":756.71,"processed_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":767.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410065469,"comment":null},{"amount":33.04,"local_amount":826.08,"processed_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":837.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419829357,"comment":null},{"amount":52.41,"local_amount":1310.3,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1328.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430385128,"comment":null},{"amount":38.27,"local_amount":956.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T09:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":969.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978823,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-24T19:15:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591593,"name":"Muhit B Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dimngai is the featured borrower member for Muhit B SHG Group. She is pictured with her hand raised, on the extreme left. Twelve women members from the village joined hands and formed the group to support and assist each other financially and morally in times of need. The presence of Dorcas SHG and Sarah SHG in the village gives awareness about the advantage and benefit of a Self Help Group and its existence. All group members reside in a village which is about 35 kms away from the capital town of Imphal, which is one of the North-Eastern States in India.\r\n\r\nDimngai is a hard-working woman and believes in sheer effort to make a living. She raises cattle to generate an income for the family. Her husband earns his living as a farmer and she supplements the family income by raising cattle and weaving traditional women's wrap-around skirts. At present she has two female cows which produce milk. The milk is then sold every day in the neighbourhood. Her daily expenses are managed with her income from selling cow's milk. The cattle are also used on rental for ploughing paddy fields where tractors are not available and the payment is made based on the acres of land that are ploughed. \r\n\r\nDimngai usually gets the nutritional diet for cattle from the city market to keep the cattle healthy and strong. The cattle are also fed grass and refined dry grass. They are taken to the nearby fields to graze all day and feed on grass. Medical needs are provided on a regular basis whereas cattle are made to work at heavy labour and little care is granted by others. Most of the earnings are generally used to care for the cattle and cover household expenses. \r\n\r\nDimngai also weaves and sells finished woven wrap-around skirts to those who place an order. Despite working as a weaver and a cattle raiser she finds it hard to manage any monthly savings and she needs to renovate the cattle cow shed which leaked during the rainy season. The cattle are moved from the cow shed to a nearby shelter during rain.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Dimngai will purchase tin roofing, bricks and cement to re-construct the cow shed. She is delighted as the cattle will be kept in a protected shelter and she loves her cattle. She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful gift of a loan and says that she will repay the loan on time and will continue building good relationships with the organisation. She says \u201cThank you so much, Kiva!\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, piggery, vegetable selling, and the rice selling business, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1402956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase tin roofing, bricks and cement to reconstruct the cow shed for the cattle that she raises to generate an income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-10T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-09T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dimngai`","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimhoirei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhochin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neijahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nempi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thangkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikhokip","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T23:05:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":591596,"name":"Johnson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Johnson lives in Mombasa where he operates his own carpentry shop.

They sell the harvested products at the local market.\r\n\r\nDursun has made multiple loan requests, without success, from local financial institutions in order to start up a trading business. His loan requests were rejected each time due to low income. Dursun\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions. Borrowers are the vulnerable poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u2018high-risk borrowers\u2019 because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Dursun will purchase basic groceries and set up a store. He plans to increase the turnover in his trading business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.

yeas old, married, and has two children.  She has a higher education, and for a long time she worked as a high school teacher.  Today, she and her husband are retired, but they don't just sit around the house, rather they run their own small farm.  This is a business that Ainagul started in 1985 to be a source of income for her family.  She started the business with 2,000 som (KGS), but the good relationships that the family members have among themselves have allowed them to be successful.  Today her farm brings in a monthly profit of 10,000 som (KGS).  Ainagul has one milk cow and ten sheep.  She also has 1.2 hectares of land where she mainly grows beans and peppers.\r\n\r\nTo further develop her business, Ainagul applied to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy cows.  Ainagul plans to use the profits from the loan to increase the size of her herd of cattle and she intends to spend some money on repairing her

","en":"Luis, 22, is father to a 1-year-old baby and lives in a common-law marriage with his partner. Eight years ago, he learned to work in the fields, since he worked with his father. For 5 years, he has been working on a farm as a milker. His work alternates with agricultural activity, as he owns Creole potato and bean crops on a small leased plot. The loan recipient is an active, dynamic, enterprising young man and is devoted to his family and his work. \r\n\r\nLuis decided to request this loan to invest in the purchase of agricultural supplies (manure, fungicides, larvicides, and fertilizer) and to also pay to rent a tractor for 30 hours (each hour is worth $38,000 Colombian pesos) in order to give continuity to the care of his crops and have a harvest with high quality products. This way, he can sell them at a better price in the market, which will allow him to increase his revenue in order to give daily livelihood to his family.\r\n\r\nLuis dreams of owning a plot where he could have his crops, thus saving the money that he pays to lease land. That will be reflected in higher profitability and will allow him to have economic stability so that his child grows and develops in a healthy environment with better living conditions and well-being."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1407289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies (manure, fungicides, larvicides, and fertilizer) and to also pay to rent a tractor for 30 hours.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-10T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-09T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alfredo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":119994},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":123284},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":126665},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":130138},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":133706},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":137372},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":141139},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145009},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":148985},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":153071},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":157268},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":161580},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166011},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":170563},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175239},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":180044},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":184981},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":190053},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":195265},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200619},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":206120},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":211772},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":217578},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":223544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":593940,"name":"Nolvia Aracely","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nolvia, tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene tres hijos y vive con su esposo en una aldea del municipio de Macuelizo, Santa B\u00e1rbara.

is 33 years old and lives in the town of West Point. Her parent was not able to send her to school, but she believes that she is good at taking care of her business and her home affairs. She is not yet married but she and her fiance are living together. They have three children aged between 18 and 7. All three of them are attending school. \r\n\r\nFor five years now Bandu has been selling pepper, oil, bitter ball, okra, vita, etc. Some days the business is good; other days it's not. She learned how to do this business from her mother, and the best part of her work is that it keeps her busy. She sells six days in a week for 10 hours each day. Most often she uses a taxi to take her goods to her table business. \r\n\r\nShe established this business by selling cold water around from a wheelbarrow for two years, and she learned many ways of selling from her friends. She is glad today that she is independent. Bandu has requested a loan to purchase pepper, oil, bitter ball, okra, vita, etc. to increase her sales. In the future, she would like to have her own house and educate her children. She thanks BRAC and its supporters.
