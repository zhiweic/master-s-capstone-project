The members work in agriculture, buying and selling wood, repairing motorcycles, offering transportation services, and making artisan crafts. The members are thankful for the opportunity provided and promise to complete the payments for their different loans within the established time period. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2272.02,"image":{"id":1380207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","use":"purchase work materials such as tools, packaging, pots, and alcohol","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PIlcopata - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricvell Fredy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilberth Timoteo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elaine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1087.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1130.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1175.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1222.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1270.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":392.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":408.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":424.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":441.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":458.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":474.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":392.76,"local_amount":1087.63,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1094.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390492804,"comment":null},{"amount":408.33,"local_amount":1130.78,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1137.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399740645,"comment":null},{"amount":188.68,"local_amount":522.49,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":525.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410010900,"comment":null},{"amount":453.91,"local_amount":1256.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1264.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419773937,"comment":null},{"amount":294.38,"local_amount":815.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":820.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429423714,"comment":null},{"amount":533.96,"local_amount":1478.66,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1487.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439642303,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-10T15:02:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577406,"name":"Lina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lina (in the photo), age 22, is a garment worker.

He says that he never took a course to learn how to make the ribbons. He learned by practicing every day. His work is very good, and he takes great pains to ensure the girls' ribbons last a long time. Apolonio sells his items in the street markets and goes around to each corner in order to earn a little bit more. He likes dealing with people very much, so he makes an effort to provide very good service. The only difficulty is when the authorities don't let him sell at the street markets; in the majority of the places where he sells, they demand a fee in order to be able to work. Despite this, Apolonio likes to make his notions and to have the necessary tools, but it is also necessary to take some courses to learn to make other accessories. The group is very grateful to VisionFund and Kiva for the opportunity to receive a loan since the three of them can continue investing in their economic activities. Eliud will invest in his mechanic shop and Mar\u00eda will buy corn for selling tortillas.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":573.05,"image":{"id":1379283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy sewing items and raw material to make his ribbons","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san antonio Enchisi, Atlacomulco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apolonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1247.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1424.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1517.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1580.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1676.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1753.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1845.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1953.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":1248,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944848,"comment":null},{"amount":109.63,"local_amount":1425.13,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1438.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227922,"comment":null},{"amount":116.79,"local_amount":1518.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1532.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991767,"comment":null},{"amount":121.62,"local_amount":1581.01,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1595.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644425,"comment":null},{"amount":129.01,"local_amount":1677.08,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877897,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T19:20:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577475,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer is a hardworking entrepreneur who has business buying and selling frozen products in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 26,000 through NWTF to buy additional frozen products like chicken, tapa, corned beef, etc to sell in her frozen products business.\r\n\r\nJennifer has been in this business for five years.

woman, 63 years of age. She is a widow. She has two grown sons and one daughter. Her sons are currently outside Tajikistan; they are migrant workers in Russia. Every month their send some money to support their mother. Mahram\u2019s daughter lives separately with her husband. As to Mahram, she lives in her home together with her daughters-in-law and grandchildren. The grandchildren are growing, and  the expenditures to cover their needs are increasing too. Even though Mahram's sons send some money, this is not enough to provide for all family needs. Therefore Mahram runs her own small business. She buys and resells fruits and vegetables. Mahram gets up early in the morning and buys vegetables or fruits at the wholesale market and then resells them at the central market of their region. She puts some of the money aside and spend the rest to buy food for her family. Her two daughters-in-law do not remain idle, either: one of them sews custom-made dresses, and the other sells homemade noodles to local cafeterias. At present it is the season to make household purchases, which is why the demand for vegetables and fruits is increasing. Therefore Mahram would like to expand her stock and earn larger revenues for her family. Mahram has applied to Arvand for a loan to stock up on various vegetables and fruits. She thanks Arvand for its financial support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":237.08,"image":{"id":1380868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy vegetables and fruits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Rudaki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.133333 68.958333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahram","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":173.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":178.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":184.86},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":190.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":197.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":203.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":210.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":217.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":224.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":231.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":239.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":247.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.39,"local_amount":173.27,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":173.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616152,"comment":null},{"amount":37.58,"local_amount":178.97,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":179.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860023,"comment":null},{"amount":38.82,"local_amount":184.86,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":184.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136770,"comment":null},{"amount":40.1,"local_amount":190.94,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":191.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900966,"comment":null},{"amount":41.41,"local_amount":197.22,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":197.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550148,"comment":null},{"amount":42.78,"local_amount":203.71,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":203.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774369,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T05:10:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577484,"name":"Loel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loel is a widower and blessed with three children.

is a 59 year-old married mother of seven children. For a living, she harvests olive trees, thyme leaves, vine leaves, and many other kinds of plants. Following the harvest, she turns the olives and the leaves into edible products, sells them or conserves them as a \"Mouneh\" (food that is conserved from one season to the other). She has been working in this field for 25 years now. Her husband is a concierge, and three of her underage children work. \r\n\r\nHowever, even with five family members working, the family income is extremely low and is in no way sufficient to provide for a family of 9 individuals. Furthermore, Subhiyi did not have the opportunity as a child or even as an adult to acquire a proper education, because of her economic situation and that of her late parents.

He lives in rural Kagadi. He is a farmer and trader buying mainly maize and beans as his major source of income. He also grows coffee and tomatoes as an additional source of income to look after his family.\r\n\r\nGabriel wants a loan of 1,000,000 Uganda Shillings (UGX) to add into his produce trade business so that he can get more returns from the business this season. It's now the harvest season and yet his income is low; he believes if he invests the money from the loan his returns will be high. His dream is to buy a motor vehicle to ease the transportation of his produce to the market and reduce the cost of hiring, therefore increasing profit.\r\n\r\nHowever, Gabriel is always challenged by the limited capital in his business as well as the price fluctuations for agricultural products on the market. He is a hard working man who is committed to seeing his fellow group members' livelihoods transformed.

Their house is located closer to the town center, and so she can make more sales there.  In the year that she has run her business, do\u00f1a Luisa has earned good customers who come to spend their money because the food and the customer service are good: do\u00f1a Luisa always greets her customers with a smile.  \r\n\r\nA loan from VisionFund will help do\u00f1a Luisa to purchase tortillas, meat, chilies, tomatoes, onions, cooking oil, beans, potatoes, bananas, corn, rice, soup, gas and beverages to make her food to sell. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Luisa hopes that with this investment her business will generate more sales and her earnings will go up.  Little by little, she wants to expand her business and be able to offer her children a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Luisa is one of the members of the communal bank called \"Oportunidad 2\" (Opportunity 2), which is made of up ten people.  It is located in the community of San Miguel Soyaltepec, which is where the Cerro de Oro reservoir is located. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the communal bank are:\r\n\r\nEfigenia- food sales\r\nVictoria- snack sales \r\nFidelina-shoe sales\r\nArely- cosmetics sales\r\nMaria de los \u00e1ngeles- Popsicle sales \r\nAlma Delia- food sales \r\nDaniela- clothing sales\r\nGuillermo- chicken sales \r\nJuana- meat sales"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":1378217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase tortillas, meat, chilies, tomatoes, onion, cooking oil, beans, potatoes, bananas, corn, rice, soup, gas and beverages.

The family is without a source of the income at the moment.\r\n\r\nMkrtich requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Mkrtich has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

She and her husband joined hands to work in the neighbors\u2019 banana plantations to earn a living until they managed to plant their own banana garden. That is when she got to know of Ugafode micro finance and acquired a loan of 500,000 which helped her buy another piece of land to expand their banana plantation.

She began her business because she needs to create her own source of income instead of depending on her husband alone. She works at the business eight hours per day and six days per week.  She says that the main challenge to her business is transporting the fish.  It is very difficult because sometimes the vehicle breaks on the way.  \r\n\r\nMarie requires a loan in order to purchase more fish for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Marie plans to expand her business even more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":149.48,"image":{"id":1379821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

For the past three years she has been operating a table where she sells pigs feet and cow meat in the local market. She started this business with money given to her by her fiance who sells charcoal. She enjoys her business because the business gives her more money. She sells six days a week, from 7 am to 5 pm, and most of the time she uses a bus to get her goods to her table. She is requesting a loan to purchase more pigs feet and cow meat for her business.

is 58 years old. He lives in the Kutaisi district with his 32-year-old son, Shalva, and his daughter-in-law. Ramaz requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Shalva is working as a singer at the local restaurant. His wife is a cook. They both get small monthly salaries that are the only source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Ramaz will start trading in household goods and clothes. He will go to Turkey to purchase everything at wholesale prices, bring it to his district, and sell among the villagers with a price markup. Shalva will work as hard as he can to earn a good profit and provide a better life for his family. He will reinvest part of the profit into the same field to purchase more products and offer better choices to his clients. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Surayo's husband is a welder, and he makes little money.  Surayo herself raises cattle.  Her husband assists her with the purchase and sale of cattle. This business provides them with a good profit.

Surayo decided to turn to the  Avrand organization and request a loan application.  She wants to buy more cattle and increase her herd, and then re-sell the cattle she has fattened up in autumn and begin to repair her home.

Musalam sells children's clothing, and she has a store which she leased herself at one of the markets in town.  She loves children very much, and therefore decided to sell children's clothing.  Earlier, she had her merchandise delivered by vendors, which was more expensive.  She has now decided to go and purchase the merchandise herself.  Musalam dreams that her children receive a good education and work in a professional field in the future.  She hopes that, in her old age, her children can be her support.  Because Musalam has decided to start traveling by herself to purchase merchandise, she needs the financial means to do so. She learned from her friends that she can request a loan from the Avrand organization, and has decided to submit an application.  This is her first loan from Avrand and, because of this, she is very serious about receiving a loan.  She plans to use the loan to purchase a new assortment of children's summer clothing, and expand her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1375865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy children's clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T23:00:04Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Musalam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":344.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":356.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":368.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":380.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":393.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":407.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":420.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":435.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":449.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":465.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":480.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":497.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.36,"local_amount":344.58,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":344.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616153,"comment":null},{"amount":74.82,"local_amount":356.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":356.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860024,"comment":null},{"amount":77.35,"local_amount":368.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":368.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136771,"comment":null},{"amount":79.97,"local_amount":380.83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":381.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900967,"comment":null},{"amount":82.69,"local_amount":393.74,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":393.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550149,"comment":null},{"amount":662.81,"local_amount":3156.25,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3157.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774370,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-30T21:46:18Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":578257,"name":"Jose Amilcar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 de 36 a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su esposa y sus dos hijos; el se dedica a la agricultura espec\u00edficamente al cultivo de ma\u00edz, y cafe  tiene muchos a\u00f1os de trabajar en este rubro y se ha hecho de experiencia muy valiosa que le permite obtener las mejores cosechas , el terreno de cultivo est\u00e1 ubicado en una zona de incidencia agr\u00edcola, el comercia en todas las zonas aleda\u00f1as y ya tiene mucha clientela fija, estas personas siempre prefieren su producto pues es de calidad y a precios realmente accesibles adem\u00e1s el servicio es inigualable, Jos\u00e9 necesita invertir en insumos pero no posee de suficiente capital por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar semillas, abono, insecticida, fertilizantes, herramienta, etc. y asi seguir con sus cosechas y poder darle a su familia lo que necesita in limitaci\u00f3n alguna.","en":"Jos\u00e9, 36, lives with his wife and their two children.

27-year-old Zainab from Moriba town in Sierra Leone. She is married with two children between aged two and seven years-old. One of her children is currently attending school. In 2008, Zainab established her fish business. She began her business because she wanted to be self dependent. She works at the business eight hours per day and six days per week.  She says that the main challenge to her business is transporting the fish which is very difficult because sometimes vehicles break on the way.  \r\n\r\nZainab requires a loan in order to purchase more fish for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her standard of living. In the future, Zainab plans to expand her business more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":105.98,"image":{"id":1379872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Good roads, access to clean water, affordable rents, and plentiful transportation options make Paynesville South one of the most popular places to live. \r\n\r\nCecelia is single, with two children, ages 11 and four. Her children are currently attending school and live at home. \r\n\r\nShe runs a table business, selling used clothes, such as blouses, tee-shirts, and trousers.  She describes herself as serious businesswoman. \r\n\r\nCecelia started her business two years ago, using money given to her mother. Typically, she works at her business from 7am to 4pm, Monday to Saturday, and she transports her goods to her business by bus. She cites her greatest challenge as small capital. She is proud of her business because it supports her home.\r\n\r\nUsing the proceeds of this loan, Cecelia intends to purchase more used clothes, such as blouses, jeans, trousers, and tee-shirts. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Cecelia plans to build her house and educate her children.

","en":"Zebi is a middle aged woman; she is married and has four children and lives in the Gafurov district. She has worked as a dry-cleaner for over thirty years. Her husband is a farmer; he has land where he grows rice. The family now has seven members: Zebi's two sons and two daughters, the elder daughter's husband, and the wife and child of the eldest son, who works in construction. The younger son is finishing high school this year. \r\n\r\nZebi has a large house, and she would like to do some repairs, since upkeep hasn't been done in a very long time.

","en":"Zulfiniso is a happy mother to two wonderful children. She is divorced - unfortunately, several years ago, her husband divorced her and left her alone with two children.  It was very difficult for Zulfiniso to raise her children by herself, but she tried to do everything to become both their father and their mother, so that her children would not feel the absence of a father.  Of course, Zulfiniso herself feels lonely and abandoned, but she tries not to let her children know this.  Her children are very caring and help their mother.  Zulfiniso works in one of the restaurants in her town. She is a cook, and prepares very delicious and exceptional dishes. Zulfiniso is a very responsible and good worker, and she is loved and valued as a good and professional chef. She likes her job very much and she has achieved a lot in three years.  Now, Zulfiniso plans to repair her house, because it has been a long time since it was repaired.\r\nHer home is in very poor condition, and is in need of renovation. With this goal, Zulfiniso has turned to Avrand in order to receive a loan to purchase building

","en":"Gulandom is a married woman who has three children. She is a vendor who sells vegetables and fruits. She has a small stall near her home where she sells vegetables and fruits.  She has engaged in this trade for several years now. Her husband also works. Gulandom is a very diligent woman, who is prepared to work seven days a week for her children.  In the morning, she goes to the market, purchases fresh fruits and vegetables, and sells them until evening.  Earlier, her daughter used to help her, but she got married and her husband sometimes helps after work. Recently, her son became ill, and his treatment and medication require a certain amount of money.  Therefore, she and her husband have decided to take out a loan.  They also want to remodel their home a little.  Because of this, they want to spend a portion of the loan on their son's treatment, and use the rest to purchase building materials in order to repair their apartment, because it has been a long time since they have repaired it. Gulandom thanks Avrand in advance for the

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":62.5,"image":{"id":1380036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T01:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T01:10:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-26T08:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":994.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390668179,"comment":null},{"amount":10.41,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":994.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400621695,"comment":null},{"amount":10.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":994.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410196578,"comment":null},{"amount":10.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":994.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419960027,"comment":null},{"amount":10.41,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":994.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429613920,"comment":null},{"amount":10.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":994.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-01T02:08:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577728,"name":"Tenneh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tenneh is 49 years old and lives in Compound #3.

is 29 years old. She is married and has one child, aged 12. In 2005, she established her grocery store business. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW, and used her most recent to buy grocery goods for her business. In the future, Babita plans to uplift the economic conditions of her family.  She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.

It was formed three years ago and has provided valuable opportunities for the ten women to access loans and education through Friendship Bridge. The women were able to either start, maintain or grow various businesses such as animal husbandry, retail sales (snacks, typical clothing) or weaving. In this way, they generate income to support their families.\r\n\r\nTwo of the members of the Trust Bank are new and one of them is 41-year-old Eufemia. She is widowed with four children. Before her husband died four years ago, Eufemia depended on him to provide financial support for the family. After his death, she needed to find a way to support herself and her children, two of whom are in school. She began to raise chickens and soon realized that her business could prosper with more investment. Eufemia learned of Friendship Bridge, attended meetings and requested her first loan! Currently, she has one dozen chickens that she sells in the local market. With her loan, Eufemia intends to purchase three dozen additional chickens as well as feed to fatten them. This industrious woman also is involved with textile design which is an additional way for her to generate income.\r\n\r\nEufemia is very confident that her business will prosper.

She has two children, and she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNeda operates a rug making business. She mainly offers rugs - from those round, palm sized ones to the much larger doormats - and other crafts that most rug makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 13,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. \r\n\r\nNeda hopes to expand her business and have more. She dreams that her children will finish their studies.

It is a community of some 30 houses located on the edge of a road where the majority of the inhabitants make their living in agriculture, through the goodness of the earth. \r\n\r\nAna Zulema was raised on a modest farm where she learned agricultural work from an early age. However, she also studied to be a teacher because she likes teaching reading and writing to children. Since that time more than 20 years ago, she has been offering classes to children in her community's small schoolhouse. On weekends she, her husband, and their four children engage in agricultural labor on their farm, which she inherited from her parents and where they harvest corn and beans. \r\n\r\nThrough some of her friends at work, she learned about the Kiva lenders who finance loans for poor people through CEPRODEL.

Martina and Phil are looking after the program and overall management of The Oyster Ltd.  A community outreach to the people is perfectly taken care of by Dickson. On the ground, people like Betty are working as \u201cBasic Energy Entrepreneurs\u201d on the promotion of the products to the local communities.They facilitate the saving and collection of money, do refresher trainings if a user has questions on the products, as well as make small repairs in case of simple issues, or facilitate the contact between the community customer and our office if need be. In return, they gain not only respect from their communities, but also a commission on top of their subsistence farming and small business activities. \r\n\r\n\"We can keep the end-customer prices low through the bigger quantity of solar lamps imported at one time, which is necessary for many families to be able to afford the lights. It will also ease our distribution to more remote entrepreneurs who normally keep stocks longer, as they have to wait for their customers to save up the money.\r\n\r\nWe have been field-testing a broad range of micro-solar devices from many manufacturers and countries, and we found the acceptance and quality-price ratio of the Barefoot Power products are comparatively good. People like the systems, and since we started the test marketing about two years ago, we have not had many issues with these products. \r\n\r\nThe manufacturer warranty on all products is very important to us, as we want people to not spend the little money they have on unsustainable things. Also, Barefoot Power brings in their staff to Malawi from time to time to support our team and entrepreneurs with repair and sales trainings.\r\n\r\nSeveral years of baseline research in Malawian villages and towns has given us a good feeling for the impacts of energy poverty and on how much time and money people spend on sourcing energy for lighting and phone charging. The sources they use, paraffin and one-way batteries as well as car batteries stations for phone charging, are burdening their already low household incomes a lot in the long-run, apart from carrying health risks and being environmentally unsound. Micro-solar products help people to resolve these issues at once, and are making them long-term independent and improve their lives.\r\n\t\r\nWhen people buy our micro-solar systems, we also give them a sheet on which they can calculate their monthly savings from using it, and we get encouraging feedback from many. We even find that after a year has passed from a village demonstration, people still find their way to our outlet because they have seen their neighbours using one of our solar kits and have saved up all the time to finally have one, too. \r\n\r\nSchool children mention that they are not coughing anymore and have better results in school because they have more time to study and spend less time running to charge devices. Business people can open their shops longer and raise their income. And quite a few of our community-based entrepreneurs have become well respected agents of change in their community. The additional income helps them to improve their livelihoods decisively and help to cover those things which are normally hard to cater to, like paying school fees for the children to attend secondary school, maintaining the house in the rainy season and buying fertilizer for the maize field.\r\n\r\nWe are striving to increase the number of energy entrepreneurs by at least 30 this year, and have greater awareness across more communities in Malawi that high-quality micro-solar products are available and where people can find them. In this way, our entrepreneurs can also increase their turnovers and income while bringing more healthy lights into more families.\r\n\r\nWe are also currently trying to establish a revolving fund for a lease-&-buy program, which would allow very low-income households to first rent the lamps from their local entrepreneur and recharge them with him\/her, and later purchase the system. This way, people can benefit from the lights earlier and use the money otherwise spent on paraffin or batteries to repay the cost of the system, instead of having to save that up from an extra budget. \r\n\r\nThe entrepreneurs would also be rewarded by this through earning additional recurring service fee revenue and could involve other people in his or her business, as well as reach out to more customers, even those who could normally not dream of having a nice lamp.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":49975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1379668,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2867,"youtubeId":"kgADMEqos0g","title":"Kiva Borrower Martina from Malawi","thumbnailImageId":1379668},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy and sell Barefoot Power's solar lighting products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"Blantyre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T03:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T03:40:03Z","loan_amount":49975,"lender_count":1643,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":49975,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":49975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34975}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T19:37:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":578274,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el cliente se dedica a la agricultura desde hace 6 a\u00f1os y eso le ha dado la capacidad y el conocimiento necesario para asistir sus cultivos, su principal siembra es el ma\u00edz y el frijol, comercializa sus cultivos en agencias de compra-venta de granos b\u00e1sicos que est\u00e1n cerca de su lugar de residencia, con las ganancias que obtiene de sus ventas ayuda en los gastos que su familia tiene, vive en casa propia con su padre quien tambi\u00e9n le ayuda a trabajar en la agricultura, cuando pasa la temporada agr\u00edcola el cliente se dedica a trabajar de jornalero en una finca cerca de su casa, el cliente esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar insumos agr\u00edcolas que le ayuden en la siembra de sus cultivos como: abonos, semillas, fertilizantes, etc. y mejorar el terreno donde desea hacer su siembra que es el que muestra la fotograf\u00eda  y asi poder tener mejores ganancias y seguir ayudando en los gastos de su casa sin ninguna limitaci\u00f3n.","en":"This client has made his living in agriculture for the last six years.

Her husband is helping her in this business. She earns a daily net income of 400 INR from the existing businesses. Out of this income, she has been able to manage her household expenses in a decent manner. So Mamata is planning to increase her income by expanding the business. Looking into the demand of the locality, with the present loan, Mamata wants to put another two units of machine in her center. One is for processing flattened rice and another is for wheat flour. She is convinced that this will generate a handsome income for her. Mamata hopes to save enough money to provide a better education for her children and construct another hall for the new machines.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Sabutri and Sushila who have a general store business, Laxmi who has a Tiffin center with a fast food center, Gayatree who has a tailoring center and Pausa who has a barber shop businesses, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1380071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase machinery for flattened rice and wheat flour milling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"DAKULUGUDA, RAYAGADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":2975,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabutri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gayatree","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pausa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":176000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":176000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T21:36:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577920,"name":"Robila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robila is a 26-year-old married woman.

She is 31 years of age and lives in a rented house with her husband and two sons who are nine and seven years old. Ten years ago, Sandhyarani\u2019s husband migrated to this place from the coastal belt and worked in a barber shop as a daily wage earner for three years. In the year 2007, Sandhyarani started a one-seat barber shop of her own in a low profile with the help of her husband. In the subsequent years, with three consecutive loans from Mahashakti Foundation, she developed her shop into three seats by taking a rented cabin in the heart of the town. She has engaged two male workers for giving service to the customers. She earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR from her barber shop, which is not at all sufficient to manage the household expenses, the education expenses of her children and the regular expenses for the business. As she is an outsider to this place, she doesn\u2019t have her own house to live. Therefore, Sandhyarani want to increase her income by adding some extra facility to the existing business for generating the minimum necessities of her family. This is the fourth loan of Sandhyarani and she wants to purchase a facial machine, a massage machine and two big mirrors. She also wants to repair the existing moving chairs. From this investment, she expects a good return for the total development of her family. With the extra income, Sandhyarani hopes to purchase a plot of land and construct a house for her family. She also dreams of giving a better education to her children.

borrower is a single mother of two children, one of whom is below the age of fifteen. She lives in a two-room apartment in Bamenda in the Northwest Region of Cameroon. She has faced some difficulties in life, including sickness and the loss of family members such as her father and mother. Poverty in the general family has also been a problem, and starting up a business was not possible.\r\n\r\nShe plans to buy two-week-old fowls, as well as feed and the necessary vaccine for the fowls. Part of the loan will be invested in buying provision items such as tinned tomatoes, Maggi, oil, and rice. She believes that her business will succeed because she has been selling and keeping fowls for a long time. The high demand for fowls and manure in the community is another reason for the success of her business. The community will benefit from the supply of fowls, and the manure will also be sold to the public. They will not have to go a long distance to buy provision items. \r\n\r\nThe profits will help her improve the housing conditions of the family and provide better education and health for her and her only child. She will also expand her business. She prefers GHAPE because of the convenient repayment period, low interest, and the social education they
