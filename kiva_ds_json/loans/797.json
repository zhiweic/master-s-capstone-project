In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also operates a small barber shop for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 14,000 loan.

Costa Rica, in the province of Puntarenas, Golfito, Pavones in the south of the country. It is known for being an area of the country with low rates of human development and compared to other areas of the country it has the most unfavorable rates of education and pay. Therefore one of the alternatives for these women is to develop their own sources of self-employment. This business began with a tip that Shirley received when she worked as a waitress in the restaurant of a hotel in Golfito. It was in that job that she began to sell mail order merchandise such as clothes and cosmetics.

She is a widow with three children, the youngest of whom is still of preschool age. Kairykul worked as a math teacher in secondary school for a long time, but after her husband\u2019s death in 2008, searching for an income source for her family, she launched her livestock business, with a starting capital of 25,000 KGS. Thanks to Kairykul\u2019s hard work, her farm, which now counts three calves and a cow, brings in about 13,000 KGS a month from the sales of milk as well as dairy and meat products.

At the end of each month, they repay the loan, using their monthly salaries. Their bursar is directly responsible for making the repayment on their behalf.<p>\r\n\r\nThe leader of this group of teachers is Kemoh. Born in Kailahun, located in Eastern Sierra Leone, the 54-year-old is married to a teacher, and the couple has four children, one in primary school, one in secondary, and two in college.

This group of teachers has come to Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org, to apply for a loan.

The income from selling the harvest was spent to cover their household and the educational expenses. \r\n\r\nSofia plans to cultivate more plants; she needs more capital to do so. She heard that TLM provides loan assistance; Sofia then submitted a loan application and requested a loan of IDR 4,000,000 to purchase seedlings, pesticide and fertilizer as well. She is hoping that TLM will approve the application so she will be able to improve her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1013604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

","en":"Lira is 54 yeas old and married. Lira worked for many years as an elementary school teacher in the village of Khan-Burgo, and she is now retired. Seeking a source of income for her family, Lira started her own animal husbandry business ten years ago by purchasing one dairy cow. Thanks to her hard work, Lira's business now numbers two cows, one calf, one mare, and 15 sheep. Lira also farms two hectares of irrigated land, where she grows beans and potatoes. In order to further expand her business, Lira requested a loan of 70,000 soms (KGS) from the Bai Tushum & Partners Company to purchase livestock.

She is married to a businessman and has 2 children, aged 19 and 17 years.  They are both in school.  In 2004, Ejartu established her skirt, party dress, and under wear business. She began her business because her parents were against girl child education and at  6 years she was given to foster parents who likewise had no respect for female education.  They were mainly engaged in business.  After Ejartu was fully mature, she was handed in marriage to a businessman.  Her husband gave her some money to start her own business.  She now enjoys doing business and she has almost solved all her problems. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,145,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000.   Ejartu has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans.  Now she would like a new loan in order to purchase the following items: skirts - 2 bales @ Le1,450,000, party dresses - 1 bale @ Le1,100,000, and under vests - 10 dozen @ Le50,000. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 429,000.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ejartu plans to build a house, educate her children to university level, which opportunity she did not have, and have a shop on her own.  She feels happy about taking this loan because it will help her business to grow.  Her major challenge is sometimes she buys a bale that contains spoiled clothing.  She serves 15 customers each day.  Her business is popular because she sells quality used clothing.  She is only assisted by her children.  Her suppliers are in Freetown and she transports her goods by public vehicle.  She buys twice in a month.  She uses the profit of the business to repay her loan.  She wants her business to expand and this will be accomplished by proper utilization of her capital. She is hard working and honest.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1013799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy skirts, party dresses and under vests -","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T03:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T03:00:08Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ejartu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974908,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815470,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444524,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537234,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284702,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338256,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354646,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315575722,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T14:23:49Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:11:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396862,"name":"Pelar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pelar lives in Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

This situation means that in the face of the difficulty of finding a paying job, the women need to become their own employers. In the case of Irma, she had already participated in her first loan cycle at a Banco Mujer. Upon moving to Jalaca, she continued with this business, but it presented the drawback that, given the limitations of her capital, she was not able to construct a farrowing pen, which is a space inside the pigsty where they put the recently born little pigs once they are being fed by the mother pig, because the little pigs can't be in the space with the mother pig all day because they run the risk of being crushed by their own mother, as has already happened. Thus there is an urgent need to do this construction, as well as to have growth feed concentrate, since at this time she has sixteen little pigs that need this food to be able to achieve adequate growth. At the same time, they need vaccines to protect them from diseases.\r\n\r\nThe goal that Irma Rosa has set for herself is to be able to have three sows, so that in this way she can be taking some thirty little pigs to sell every six months, which will permit her to make the monthly loan payments, capitalize her business, and be able to help support her household."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1010803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to construct a farrowing pen and buy pigs, feed concentrate, and vaccines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Corredores","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T04:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T04:10:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":226586.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":249244.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":274169.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":453.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":498.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":548.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":454,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":230632,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301396814,"comment":null},{"amount":1046,"local_amount":523000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":531368,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347072958,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T12:42:20Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:10:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394959,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisco es socio del Banco Comunal El Trebol, tiene 52 a\u00f1os y tiene 7 hijos que viven con \u00e9l.

She has been operating this farm business for 14 years. 60,000 hrivnas has been invested in the business. Annual expenditures on seeds and tape come to 29,000 hrivnas. Svetlana needs an additional 20,000 hrivnas to construct a greenhouse, purchase seeds and plastic film, and to prepare for the coming growing season. Svetlana has long dreamed of erecting an additional greenhouse, but she hasn't been able to find the funds for doing this. This year Svetlana purchased new arches for the new greenhouse. But now she needs money for installing them. Svetlana is divorced, and lives alone. But she is accustomed to doing everything herself. Right now she is building a new house, has installed gas in it, and recently purchased some land at the edge of the village, and plans to put up two more greenhouses eventually."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1015217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to erect a greenhouse, puchase seeds and plastic film and prepare for the coming growing season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Blagoveschenka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svetlana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2500,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-08T08:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":20015,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287518694,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T21:14:02Z","paid_date":"2012-08-08T08:26:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394223,"name":"Llapallanchis Purisunchis Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLLAPALLANCHIS PURISUNCHIS\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de San Jeronimo, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco. \n\n\nLa socia Sra.

is Normita, fifty-three, resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Antonio, a vendor, and mother of three children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNormita operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is to buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them with a small profit. Her products are clothes, sandals, bags and other such-like products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNormita hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1014526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for merchandise and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Normita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2424.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275662,"comment":null},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4848.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998023,"comment":null},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4848.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606563,"comment":null},{"amount":113.34,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4848.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095420,"comment":null},{"amount":28.33,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T01:51:02Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396921,"name":"Gaudiosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gaudiosa is forty-one years old and lives in the Philippines.

is a 25-year-old single man who is living with his mother and a 5-year-old nephew. After graduating from high school seven years ago he decided to initiate a kiosk business. As the only son, Yakob is responsible for helping his mother generate income for their daily needs. He spent his own money to buy kiosk stocks. He sells daily-use basic items e.g., instant noodle, biscuits, sugar, coffee, shampoo, etc. \r\n\r\nLately, Yakob is thinking of adding stock to his kiosk such as cigarettes, instant noodles, snacks, cooking oil, etc. as the more goods he sells then the more income he can earn.  He needs capital assistance to do so. \r\n\r\nHe met a loan officer and received some information on the individual lending program provided by TLM. He then was interested in joining the program and requested a loan of 4,000,000 Rupiah (IDR). Yakob is hoping that TLM will approve his loan application soon.

She is married to Rudy, her business partner, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nMaria Luisa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Luisa hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

is 33-year-old Zainab. She is married to a driver and has 2 children aged 6 years and 8 months old. She has no additional dependents.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Zainab established her Maggi (a product for enhancing the flavour of soups and stews), rood season, and cooking oil business. She began her business because her husband, who was supporting the home strongly, was relieved of his job. She was so dependent on him for survival as she didn't learn a trade, so as a result, she went to her elder brother who advised her to go in to business. Her brother gave her some capital to start the business so that she can also be supportive of her husband. Since then, she worked hard to improve on her capital up to this time. Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000.
