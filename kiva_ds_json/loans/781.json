and has two sons.  His wife helps out with the household.  Shamsiddin is involved in growing agricultural crops and fattening up livestock.  The leftovers from grown crops go toward feeding the livestock.

She has 7 children, 4 of whom are in school now.  She operates a corner store.  She started the business with only a few products and very little capital, but she's managed to keep it going for 7 years.  She and her husband, a farmer, rely on each other to cover their family's expenses.\r\n\r\nSra. Fabiana is a member of a community bank.  She is applying for a loan to stock her store with products--bottled water, juices, snacks, dairy products, sugar, etc.--that she will resell.

Faysuli desde muy temprana edad empez\u00f3 a mostrar que era una persona llena de ideas que quer\u00eda formar una empresa y generar unos ingresos para su hogar. Actualmente, Faysuli se dedica a la producci\u00f3n y venta de bolis (congelada), actividad que emprendi\u00f3 ella sola y que aprendi\u00f3 gracias a que trabajaba en una empresa que se dedicaba a esta actividad, pero su trabajo era muy mal remunerado por lo que decidi\u00f3 empezar con su propio negocio. \nFaysuli actualmente tiene muy buenas ventas en su negocio gracias a que sus productos son de muy buena calidad y su servicio siempre es el mejor. Sin embargo, Faysuli presenta un inconveniente a la hora de producir sus productos, pues toda la producci\u00f3n la hace manual y sus herramientas no son las mejores, lo que hace que no pueda atender pedidos muy grandes ni tampoco pueda automatizar los procesos.

From a very early age, Faysuli began to demonstrate that she was a person full of ideas, who wanted to form a company and generate some income for her home. At present, Faysuli is producing and selling 'bolis' (frozen pops), an activity she began on her own and learned, thanks to working in an enterprise that did this. Her work was very poorly remunerated and she decided to start her own business. \r\n\r\nAt present, Faysuli's business enjoys good sales, thanks to the fact that her products are of very good quality and her service is always the best. Nevertheless, Faysuli faces inconvenience when producing her products because the work is done manually and her equipment is not the best.

In this manner, he has been able to provide his son with access to education and a good quality of life for he and his wife.  \r\n\r\nJorge now has orders from various customers from the sale of cattle, for which he needs to buy some calves to raise them and later sell them at a good price.  However, in reality, Jorge currently does not have enough capital to purchase this livestock.  For this reason, he hopes that a loan will allow him to purchase the cattle and be able to sell them, so that he can continue earning enough income to support the expenses of his home.  \r\n\r\nJorge has a big dream, that one day, he might be able to have his own house, where he, his wife, and his son might live with dignity in a private dwelling.  For this dream, Jorge always works hard to earn the income necessary to achieve this dream.

motivan para que todos los d\u00edas trabaje fuertemente en su taller.\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio desde hace 39 a\u00f1os se dedica a la fabricaci\u00f3n de calzado, y gracias a esto genera los ingresos necesarios para sostener los gastos de su hogar. Jos\u00e9 Arcadio tiene un taller de fabricaci\u00f3n de calzado en el que tiene muy buenas ventas, gran parte de esto debido a la buena calidad de sus productos y a su buena atenci\u00f3n a los clientes.\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio ha visto como se han aumentado sus ventas, por lo que tiene grandes pedidos de sus clientes por entregar. Debido a esto requiere comprar materiales e insumos para la fabricaci\u00f3n del calzado, como lo es el caucho, el pegante, entre otros; sin embargo, Jos\u00e9 Arcadio no cuenta con el capital suficiente para poder afrontar estas compras, por lo que tiene la esperanza de que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita acceder a la compra de los materiales necesarios para la fabricaci\u00f3n del calzado como los son el caucho, el pegante, el cuero, entre otros, y poder as\u00ed cumplirle a sus clientes sin tener que ver afectado sus ingresos mensuales.\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio tiene el gran sue\u00f1o de que sus hijos puedan acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad, y que en un futuro tengan la posibilidad de estudiar una carrera universitaria. Adem\u00e1s, Jos\u00e9 Arcadio sue\u00f1a con que su taller pueda crecer y se consolide, de modo que genere grandes ingresos de los cuales sus hijos puedan obtener una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica en un futuro.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 Arcadio is known as someone who has dedicated his life to his home and children.  He also has a very good reputation for being a hard worker.  He was abandoned by the mother of his children and so cares for the three who are his motivation for working so hard every day in his workshop.\r\n\r\nFor 39 years he has been making shoes and using the income to cover household expenses.  Jos\u00e9 Arcadio's shop has a very high sales volume because of the quality of his products and good customer service.  Since sales volume has increased he has large orders to fill and needs to buy materials and supplies to make shoes, such as rubber and glue, among other things.  But Jos\u00e9 Arcadio does not have enough capital to take on this purchase and he is hoping a loan will help him buy everything he needs such as rubber, glue, leather, etc., so he can fill customer orders without this affecting his monthly income.\r\n\r\nHis dream is for his children to receive a good education so they can go on to get a university degree.  He also wants to expand his workshop and turn it into a stable business that generates a good income for his children's economic stability in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":988571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy materials and supplies to make shoes, such as rubber, leather, glue and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-02T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-03T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Arcadio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71182},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":73190},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75255},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77377},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79560},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":81805},{"due_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84112},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":86485},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88925},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":91433},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":94012},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":96664}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.15,"local_amount":71182,"processed_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":71409.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362236,"comment":null},{"amount":40.47,"local_amount":73584,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":73819.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075531,"comment":null},{"amount":218.74,"local_amount":397715,"processed_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":398987.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432692,"comment":null},{"amount":146.77,"local_amount":266843,"processed_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":267696.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029213,"comment":null},{"amount":104.87,"local_amount":190676,"processed_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":191286.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339547911,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-28T05:30:34Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T16:18:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":386192,"name":"Mbithe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mbithe is 51 years old and married with four children.

That is why Ivan works hard everyday to generate income for his home, where he lives with his mother and son. \r\n\r\nIvan works making clothing for people. He has done this for approximately 13 years. Thanks to this, Ivan obtains enough income to offer his mother and his son everything they need.\r\n\r\nAt present, Ivan has very good orders from his customers. Nonetheless, he has had to turn some down because he doesn't have enough machines to do the jobs. That is why Ivan intends to buy an overlocking sewing machine because it will allow him to fill those orders that he has had to turn down. Nonetheless, Ivan doesn't have enough capital to buy a machine, so he hopes that a loan will offer him the possibility of being able to buy the overlocking sewing machine, so that he won't have to turn down customers' orders that need that machine. \r\n\r\nIvan dreams of his business generating more income, allowing him to give his mother and son a better quality of life. In addition, Ivan dreams of his son being able to access a university education and thus be prepared to have a well paid job in the future.

She is married and the mother of 3 children aged between 2 and 10. She is a small retailer and has been selling peanut butter for 5 years. She chose this work so that she could stay busy.

personas.\nRodil ha sido desde muy peque\u00f1o un buen trabajador, y se ha desempe\u00f1ado en diferentes actividades. Gracias a un amigo que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 la labor, Rodil ahora trabaja en la metalister\u00eda, actividad que le permite generar los ingresos necesarios para el sostenimiento de su hogar, donde convive con su esposa. \nRodil ha trabajado durante mucho tiempo como ayudante en un taller de metalister\u00eda, pero un d\u00eda decidi\u00f3 independizarse y mont\u00f3 su propio taller. \nDesde entonces Rodil tiene su taller de metalister\u00eda donde tiene muy buenos clientes debido a su buen servicio y a la buena calidad que ofrece, y donde tiene muy buenos pedidos para realizar trabajos a sus clientes.\nActualmente Rodil tiene buenos pedidos de sus clientes, sin embargo, debido a que no posee la infraestructura completa para ofrecer el servicio completo a sus clientes, Rodil ve como no pueda contratar con sus clientes la fabricaci\u00f3n de algunos productos. Es por esto que Rodil pretende acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina rectificadora de cilindros que le permita tener los contratos de sus clientes, sin embargo, la m\u00e1quina es muy costosa y Rodil apenas cuenta con aproximadamente el 60% de su valor. Por esto, Rodil tiene la esperanza de que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita acceder a la compra de la m\u00e1quina rectificadora de cilindros y de esta manera pueda seguir teniendo todos los contratos con sus clientes.\nRodil sue\u00f1a con que su negocio le genere grandes ingresos, de modo que le pueda mejorar la condici\u00f3n de vida que tiene su esposa actualmente, y tambi\u00e9n quiere que sus padres puedan obtener una mejor calidad de vida. \nAdicional a esto, Rodil sue\u00f1a con tener su propia casa, donde pueda tener mayor privacidad con su esposa, y puedan tener una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"Rodil is a very charismatic person who his family feels is always trying to help others.  Since he was very young he has always been a hard worker in different business activities.  Thanks to a friend who taught him the trade, Rodil now is involved in metalworks which allows him to generate enough income to cover household expenses for himself and his wife.\r\n\r\nFor many years he worked as a metal workshop assistant but decided to become independent and set up his own workshop.  Since then Rodil has been running his metal business and gaining many customers because of his quality work and customer service.  He receives many orders.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Rodil has many orders but does not have the infrastructure he would need to fill them, nor the resources to outsource the jobs.  So he wants to buy a cilinder grinding machine to attend to customer contracts.  The machine is very expensive and Rodil can barely cover 60% of the cost.  Therefore he is hoping to obtain a loan to buy the machine and fill customer orders.\r\n\r\nRodil's goal is for his business to generate a good income so he and his wife can have a better lifestyle.  He also wants his parents to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nAlso, Rodil hopes to have his own house so he and his wife can have more privacy.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":990543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal

However Miguel Angel does not have sufficient capital to purchase these supplies, since his customers pay him only after all the merchandise has been delivered. Thus he hopes a loan will allow him the possibility of purchasing the supplies for his shop, such as rubber, glue and soles among other items, so as to continue delivering his customers their orders. \r\n\r\nMiguel Angel dreams of having his business be a large workshop with its own brand, and which also would generate many jobs. In addition he dreams that his business would bring him very good income so his parents wouldn't have to work anymore, and that they would have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nMiguel Angel sees for himself a future as a great businessman, very well-known, and which would allow for many possibilities of employment for many persons in need. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":990673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to purchase materials for making footwear including rubber, glue, and soles among other items.

She used to live in a tough neighbourhood where she lost two of her children, one of whom used to help her pay for household expenses. She is a single mother still responsible for her daughter and granddaughter. As she was the only one who could earn a living, she began searching in the streets for any way she could to earn money. She sold a variety of merchandise. Because she is very organised, she saved a large part of her income and with help from a government subsidy, she managed to buy a house at a good price.\r\n\r\nCurrently Maria Ofelia runs a store out of her house where she sells basic, everyday items.
