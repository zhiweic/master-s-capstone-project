He is pictured with 24 One Acre Fund farmers, 12 women and 12 men. Douglas is standing on the right with his hand raised. He is receiving an input loan for \u00bd acre of sweet potato, millet, and sorghum cultivation. Douglas first enrolled with the One Acre Fund during the 2011 Long Rains and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. Douglas joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nDouglas described his harvest as excellent last year as a One Acre Fund farmer and hopes for another good year in the 2013 Long Rains season.

She lives in Etseri village, Terjola district with her husband Gaga, and is mother to an infant, Tamar. Marekhi requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main income for the family is from agricultural activities. They have a milk cow, a plot of agricultural land and a vineyard. The cow is milked to make dairy products. On the land they grow wheat, and the harvested product are sold locally at the markets along with the dairy products. In addition, Gaga is working on construction projects for private orders as an artisan and gets small monthly income.  \r\n\r\nMarekhi requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Marekhi will start trading in fruits and vegetables.

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is single with six children and three of them attend school. She also looks after her sister. She has been selling small yellow bananas in the market for fifteen years, working six days a week. She also sells water as another source of income. \r\nShe has requested a loan of UGX 800,000 from MCDT-SACCO to enable her to buy more green bananas for sale.

In the city, there is a high unemployment rate, but a farm business helps the family have some stable income.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from their agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard with 400 samples of wine trees and a 1.2 hectare plot of land where different kinds of fruits and vegetables are grown. Shalva cultivates the land and does his best to insure a good harvest. In addition, they have a milking cow and two pigs. Shalva\u2019s wife milks the cow and produces dairy products to sell. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nShalva requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Shalva will purchase a car. After the car is purchased, Shalva plans to serve local people as a taxi driver and earn money.

In addition, they own a plot of land. Valerian cultivates the land and plants maize.

His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Valerian will purchase a car. He wants to start selling pig feed. He will purchase it at the wholesale price and resell it with a price mark up. Breading pigs is very developed in his district so Valerian hopes the feed for pigs will be highly requested by his villagers.

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is married with six children and all of them attend school. She is also looking after her sister.\r\nShe has been selling raw food in the market for two years, working six days a week. She also sells cow peas to earn additional income.\r\nShe has requested a loan of UGX 200,000 from MCDT-SACCO to enable her to purchase more foodstuff like bananas, cassava, sweet and Irish potatoes to sell.

The group has 8 women and 3 men. Ezekiel is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him on credit consisting of the necessary materials to plant \u00bd acre of Sweet Potato, millet and sorghum. Ezekiel first enrolled with One Acre Fund during the 2011 Long Rains and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. Ezekiel joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough food for the family and use increased profits to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nEzekiel described his harvest as very good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year.

He joined this year in order to gain access to the best input prices of hybrid seed and fertilizer.\r\n\r\nAlfred thought his harvest last year was poor. He hopes that as a One Acre Fund farmer he can have an excellent harvest. He plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and repair his home. For the 2013 Long Rains season, Alfred\u2019s group members will take input loans of \u00bd acre each.  In total, this group will receive input loans for use on 5 acres of land.   \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1319065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of sweet potato, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-03-26T13:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-25T13:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luke","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":33000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":34311.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602845,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T01:24:06Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:24:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541599,"name":"Alex","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alex is 26 years old and single; he does not support anyone else.

He is pictured with twelve One Acre Fund farmers: eight women and four men. Zephaniah is standing on the right with his hand raised. Zephaniah joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. He is receiving an input loan for half an acre of sweet potato, millet, and sorghum cultivation. Zephaniah joined One Acre Fund so that he could access the best input prices and grow enough food for his family.\r\n\r\nZephaniah described his harvest as very good last year, but he believes he can have an even better one this year.

With a lot of sacrifice, the oldest of his children attends the university despite the fact that higher education is expensive in his country. He is originally from a municipality situated in the northern part of the department of Chinandega.

She began her business because she needed a permanent income to support the home. She works at the business 9 hours per day and 6 days per week. When there is a crisis of fuel, it leads to her goods being delayed.\r\n\r\nDuba requires a loan in order to buy more local food, like palm oil.

is 31-year-old Nafisatu.  She is married and has two children, aged 8 and 10 years. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Nafisatu established her slippers business. She began her business after she decided to quit her job. Her business is located in the outskirts of the city and her main customers are general community people. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 500,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nNafisatu would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000.

What she doesn't like is that sometimes the customers aren't respectful when they are intoxicated, since unfortunately there are many bars where they sell a lot of liquor in the zone where she works. Nevertheless, she has learned to handle this type of situation, and she always manages to come out victorious. She hopes to get a place where she can sell with greater comfort and where she would mainly have the security that she now lacks. \r\n\r\nAt this time she is applying for 1200 PEN.

que en la foto se encuentra parada al costado derecho de blusa color sandia y pelo negro liso largo. En el Banco Comunal de Las Exitosas hay diversos rubros entre los cuales encontramos venta de ropa nueva y usada, torner\u00eda mec\u00e1nica, perfumes, joyas, panader\u00eda, cremas y maquillaje. La se\u00f1ora Ximena vende ropa, accesorios como cigarreras, adem\u00e1s de cremas reductoras y para el pelo. Hace tres a\u00f1os renuncio a su trabajo y fue el impulso para que  trabajara de manera independiente, en ese tiempo se dedico a vender joyas, maquillaje, masajes reductores, cremas reductoras,  y empez\u00f3 con un capital de solo $20.000, aunque tuvo una buena llegada los problemas fueron apareciendo en el momento de que las clientas le pagaran porque muchas personas le compraban pero no le pagaban de inmediato y al momento en que Ximena les iba a cobrar, ellas ya no trabajaban en ese lugar o simplemente se hab\u00edan cambiado de casa, ese fue un gran problema al principio cuando estaba empezando con su peque\u00f1o negocio, pero eso de todas maneras le ayudo para aprender y as\u00ed fortalecer de a poco su negocio; adem\u00e1s de no tener competencia en su rubro, por lo cual es un negocio seguro ya que, por el tiempo que lleva trabajando, ha podido hacerse de clientas . Ximena nos cuenta que el pr\u00e9stamo lo ocupar\u00e1 para comprar ropa y as\u00ed poder ampliar aun mas su rubro, que tiene que ver con ayudar a que la mujeres se sientan aun m\u00e1s bonitas. Ella espera y tiene todas las ganas de que al momento de recibir su cr\u00e9dito, \u00e9ste le ayude para que sea un buen a\u00f1o y exitoso, adem\u00e1s de estar completamente agradecida con Fondo Esperanza por no solo entregarle ayuda econ\u00f3mica, sino tambi\u00e9n por ser una ayuda integral en donde adem\u00e1s las capacitan y siempre est\u00e1n pendientes de la ayuda que necesiten para poder cumplir sus sue\u00f1os.     ","en":"\"Las Exitosas\" is a communal bank located in the city of Concepci\u00f3n. It is here that we meet Ximena, who, in the photo, is standing on the right, with long, straight dark hair.  In this communal bank there are various types of business, including selling new and used clothing, a machine shop, and members selling perfumes, jewellery, bread, creams and make-up.  Ximena sells clothes and accessories (such as cigar cases) as well as muscle-relaxing creams and hair products.  Ximena quit her job three years ago and was motivated to start working independently.  At the time she made a living selling jewellery, make-up, massages and creams for pain relief.  She started with $20,000 of capital though she had many problems with payments as, while customers were buying her products, they did not pay immediately and when Ximena later went to collect the payments people had changed address.  This was a big problem in the beginning when she was starting out but it still helped her to learn and to strengthen her business little by little.  She also has no competition for her business so it is quite secure and since she has started working she has been able to  attract clients.  Ximena tells us that she will use this loan to buy clothes, thus expanding her business mission which is to do with helping women to feel even more beautiful.  Ximena hopes and really wants that the loan will help her to have a good and successful year.  She is very grateful to \"Fondo Esperanza\" for not just providing financial resources but also for being an important help in providing training.  \"Fondo Esperanza\" is always on the lookout to see how they can help people fulfill their dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4325,"image":{"id":1321874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

He is a hardworking man. He lives with his wife Primitiva and their children in the house he bought 16 years ago. Alejandro is a farmer and he buys and sells animals. He has been doing these activities for more than 30 years. He works very hard with his animals, among them sheep and cows. He cares for them with much dedication and patience, since the meat they produce depends a lot on it. He sells the meat in the market to his regular customers. But farming is the way he saves money. He says that he plants on large plots of land located in a fertile area 2 hours away. His corn, potatoes and other crops bring him good income. He sells them at a good price, drying the corn. Now he wants to improve his crops because it will be May soon and during that month the prices go up. \r\n\r\nAlejandro will invest S\/.3,000 soles to buy organic fertilizer to feed his crops. He is committed to making his payments on time.

She lives with Eliazar, her husband of 20 years, and the couple have two children: Kelvin and Lizbeth.  They care for their children in a house that they inherited 12 years ago.\r\n\r\nWhile Aquilina's husband works as a laborer in a brick factory, where they pay him for every 1,000 bricks he makes, Aquilina's business is buying and selling livestock.  This is where they make the most profit.  Aquilina buys sheep, bulls and cows when they are very young, raises and feeds them, then sells them in the local markets in the city.  She has a lot of experience in this line of work.  She says that she charges a very good price for her animals and, if people don't pay her what she asks, she takes the animals home again, continues feeding them, and puts them up for sale again later so that she can make a good profit.  \"I can't sell my animals for too little.  I have to be smart\", she says.

necesidades de su hogar, es divorciada lo cual fue una crisis muy dif\u00edcil en su vida, pero que supo sobrellevar exitosamente. Tiene 4 hijos que son independientes y tienen su hogar formado bajo los mismos valores que aprendieron con su valiosa madre. Ahora Nancy vive sola en la Parroquia Chig\u00fcilpe a 15 minutos del centro de Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Esta parroquia tiene varias viviendas de cemento y mixtas de madera con cemento. Tiene un r\u00edo que es muy visitado y en donde los turistas y habitantes practican varios deportes y adem\u00e1s tienen la oportunidad de conocer una cultura ts\u00e1chila que suele contar sus leyendas a los visitantes en medio de una fogata y camping. Santo Domingo que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nNancy es una mujer comerciante, ha aprendido del negocio y sus finanzas emp\u00edricamente, pues lleva 10 a\u00f1os vendiendo cosm\u00e9ticos, joyas y ropa de forma ambulante, recorre las largas calles de su ciudad ofreciendo sus productos, tomando pedidos y cobrando las cuentas pendientes de sus clientes. Invierte todo el d\u00eda en esta actividad, saliendo desde tempranas horas en la ma\u00f1ana y volviendo a su hogar un poco despu\u00e9s del atardecer. Nancy solicita un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual podr\u00e1 comprar pantalones de calidad para ofrecerlos a precios c\u00f3modos en el sur de Quinind\u00e9 una zona rural que Nancy ha tenido la oportunidad de visitar para ofrecer sus productos y en la cual identific\u00f3 la demanda de ropa casual principalmente pantalones de este tipo. Es su primer cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y fue muy oportuno por la agilidad, confianza y apertura que prestan a emprendedores y microempresarios que trabajan en busca de la obtenci\u00f3n de sus sue\u00f1os. Nancy sue\u00f1a con tener su negocio propio establecido en la ciudad para evitar el traslado que afecta su salud por el ajetreo y a veces las condiciones clim\u00e1ticas que no se prestan para su recorrido acostumbrado. \nNancy agradece a quienes alrededor del mundo se preocupan por financiar este sue\u00f1o y ser parte del crecimiento de su negocio a trav\u00e9s de Kiva. ","en":"Nancy, 53, has been able to get ahead and cover her family\u2019s needs with her high school education. She got divorced, which was a difficult period of her life, but she has managed to overcome it. Nancy has four independent children that have their own families and kept the values they learned from their mother, a valuable person. \r\n\r\nNancy lives now by herself in a community called Chig\u00fcilpe, 15 minutes away from Santo Domingo\u2019s center. Santo Domingo is the capital city of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province, a region with many commercial activities that has become an important hub for the exchange between the mountains and the coastal areas in Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThe Chig\u00fcilpe community has different houses; some built with cement, some with wood and cement combined. It has a river that is popular with tourists and where people practice different sports. They also have the opportunity to see and learn from the ts\u00e1chila culture, by listening to stories and legends by a bonfire or while camping. Santo Domingo is the third most inhabited city in the region and has other activities such as agriculture, cattle farming, fishing and manufacture.\r\n\r\nNancy is a saleswoman who has learned by doing. She has been selling cosmetics, jewelry and clothes as a street vendor for ten years. She walks the city\u2019s streets offering her products and receiving orders and collecting money from her customers. Nancy works all day, starting early in the morning and coming back home in the evening. She is requesting a loan to buy good-quality pants to sell them south of Quinind\u00e9, a rural area that she has visited and where she identified a good opportunity to sell clothes, especially this type of pants. This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa. The process was fast, thanks to their confidence and open-mindedness with entrepreneurs that work to meet their goals.\r\n\r\nNancy dreams of having her own, fixed establishment in the city. In this way, she does not have to travel and put her health at risk because of the weather and the energy that is required. Nancy wants to thank those who, all over the world, care about financing this dream and that contribute to the growth of her business through Kiva."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":592.47,"image":{"id":1321988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy good-quality pants to sell in rural areas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-27T16:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-26T16:20:14Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":71.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":86.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":88.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":90.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":92.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":93.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":95.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":99.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.07,"local_amount":71.55,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":72.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133247,"comment":null},{"amount":82.39,"local_amount":81.79,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":82.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313786,"comment":null},{"amount":84.59,"local_amount":83.98,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565391,"comment":null},{"amount":85.69,"local_amount":85.06,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":85.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814430,"comment":null},{"amount":87.36,"local_amount":86.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":87.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320602,"comment":null},{"amount":89.51,"local_amount":88.86,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":89.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856292,"comment":null},{"amount":90.86,"local_amount":90.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":90.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059867,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T11:50:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":542969,"name":"Magda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Magda es de la Ciudad de Concepci\u00f3n en donde tiene su negocio, ella es comerciante hace 4 a\u00f1os  cuenta con clientes tanto  en la ciudad de Concepci\u00f3n y alrededores, tambi\u00e9n cuenta con ventas de ropas, mercer\u00eda ,comestibles ,y tiene el servicio de maxi y mini carga como ventas de tarjetas y dem\u00e1s accesorios de celulares entre otros, comenz\u00f3 con venta de comestibles donde con el d\u00eda a d\u00eda fue cargando su local en donde hoy cuenta con buena cantidad de productos para su venta \nDesea que con el tiempo pueda llegar a cumplir su sue\u00f1o de ser due\u00f1a de una casa comercial en donde pueda vender variedades de cosas  por lo que trabaja duro \nSolicita de este cr\u00e9dito para la compra de prendas y tarjetas para poder reponer lo que ya vendi\u00f3.

Khujaqul and his wife work in the \"dekhkan\" farming sector, which is an agricultural system unique to Tajikistan whereby small individual or collective private farms are set up to be worked by a few people, and where the main crops grown are cotton, wheat, or vegetables, accounting for 60% of irrigated land use in the country. Now Khujaqul wants to start his own business in the area of animal husbandry because this field is profitable and does not require a great deal of physical labour. With this aim in mind, he is now seeking a loan for the purchase and sale of cattle.

She lovingly takes care of them in the house they bought six years ago.\r\n\r\nShe has earned her living in agriculture for five years.  Her main crops are peas, potatoes, and beans, which she plants on her own plots of land in the town closest to her home.

He manages a farm with 400 productive cacao trees, and 300 newly planted seedlings \u2013 cacao trees raised in a bag before transplanting. Besides cacao, the family cultivates the traditional Maya package of corn, beans and rice for home use and extra income. Cacao is his favorite crop, says Thomas, because it is both a cash crop and a staple at home. Most Mayan families use some of their cacao for making cacao drink \u2013 stone ground beans that are mixed with water and used as an alternative to coffee. \n\nThe family puts a lot of focus on their children\u2019s education. Four of the kids are currently enrolled in either primary or secondary school.

In the future, Thomas hopes to expand his farm to grow it for the future generations in the family. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to hire help with cleaning the 300 newly planted trees.
