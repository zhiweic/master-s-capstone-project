Olman poco a poco le invirti\u00f3 y fue as\u00ed como compr\u00f3 un triciclo y puso un punto de ventas, en la medida en que fue dando  a conocer su negocio. Sus ventas las realiza de contado, de lunes a s\u00e1bados desde las 6:30 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 11 de la noche. Sus principales clientes son los transe\u00fantes q del centro de la ciudad pues est\u00e1 ubicado en un lugar eminentemente comercial y esto potencializa su venta. Sus compradores cada vez crecen en n\u00famero y en pedidos y por eso acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 un nuevo triciclo y materias primas e insumos para elaborar frituras y aumentar su producci\u00f3n y su mercado de clientes. Su meta es mas adelante tener mas zonas de acceso y una infraestructura de distribuci\u00f3n por todas las calles de la ciudad de Cartagena y especialmente muy cerca a las lindas playas de las que siempre disfruta.","en":"Olman is a 30 year old man. He is married and lives in the city of Cartagena, one of Colombia\u2019s nicest cities. He works there also, selling fried snacks and soft drinks, such as natural fruit juices made from seasonal tropical fruit. His drinks provide welcome refreshment to his customers soaking up the Columbian sun. \r\n\r\nOlman learned to make fried food 3 years ago, as his mother worked in this area also. In order to generate higher sales, he got the idea that he could sell the products his mother was making. He decided to sell these products from a mobile unit. From there he set up his own business, which soon started to grow. \r\n\r\nOlman invested in the business little by little, buying a tricycle and customizing it as a point of sale, and over time people have gotten to know his business. \r\n\r\nHis sales are done on a cash basis, from Monday to Saturday from 6:30 in the morning until 11 at night. His main group of customers are the people who frequent the city centre. He locates his tricycle in a business area, which increases his sales capacity. \r\n\r\nThe number of customers and the number of orders are constantly increasing. For this reason he has approached Kiva for a loan. This is his first time requesting finance. His request is through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. \r\n\r\nHe will use the money to buy a new tricycle, as well as raw materials and supplies for use in preparing the fried food. In this way he will be able to increase production and increase his market. \r\n\r\nHis goal for the future is to operate in more than one area and to have a distribution infrastructure all over Cartagena, in particular close to its lovely beaches, which he himself goes regularly.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":296.82,"image":{"id":1349937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a new tricycle, as well as raw materials and supplies to make fried food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-05-13T15:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-12T15:50:12Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olman Teobaldo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64617},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":74680},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76423},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":78206},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80031},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":81898},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83809},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":85765},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":87766},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":89814},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91910},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":105081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.54,"local_amount":64617,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":65195.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705949,"comment":null},{"amount":41.07,"local_amount":74680,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75348.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968238,"comment":null},{"amount":42.04,"local_amount":76423,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":77107.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817420,"comment":null},{"amount":43.01,"local_amount":78206,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":78906.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323693,"comment":null},{"amount":44.02,"local_amount":80031,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-20T09:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":80747.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082927,"comment":null},{"amount":45.04,"local_amount":81898,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":82631.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062288,"comment":null},{"amount":46.1,"local_amount":83809,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:10Z","rounded_local_amount":84559.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731979,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T02:47:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559065,"name":"Alberto Hegel L","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alberto, de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, trabaja como cajero en un banco, es casado tiene un hijo por quien velar para garantizarle su desarrollo, Alberto est\u00e1 estudiando un postgrado en gerencia financiera est\u00e1 siendo apoyado por sus padres para lograr culminar sus estudios, es por eso que solicita el cr\u00e9dito para pagar el curso de titulaci\u00f3n ya que obteniendo dicho t\u00edtulo podr\u00e1 aspirar a un asenso en su centro de trabajo, lo que le permitir\u00e1 mejorar sus condiciones de vida con su familia.","en":"Alberto, who is 30 years old, works as a teller in a bank.

He is an excellent carpenter and he has good skills to make quality furniture. \r\n\r\nNazo has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband in his business.  Her husband would purchase a wood cutting machine and some tools such as a hammer, nails and wooden sheets for his shop.  As they have no other source of income, with the help of this loan, her husband will be able to continue his business, and with the net profit he will open a new shop for his son. \r\n\r\nNazo dreams

They lived in traditional extended families in the Niebala neighbourhood of Bougouni. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group know each other through being neighbours, friends and business associates. In the interest of increasing their capital and improving their businesses, they are members of the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. This is their first loan. \r\n\r\nThese women trade various food products such as vegetables, like Bintou, who is shown sitting down in the photo. With her loan, Bintou is going to buy five baskets of cucumbers from gardeners in neighbouring villages. She sells to individuals at the market and from home, both for cash and on credit. The majority of her customers are women. \r\n\r\nBintou expects to make an average of 40,000 CFA francs per month, which will be re-invested in the business and used to repay the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1350970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-05-13T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-12T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:50Z","rounded_local_amount":67410.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030192,"comment":null},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":67410.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819697,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":67410.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678617,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67410.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924228,"comment":null},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":67410.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207420,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:46Z","rounded_local_amount":67410.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972079,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-13T23:55:49Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559453,"name":"Z\u00e9naba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Z\u00e9naba  est une jeune femme de 27ans.

She raises and harvests organic cacao on a thee hectare parcel of land that she bought with the proceeds from many years of working and with help from her husband.\r\n\r\nShe has been working for 15 years alongside her oldest children who have been performing the constant tasks such as weeding and other things.  She says that she needed to turn over a large part of the soil when she first acquired her land, in order to make better use of the nutrients it contains.  She now needs capital to pay local workers to perform the farm tasks in less time and improve production.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve her income, her husband Raul rented a motorcycle taxi to take advantage of the days when they don't work in the fields. This generates additional income for the family's wellbeing.  She wants to build a house out of solid materials in order to improve her quality of life.  This will be her second loan through Kiva.

She lives with her husband and children in the S\u00e9bougou neighborhood, Cercle of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the republic of Mali).\n\nSince she did not attend school, due to social circumstances, Marie Madellene got involved in income-generating activities at a very young age, following her mother who was selling condiments.  After several years of apprenticeship alongside her mother, she ended up conducting several activities by herself (selling clothes and shoes etc.) long before she started selling groundnuts.  Marie Madellene has now been involved in this activity for 18 years and she enjoys a good network of customers.  She owes her strength as a seller to her ability to build customer loyalty, to her reasonable prices and to the good quality of her merchandise.\n\nShe turned to Soro Yiriwaso in order to increase her business and to meet customer demand.  She has been a client of Soro Yiriwaso for the past six years and has already taken one solidarity loan and one individual loan, which have all been duly repaid.

","en":"Ismoil is an honest, purposeful, and very hardworking person. For eleven years, he has been farming and raising livestock. His wife and children help him. His oldest son has gone to the Russian Federation for work; he will earn money there and send it home to feed the family and help his father continue his business. They live in an old house. Ismoil has been wanting to build a new house for several years, but has been unable to due to a lack of money. Now his son is grown, and Ismoil will soon host a wedding celebration for him. But first they need to build a good house for his son and daughter-in-law to live in.

From an early age on, she has been raising livestock. After coming from school, she would always help out her parents. At present Visola\u2019s husband is in the Russian federation as a migrant worker, and Visola manages the business on her own. Her daughter helps her in the business.
