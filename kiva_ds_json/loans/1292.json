Because of this, Aivaz decided to start his own activity and requested a loan. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Aivaz applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved as part of a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  A loan of $1500 will help Aivaz to purchase a secondhand car. He will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them inter-city.

Her youngest, 21 year-old son, Rabani, is studying economics at the Russian-Tajik Slavic University.  In the future, he wants to become a good specialist.

The mother wants to help her son and is requesting a loan for this purpose.  She plans to pay for this school year, so that her son could continue studying at the university.

She started to make wedding and baby candies (candies that are given at wedding ceremonies and when a baby is born) by herself. She showed her work to a couple of companies and they liked it. Later, a company asked her to work with them. The company would give her a list of orders, she would make the candies and then she would deliver them to the company. Working this way was good for her. She could spend time with her family and do the housework. She worked with this company for a long time. The company paid her half the amount for her labor on her last order, so she got sad and angry. That day, she delivered the orders and she decided to do this work on her own while she was on her way home.\r\n\r\n As soon as she got home, she told her husband: \"Take me to Istanbul. I will buy materials and do this work by myself.\" Her husband was shocked and thought she was saying these things because she was angry. But Nigar had made a decision. She insisted, and they went to Istanbul that day. They bought the necessary materials and started to work immediately. She does not have difficulty selling the products because her network is very good. She has been working for five years and earning money this way. She is going to buy varieties of baubles, tulle, lavender, ribbons and chains with the loan. She has two orders for baby candies, and she is going to deliver them. She aims to open her own shop, even if it will be small, hire two employees and teach her job to them. One of her children finished university and got married. She wants her younger child to go to university, and she wants to support him.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Genaline earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nGenaline is requesting a loan for 10,000 PHP, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nGenaline hopes to have a big grocery store and that her children will finish their education.

Since there were no sons in her family, Mavrupat has been helping out her father to raise livestock from childhood on. Now the skills she learned from her father help Mavrupat earn a living. She also has a small private farm and grows vegetables, herbs and fruits for her family table.\r\n\r\nFor over 30 years she has been her family\u2019s breadwinner thanks to raising livestock.

Josphat has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. He also joined One Acre Fund because he wanted better harvests. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 64 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. <br \/><br \/>Josphat is a reliable member of the community. He is married with five children. He is 38 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 16 years to support his family. In addition to this, Josphat is very active in his community and is involved in the savings group. He described his harvest last year as not being with One Acre Fund.

He joined this year in order to get new farming methods. As an active member in his community, Josphat also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  Josphat plans on using future profits from the harvest to save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business. He believes that his life will improve by working with One Acre Fund. <br \/><br \/>One Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Josphat and the Amani Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

He has extensive experience in raising chickens and livestock as well as dairy production. Sohib's large family lives on a farm in the countryside and their main source of income are their animals. Sohib's wife and children help manage the family farm and produce dairy products. Sohib has four children and in order to provide for their nutrition, clothing and education, as well as help his aging parents, Sohib must increase his monthly profits. To increase his profits Sohib has to expand his herd and prepare them for the winter by stocking up on feed. In order to achieve these goals Sohib has turned to \"Arvand\" for a loan, which will make his goal a reality. Sohib's family are all very grateful to microfinance bank \"Arvand\" for the help.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":346.46,"image":{"id":1470801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Her family's main source on income is livestock and Malika's daughters-in-law help her with the animals. Unfortunately, livestock and dairy sales are not enough to provide for a large family, so all the men are now migrant workers in Russia, making money for everyone back home. Malika wishes she could help her family more, as the family is growing and the house needs to be expanded. In the face of winter the family also needs to stock up on fuel to warm the house.

Apart from that, she is also cultivating vegetables and selling them in the daily market in the nearest town. Her husband and son are helping her in these businesses. She earns a daily net income of 300 INR from these businesses. Out of this income, she has been able to manage her household expenses in a decent manner. So Nakeshi is planning to increase her income by expanding the business. Looking into the demand of the locality, with the present loan, she wants to purchase a wheat roller milling machine. She is certain that this will generate a handsome income for her. With a portion of the loan, she also wants to purchase seeds and fertilizer for her vegetable cultivation.

She is a visionary and enterprising woman, which is why for the past five years she and her husband have been growing coffee.  They started with a piece of land which her husband inherited from his parents, and have put a lot of work and dedication into growing coffee.  When the school day is over they go out to the country where they work their land together.  It was Eva's husband who taught her how to farm.  Her goals and plans have gradually been coming to fruition since she is very optimistic and hardworking.  A goal she has is to buy a pickup truck with which to transport the harvested coffee beans to the place where they will be sold, as well as the inputs she needs to keep her coffee plants healthy and strong, with excellent foliage and good-sized coffee beans.  Her goal is to be able to install a cement patio where she can dry and clean the coffee before selling it.

He lives in the rural area of Lahore, Pakistan with his wife and six children. <br \/><br \/>He has been in the business of selling milk since childhood. He learned all the techniques for getting milk from his father. This is the only source of income for the family. He has to devote his full time and energy for his dairy farm. He delivers milk in the market and door-to-door. For delivery purposes, he uses his bicycle. He loads milk cans on his bicycle and delivers it early in the morning. His customers like the fresh and delicious milk he delivers. His monthly savings has become too low due to a rapid increase in the household expenses; the excess utility bills, school fees, uniforms and the expensive books highly affected his savings. He wants to get additional income so that he can cope with the household expenses.

I want to know every single law of our country, and to use that knowledge to determine fairness. Nobody is going to let you win, and our lives are one long competition, with every loss and win making you stronger. I think every person should understand this. The rules of this competition are codified in state laws. To win this competition you must know these rules and use them for your profit. \r\n\r\nWhen I was deciding where to go to university, I found that AUCA has the department that fits me best. I am happy that I found what I really need and want. Many people say that our country has enough lawyers, but I think that only a few people can become worthy lawyers. It must come from your heart, and as for me, I cannot wait until I begin learning jurisprudence.

Mourice is on the right side in the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 41 other individual farmers represented by this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMourice is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with 18 children.  Mourice is 68 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 16 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Mourice is very active in his community and is involved in the savings group.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMourice first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Mourice joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and earn enough to feed family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers.  Mourice plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Mourice\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

Her biggest dream in life is to become a model farmer and free people in her community from poverty by helping them to adopt better agricultural practices."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1508494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a mobile phone, solar charging set and weighing scale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kasese","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":259,"posted_date":"2014-01-09T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":35,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-11T08:20:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":655655,"name":"Yen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yen is 36 years old and married.

Patson has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right side of the photo, with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 93 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of KES 5,349 (shillings).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatson is a reliable member of the community. He is married, with 12 children. Patson is 54 years old and he has been working as a farmer for the last 25 years to support his family. In addition to this, Patson is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group. He described his harvest last year as being good. He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatson  joined One Acre Fund in 2009 and he is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Patson joined One Acre Fund, so that he could get the best seed prices. Because he is an active community member, Patson has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund, as a group leader and as a Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Patson 's life because he has more farm training. In the future, Patson  hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nPatson and the Amani Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers, as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

Mabadiliko Group. Josephat has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 63 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum each. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nJosephat is 51 years old and has been a farmer for 31 years. Josephat works as a farmer to provide for his nine children. The community and other farmers know Josephat as friendly, hardworking and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in community groups such as the men's group. Josephat described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Josephat\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send his children to school. As an active member in his community, Josephat also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers. Josephat plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school, save for the future and buy a cow. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training and he is able to feed the family. Josephat also joined One Acre Fund because he wants more food surplus. Josephat\u2019s life has also improved because he pays school fees.  \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Josephat and the Mabadiliko Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1487066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bainito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jafred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sifuna","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":336987,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336987}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":655662,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is 30 years old and lives in Caldwell.

She lives with her husband and her small 3 year old son. Since she finished high school, her mother taught her how to sew, activity that has become her main source of income. Currently she works in her own sewing workshop, located in her home. From there she helps others and generates enough resources to support her husband with home expenses.\r\n\r\nBibiana's purpose is to expand her workshop and buy more machinery to generate employment, but she knows that in order to achieve this she has to work hard, with determination and discipline.

He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving farm inputs (hybrid seeds and fertilizer) for one quarter acre of maize and one quarter acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average loan of 5,349 KES.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nHenry is a reliable member of the community.  He is is 48 years old, married, with eight children.  Henry has been working as a farmer for the last 26 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Henry is very active in his community and is involved in a men's group and prayer group.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue to work with One Acre Fund and to enjoy the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Henry\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He joined One Acre Fund in 2010 and has been working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer, and hybrid seeds.  As an active member in his community, Henry also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member.  Henry plans on using future profits from the harvest to invest in a business.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he was able to feed his family and send his children to school.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nHenry and the Upendo Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo, standing on the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1487002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To obtain hybrid seeds and fertilizer to improve harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukomere","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Omukala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mutende","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Akhonya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":278148,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278148}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643936,"name":"Nilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nilda is 45 years old and married, and she has four children.

She has been weaving since before her marriage and continues weaving after her marriage. Her friends commented that she is a good weaver. She joined Huikap Pukhri Mapan SHG with nine other women members and they are all hard working. She is the featured borrower for the group and she is pictured with her hand raised. All the members live in the same neighborhood, which is about 45 kms from the capital.\n\nIbemcha weaves all kinds of women's wrap arounds and shawls. During the festive season, which falls between October and March, Ibemcha\u2019s weaving business is at peak. Women from neighboring villages, neighbors and women vendors in the market contact her for woven products for weddings, send-off ceremonials and other meitei celebrations. If she could deliver all the demands on time, then she could make a good income, but it is difficult because she weaves alone, and it takes three or four days to complete one women's wrap around skirts. To supply a dozen of them requires a month. The finished products are usually sold to the women vendors who sit in the main Imphal market in the capital town of Manipur, which is about 45 kms from where she lives. She supplies them at wholesale and that way the generated income is beneficial.\n\nWith the loan, Ibemcha is planning to buy lots of yarns and threads to weave. This is still the wedding season and she has a number demands from the women who sell her products in the main market. Before she took the loan, she used to get her yarn supplies from the shopkeeper on credit and repay  when the woven products are sold. She is happy that with the loan support she does not ask for credit and she can easily make a spot payment and get the full profit without paying half the share to the shopkeepers. She says thank you to Kiva. \n\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving and vegetable selling businesses.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1506379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase more yarn and threads","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-09T21:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T21:30:15Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibemcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sakhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tombisana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nungshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanao","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjana`","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chaobi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-13T20:07:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":654179,"name":"Abrar Alhodeida Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Abrar Alhodeida.

Her husband died in February 2013, and Bazargul was left alone with their children. After her husband's death, Bazargul became involved in farming and livestock in order to find a source of income for the family. She started her business with 2,000 KGS. Thanks to her extremely hard work, Bazargul has had some small successes developing her farm, and she began to earn a monthly income of 8,000 KGS. Currently, Bazargul's farm has two sheep and a 0.60 hectares plot where she grows cotton. All of the children help on the farm. They understand their mother's difficult situation and financial problems. The children diligently try to help their mother with the work. The two older children are working in Russia. They help financially by sending their salary every month to the family in Kyrgyzstan.

He is married: his wife does the household chores and helps look after the cows that they have. The couple's two daughters now have their own homes.\r\n\r\nUnable to work in construction any longer, Francisco starting growing corn, beans and sorghum. He also has three dairy cows, the milk from which he sells at $0.40 per litre. The three cows produce 25 bottles between them. Francisco has a deal with the person who buys the milk and so he continues with production. The cows and crops are 500 metres from Francisco's house and they require looking after every day.\r\n\r\nFrancisco is applying for a loan to buy a dairy cow as he already has a deal with someone who buys the milk and Francisco must provide the agreed number of bottles. During this dry season milk production decreases due to a lack of feed for the animals. As a result, Francisco has decided to buy another cow which can help him to maintain normal levels of production.

Abdukahor is involved in agriculture.  He grows agricultural crops on his land plot (3 hectares).  Family expenses are covered by the agricultural business income.  The children are growing and so are their needs, and this is why Abdukahor decided to also start an animal husbandry business.

He was born in a village which has good conditions for livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. Amrullo's family had a low income and since childhood he helped his parents with farming. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing high school, Amrullo got married, and his wife helped him with the livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. They mainly worked with cattle breeding, purchasing cattle at a low price at the market, and after a certain time of fattening them, resell them at a higher price.

Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum for cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBenard is 65 years old and has been a farmer for three years.  Benard works as a farmer to provide for his nine children.  The community and other farmers know Benard as friendly and hardworking.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group, prayer group and burial committee.  Benard described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Benard\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  As an active member in his community, Benard also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  Benard plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future and buy a cow.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, was able to save money and feed the family.  Benard also joined One Acre Fund because he wanted to  eliminate hunger in his home.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBenard and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1487048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-11T00:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T00:10:06Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":192564,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192564}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643987,"name":"Roseline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roseline, a mother of four children, farms in the Nyamira area, which is popular for banana growing.
