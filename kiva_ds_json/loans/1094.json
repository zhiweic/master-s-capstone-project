They have three daughters who depend on their income. They live in the province of Punata in the city of Cochabamba. Thanks to their work they were able to build a house on a plot inherited from his mother. They are a humble but united family. Lucy is a primary school teacher, but because of widespread unemployment in the country she cannot obtain a position and therefore she works in the same field as her husband, producing raw milk. They have dairy cows in their home. They sell the milk to a business that makes dairy products.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the loan is to buy fodder to improve the diet of the cows. Also, in the last year they increased the number of dairy cattle and therefore these also need additional fodder.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time that Ariel is benefiting from a Kiva loan. He says that he is very happy with the first loan since it helped him a lot in buying a dairy cow. Among his dreams and goals is to grow his herd of dairy cattle until he has a small farm with at least 30 cows, and for his three daughters to study a professional career in order to have a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1076405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fodder for his dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2013-04-09T16:40:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-09T16:40:19Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ariel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250.03,"local_amount":1700.19,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1727.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364498361,"comment":null},{"amount":124.97,"local_amount":849.81,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:47:25Z","rounded_local_amount":863.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372903708,"comment":null},{"amount":578.73,"local_amount":3935.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3998.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382131086,"comment":null},{"amount":46.35,"local_amount":315.15,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":320.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399793125,"comment":null},{"amount":102.07,"local_amount":694.07,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":705.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410069676,"comment":null},{"amount":397.85,"local_amount":2705.45,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2749.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429487425,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-23T23:20:43Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T14:19:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":536443,"name":"Aniceto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Aniceto, de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, concubinado, dos hijos, bachiller.

Fernando used to live in the community of Senda F and about two years ago he had to come to Chimore because he didn't make enough income to support his family. Fernando left his parents when he came to live in Chimore, where with his wife he started a new life from zero.

is 24 years old. He lives in Kutaisi District, West Georgia, with his 24-year-old wife, 53-year-old father, and an infant, Barbare. Bakar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nBakar\u2019s father is a car artisan. He works on private orders, fixes the cars and gets a small salary, which is the only source of the income for the family.\r\n\r\nRecently, Bakar requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Bakar will purchase a car at a low cost, to resell it with the price mark-up. He will reinvest the income to buy another car and develop this business.

He farms with his family and lives 5 km from the village of Mizque, where there are schools. To receive primary education children have to travel every day on foot, in some cases in vehicles which could be traveling that route. \r\n\r\nBecause he has so many children to support and to meet all the expenses, Isauro even works nights in his fields to reduce production costs. \r\n\r\nBecause of the continuous rains recorded in the area during the month of February 2013, Isauro has suffered from water saturation and overflowing of the rivers, resulting in spoilage of his potato crop on his productive parcels and losses to a good part of his property. This has resulted in a reduction of his income. For these reasons, his financial stability has suffered a setback, directly affecting the acquisition of materials and supplies needed for his farming and the education of the children. \r\n\r\nTo deal with the above-mentioned he has has turned to credit, with the aim of improving his quality of life, stabilizing his family's financial situation and returning to the road to prosperity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":362.5,"image":{"id":1318367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy organic fertilizer and agricultural chemicals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2013-04-09T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-09T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isauro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150.36,"local_amount":1036.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410069802,"comment":null},{"amount":212.14,"local_amount":1463.03,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1465.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833258,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-20T11:38:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541247,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Michael naci\u00f3 en la provincia Carrasco, tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad, termino el colegio con bastantes esfuerzos  trabajando y estudiando al mismo tiempo, a pesar delas dificultades al egresar del colegio fue a la ciudad de Santa cruz a buscar trabajo.

She is married, but she doesn't have any children.  Her husband works at a high school as a teacher and he receives a small salary, which is not enough to provide for their family's needs.  Kholida decided to help her husband for the good of her family.  With that goal in mind, she enrolled in the \"To Get Ahead\" course offered by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She wants to start a business sewing and selling wedding dresses, as she has experience sewing wedding dresses and she has a vivid imagination and good taste.  Since she lives in a village far from the city center, she has many clients who want to order her wedding dresses.  Kholida will sew her dresses at home and sell them to the brides in her village.  She plans to use her income to improve her family's living conditions.  She is asking for a loan of 500 somoni to buy fabrics to start her new business.

He comes from a humble family and lives with his mother, who helps him financially with his studies at CampoAlto. She is the head of the household and supports him with his studies, giving him strength and support being in a city by himself. He therefore must make an effort to have a better and more pleasant life for the future and what he hopes for in life, to care for and offer well being to his brother who is in the eighth grade. He is sure that he will support his brother because his brother has been a great friend and support throughout his entire life. He hopes that he strives as he is doing now to be someone important in society.\r\n\r\nHe is staying in the house of his godparents, who extended the offer of housing to him so that he would be able to study, as where he is from they don't offer the educational service that he is hoping to obtain. \r\n\r\nHe decided to run after a dream; to serve as a cook, for which he is studying at CampoAlto. He does this because he likes it and was also born to do it so that later, with the help of the institution and the support of his family, he may have a professional life that satisfies the financial necessities intersecting in the course of his life and help his mother financially, as she has been a very large source of support for him. \r\n\r\nHe went to CampoAlto on the advice of a former student of the institution so that he could study what he is passionate about.

They grow potatoes, beans, peas, corn and barley in the community of Plano Bajo-T\u00edraque which is located about 65 km from the city of Cochabamba.  Nancy and her parents would really like to increase their agricultural production so they are requesting a loan to buy poultry manure to help them achieve a higher yield.

Because of unfortunate events, she has been an orphan since she was very young.  She remained in the care of her grandparents, but because they had very few financial resources, they left her in the care of her godmother.  Sandra\u2019s godmother sold food for a living and she taught Sandra how to cook. Sandra also has two children who don\u2019t know their father because he abandoned them when they were still young. In order to provide for her children, she had to work in different areas until her godmother eventually gave up her sales stand two years ago. Now Sandra Te\u00f3fila sells food from the stand and, little by little, she is equipping her kitchen. Sandra will use the current loan to buy new dishes since her present ones aren't in very good condition. This will help her to continue giving her children a decent life.

","en":"Sulaymon is an honest and hard-working man. He is married and has children. Sulaymon raises cattle and, in addition, grows apricots in season. In the summer he harvests apricots, dries them, and sells in winter. But his main source of income is from raising cattle. Many of his friends have left for [the Russian Federation] and encouraged him to go along with them, but Sulaymon does not want to leave his family behind and attempts to make a living in his  native country as best he can.\r\n\r\nEvery month Sulaymon brings cattle to the market for sale, and immediately uses his revenue to buy young cattle. This business brings in a very good income, so Sulaymon tries to keep developing it. For a long time, he has wanted to buy his own [truck] in order to bring cattle to the market more easily. But for now he lacks the means, so at present he plans to increase his headcount. Sulaymon wants to use his loan to buy cattle and expand his business, which will help him continue saving for a truck. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":951.18,"image":{"id":1323138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy  cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Asht","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.666667 70.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-10T03:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-10T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sulaymon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":430.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":459.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":474.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":489.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":505.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":522.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":539.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":557.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":575.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.53,"local_amount":430.36,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":440.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572699,"comment":null},{"amount":95.57,"local_amount":444.52,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":454.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971470,"comment":null},{"amount":98.71,"local_amount":459.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":469.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751989,"comment":null},{"amount":101.97,"local_amount":474.25,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":485.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616075,"comment":null},{"amount":105.32,"local_amount":489.85,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":501.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859946,"comment":null},{"amount":108.78,"local_amount":505.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":517.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136691,"comment":null},{"amount":112.36,"local_amount":522.61,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":534.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900889,"comment":null},{"amount":116.06,"local_amount":539.81,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":552.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550070,"comment":null},{"amount":119.88,"local_amount":557.57,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":570.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774295,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-21T11:54:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545967,"name":"Linda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linda, who goes by \u201cLindy Lou,\u201d was a welder in San Francisco before a vacation in Austin convinced her to migrate to a more economical place to live. But she couldn\u2019t stand welding in the paralyzing Texas heat and was soon looking for a new line of work.\r\n\r\nThen, one night in 2003, she stepped out in a pair of <i>Souvenir<\/i> shoes which got her a lot of attention \u2013 and got her to thinking about parlaying the shoes into a new career. The Souvenir is a wooden wedge peep-toe shoe with a carved heel often with brightly painted designs. It was wildly popular during World War II when U.S. soldiers gifted them to their wives or girlfriends back home; hence, the name.\r\n\r\nLinda thought of getting them reproduced, found descendants of the family who originally hand-carved them in the Philippines, and convinced them to carve for her. She soon hit stores and trade shows worldwide with her new business, Lucky Lou, selling an average of 300 pairs per show.\r\n\r\nLinda\u2019s \u201covernight\u201d entrepreneurial success story came to a sudden halt in 2009 when she says her manufacturer began cutting corners and producing bad quality shoes, which resulted in a large number of returns and refunds. After deciding to end her business relationship with the manufacturer, Linda was shocked to find him taking everything she had, including copyrighted designs and pictures from advertising photo shoots, and selling her designs for a lot less. He effectively put her out of business.\r\n\r\n\u201cI begged and pleaded for everyone to help me,\u201d she recalls. Linda went to multiple organizations for a loan and was turned down each time until she found ACCION Texas Inc. \u2013 thanks to a referral from BIG Austin. \u201cThey were very supportive. That launch from ACCION enabled me to purchase 600 shoes, then those sales helped me to purchase 1,000,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nLinda found a new manufacturer in September and is now contracting with other designers such as Betty Page Clothing. Linda has also been in contact with tattoo artist Kat Von D and pop singer Katy Perry\u2019s managers to design something Linda will manufacture. She says, since she can place any design on the shoe, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t appeal to the entire market of women.\u201d She says, without the loan, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in business; there\u2019s no way.\u201d Because of ACCION, \u201cI just sold the first batch and made $22,000 in two days. I\u2019m doing another show this week. It was really good timing for once in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\nStores in Italy, Spain and other European countries now sell her product. And, with the initial funds from ACCION, she was able to hire a graphic designer and a photographer. Though they aren\u2019t full-time employees, she plans to put them and her assistant on her payroll soon and hire someone to take over her social media pages. When she gets an office, she plans to hire someone to work there full-time.\r\n\r\nLinda says her best-selling design is the Rockin\u2019 Tiki.

She has been running a clothing sales business since 1999 and accumulated a vast amount of experience. In 2007, she and her husband went to Korea on an employment contract, but returned to Mongolia to give birth to their second child. During the summer time when most construction work takes place, her husband works at a construction site.\r\n\r\nIn January, 2013, the house they used to live in burned down due to an accident and they were forced to stay in a Mongolian traditional ger in harsh winter time weather. Now the price of building materials is reaching its lowest level and buying them will benefit the family greatly. So she is requesting a loan of 6,800,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as bricks, cement, planks, iron and plates. Compared to the Mongolian traditional ger, a house enables the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and it contributes to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is very hardworking individual who strives for a better life.

She is 34 years old and a very kind woman.  \r\n\r\nOver four years ago, she started her own business, buying and selling ice-cream.

He works at the local furniture workshop on a small monthly salary. His father is an artisan too, who works on construction for private orders. The family's additional income is from Ramaz\u2019s parent\u2019s monthly pensions.\r\n \r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Ramaz will purchase all the needed materials to open his own furniture workshop.

has lived in Viwandani, an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, for the past twelve years. The father of two is a shrewd businessman who is able to analyse the market conditions and viability of any products and services that he decides to offer his customers. He has built and sustained businesses such as video shows, barber shops and farming.\r\nFrom his judgement, Fresh Life toilets are affordable to area residents, and the absence of a sanitation facility in the vicinity makes his choice very strategic. He will therefore be able to provide residents in his area with sanitation while making a profit. \r\nHe hopes that the Fresh Life toilets will be as successful as he has calculated and that he will expand the benefits of better sanitation to other parts of the informal settlement.\r\nJohn dreams big and wants to own a company as well as be a front liner in community sanitation initiatives.

He breeds cattle and sells them for meat purposes to local butchers. Rasif has 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father who taught him the best way to look after cattle. Hard life conditions and unemployment pushed him to start his own business. \r\n\r\nRasif usually buys calves and raises and fattens them over five to six months. Then he resells them for a profit at the local livestock bazaar. Meat selling brings him 500 AZN in income per month.

being orphaned at a young age, losing six of his seven siblings, and only having had seven years of schooling,  Aaron has risen above his circumstances to become a well-respected and compassionate member of his community. Aaron has a family of five, a growing business, and supports ten orphans, providing them shelter in his native Uganda and helping them to attend school. Aaron hopes to better support his loved ones by buying and selling more improved firewood cookstoves which use 50% less firewood. These stoves save his customers money in reduced  firewood needs or save them time in collecting firewood. They also reduce emissions of toxic gases which  improve health outcomes in his community. With the help of a Kiva Loan, Aaron will be able to consolidate his business's product offerings while simultaneously generating needed income to send his children and dependents to school.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1327377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for improved firewood cook stoves ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":290,"posted_date":"2013-04-10T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-10T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":936000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":234000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":234000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":234000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":234000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":234000,"processed_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:00:09Z","rounded_local_amount":243093,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381833313,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":234000,"processed_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":243093,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390691746,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":234000,"processed_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":243092.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399938556,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":234000,"processed_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":243093,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410222168,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-10T16:44:11Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T19:56:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":546176,"name":"Al-Bdor Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Al-Bdor and consists of 6 ladies in Yemen.

While his wife stays at home and takes care of the kids, Ahliddin runs a cattle ranching business. He's had this business, which is located in a very convenient place, for the past 11 years. Ahliddin is familiar with all the nuances of his business, so he's able to complete his job easily and be very satisfied with his work. \r\n\r\nNow, he's trying to expand his business and is, therefore, asking for a loan of 2000 soms, which will enable him to purchase some heads of cattle. This will increase his working capital and will allow him to achieve higher profits. With these profits, he'd like to purchase a television, something his children have been asking for a long time. He's hoping for your help.

Also, on the week-ends she works as a field worker on some of the agricultural farms in her city.  Teresa works every day for approximately ten hours.  She believes that is going well for her due to the good prices and the kind service that she offers to others.\r\n\r\nTeresa is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the help given to her she will be able to buy a greater quantity and a variety of groceries like rice, sugar, milk, mixed vegetables, and others.  This way Teresa will have her store better stocked, and she will be able to tend to more customers.  This way she will continue working and putting forth great effort in order to fulfill her big dream of being able to give her children a good education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1328659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a greater quantity and a variety of groceries like rice, sugar, milk, mixed vegetables, and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"GUADALUPE","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-04-10T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-10T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":76.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":78.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":87.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.62,"local_amount":76.55,"processed_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":79.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483427,"comment":null},{"amount":31.31,"local_amount":78.28,"processed_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":80.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889477,"comment":null},{"amount":32.39,"local_amount":80.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664376,"comment":null},{"amount":33.89,"local_amount":84.72,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":87.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775785,"comment":null},{"amount":35.16,"local_amount":87.9,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":90.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779100,"comment":null},{"amount":36.63,"local_amount":91.58,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":94.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054279,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-10T16:42:05Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:17:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":546403,"name":"Jessica Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jessica, solicita un nuevo prestamo por la necesidad de seguir invirtiendo en el negocio.

He lives in the Fuzuli region, which is close to the occupied border. He is applying for his second loan from Kiva to buy fruits and vegetables to sell. He will use the 2,000 AZN (Azerbaijan New Manat) loan to buy potatoes, onions and cabbage to sell at local bazaars. He will use the additional income he earns from this loan to better care for his family.

His business is 25 years old as it is part of a family tradition. Fish has been his life since he was a little boy, when together with his father he would go fishing and then sell their catch in marketplace.  His business has allowed him to support his family, which is made up of his common-law wife and their 13-year-old daughter, whom he hopes to see become a successful professional.  He makes his sales on foot, in cash, during work days that start at four in the morning and last until midday.\r\n\r\nHe currently buys from wholesalers who offer a wide variety of very fresh fish.  He gets his best deals with them, especially when he has enough working capital to buy in volume and get discounts.  His future goal is to have a storefront and to offer his family a better quality of life.  This is why he takes great pains to find the best commercial alternatives to increase his clientele and make more money.  He is currently applying for a Kiva loan, which is the first loan he is taking out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use it to buy fish to be supplied for the season, taking into account his presale orders, which are the reason his investment of this loan is very likely to be successful.

He lives in Lahore, Pakistan with his family.  His family consists of 5 children and a wife. He owns a small electrician shop in the area which is the only source of income for his family.

He has his own house, where he works every day in order to give himself a better quality of life.  Gregorio's work consists of agriculture; he makes a living planting and harvesting two products fundamental to the area in which he lives. His palm oil crop and product is sold to a very large industry dedicated to making oil, but he also makes a living through the cocoa crop, which he sells to various buyers who come from other places in search of these products because the region produces the best of these fruits.  Both crops are promoted as an alternative to the coca leaf.\r\n\r\nHe has six years of experience working with cocoa and four years of experience with palm oil plants.  He works alone, and when there are planting and harvesting seasons he hires some workers who help him complete the orders on time.

Lily used to weave when she was younger, but with age, she couldn\u2019t continue and shifted her business into the piggery when she availed a loan for the first time. She is pictured here with her hand raised and is the featured member of Sarah Group. Their group is 13 strong and all of the group members belong to a tribal community. The group members share the same thoughts and analogous principles. This is the binding force to carry on with their activity and leads them in development.\r\n\r\nLily says that starting a business in a place like where she lives is difficult. She also adds that the lack of demand for woven products, a bigger market and low capital paralyze her business activities. Lily used to weave to supplement the family income but stopped after she experienced a backache because of the back straps she used for weaving.  Lily now raises pigs and sells them when fully grown in the village and nearby villages. Lily makes more money with the piggery than she made when she used to weave. She decided to expand her piggery and raise pigs full time.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Lily is planning to buy more piglets and more feed. Her aspiration to own a large piggery farm can be accomplished if she is successful with her planning. Lily believes that her piggery business will immensely improve the financial condition of the family.

She has been running a grocery business for five years now. She works from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be her sixteenth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.

The loan will help Teopista generate greater profits and pay some of the school fees for her children. She hopes that in the future she will be able to build rental houses. \r\n\r\nTeopista is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is 49 years old, married and has three children, a 11-year-old, a 4-year-old son and a 2-year-old  daughter. Her son goes to school. Her son wants to become a firefighter. \r\n\r\nFirangiz has been an IDP (Internally Displaced Person) from Fuzuli city. Now she lives in the Fuzuli region, which is close to the occupied border. This is Firangiz's second loan from Kiva. She is very thankful to Komak and Kiva for her first loan. She started her business 9 years ago as a clothes-selling business.

is 20 years old and lives in the town of Wobulezi in the Luwero region of Uganda. She is married and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past two years, Rose has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rose has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food such as cassava, sweet potatoes, and fresh vegetables to sell, and will help Rose to generate greater profits and buy her children new clothes and bed sheets for her home. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to build rental houses. \r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are small-scale business people from Koidu, a city in eastern Sierra Leone. They have come to Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva, to apply for a loan of SLL 500,000 for each person in the group in order to enable them to expand their respective businesses. With a loan of SLL 500,000 each, they will be able to add more stocks into their businesses, make more sales, and more profit. Consequently, they will be able to improve their standard of living by sending their children to school, and to feed and clothe them. \r\n\r\nMarian (pictured in the middle) is the featured leader of this group.
