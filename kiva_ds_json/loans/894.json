That has been a profitable project, but also needs more support to cover the costs.\r\n\r\nKhitam wants to live in better conditions with her family, so she is requesting a 2,000 USD loan from FATEN to help her complete the price of purchasing a new vehicle. This will facilitate the movement of Khitam and her family from one place to another and help Khitam's husband to carry the plastic products to his stall, which will increase sales and improve the family's income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1125657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal

Lo que es conveniente para Hugo, porque con este negocio puede tener un dinero extra adem\u00e1s de su sueldo mensual y tambi\u00e9n la fotocopiadora le es de gran ayuda para sus labores como maestro, as\u00ed no le falta material de clase, ni para \u00e9l, ni a sus alumnos.

This is his primary job, which he enjoys very much because he loves his students. He has been a teacher for 18 years. Additionally, he has a small business where he offers photocopying services, charging a very fair price at 10 cents (PEN) a copy. This works out well for Hugo, because it is additional income and it is also very useful in his work as a teacher because he never is lacking in materials for his class, for himself or for his students. In government run schools, there are not enough funds to cover these expenses, so he is able to use his own copy machine to do so.     \r\n\r\nHe is very thankful for the financial support that he receives through MFP, which is why he promises to make his repayments on time.

Currently she has a business distributing eggs through her store, work she has been doing for several years, having learned it in a previous job. \r\n\r\nThe loan she will take out now is to increase her capital (buying eggs at wholesale) which she will purchase in the city of Cochabamba and later sell in her store. \r\n\r\nThis form of work helps her family move forward, as she is in a common-law relationship and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen we asked her what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answered that she likes the health training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1122861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy eggs at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-07-04T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-03T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernardina Maria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhanneth\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliza\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23232.32,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3318.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":478.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":957.18,"local_amount":6638.04,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6661.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495262,"comment":null},{"amount":478.58,"local_amount":3319.02,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3330.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260806,"comment":null},{"amount":478.59,"local_amount":3319.02,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3330.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490516,"comment":null},{"amount":478.59,"local_amount":3319.02,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3330.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095375,"comment":null},{"amount":957.06,"local_amount":6637.22,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6661.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235456,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She deems that her business is quite profitable because of the profits it produces that she can use to pay household expenses and to provide a good education for her children.  Before starting this business it was difficult to cover all household and educational expenses.  Her plan for the future is to expand the business and set up her own workshop at home.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP so she now has support from this loan to reach her goals.  She commits to make her installment payments in order to establish a good credit history.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 3000 new soles to buy supplies needed to manufacture the furniture like lumber, lacquer and a handsaw valued at 380 new soles.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1122917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

Her house is made of cement and has electricity.  In this area it is common to not have good drinking water from the tap so the inhabitants buy it from tanker trucks.  In spite of everything, Nancy has a small sewing workshop which she began with the help of her husband who bought Nancy her first sewing machine seven years ago.  Currently she has an industrial sewing machine that she bought with a previous loan, an upholstery machine, and a cutting table.  She works from eight in the morning to eight at night, sometimes by herself and sometimes informally hiring someone.  Her main orders are uniforms for schools, businesses, and sports as well as dresses.  She makes quantities between 300 and 100 garments, depending on the order.  Her biggest inconvenience is that in her area there are problems with the electricity and it goes out with some frequency, making her lose time and potentially damaging her equipment.  The loan will be used to buy fabrics and threads for her workshop and to buy concrete blocks, cement, and sand to expand her house so that her husband can open a grocery store.

Since 1985 Yrsalatkhan has been raising animals and growing field crops. She started this business with 800 soms (KGS). Thanks to Yrsalatkhan's hard work, her business now has livestock which, to save money, are sent off to a hilly pasture to feed, and 1.08 hectares of land on which she grows cotton and corn.\r\n\r\nWith a goal to further develop her business, Yrsalatkhan has come to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 soms (KGS) to buy small livestock for fattening. Yrsalatkhan plans to invest the income from the loan into increasing her livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1130246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Mombekovo village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-07-05T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-04T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yrsalatkhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3109},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3681},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3775},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3904},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3971},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4098},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4176},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4283},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4439},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4505},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4628},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5431}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":442643,"name":"Tarana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tarana is a 40-year-old married woman with three children.

ni\u00f1o ayudando en la finca de sus padres. Tambi\u00e9n sabe la perforaci\u00f3n de pozos y su limpieza ya que en el campo es de esta manera como se abastecen de agua. Se dedica a la plantaci\u00f3n de pepinos y choclos los cuales vende la plaza de Milagros. Empieza su d\u00eda a las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 5 de la tarde, ya que en el campo se debe aprovechar al m\u00e1ximo la luz solar. Cuando se va a cosechar primero se debe preparar la tierra, como vemos en la foto la tierra esta arada, el arado se hace con animales o maquinas. Luego de preparar la tierra se tira la semilla para que empiece la siembra y posterior a esto la cosecha. Su mayor dificultad es los cambios clim\u00e1ticos sobre todo la temporada invernal por las inundaciones. Su esposa y sus hijos le ayudan cuando no est\u00e1n en la escuela. El pr\u00e9stamo que Carlos est\u00e1 solicitando es para la compra de semillas,  fertilizante y una bomba para la fumigaci\u00f3n. Espera que la siguiente cosecha le permita cubrir las cuotas y dejarle dinero para arreglar su casa. ","en":"Carlos is 43 years old and has always made a living harvesting products with a short cycle. He has done this work since he was a child helping at his parents' farm. He also knows how to drill and clean wells since this is how water is provided in the countryside. \r\n\r\nHe makes a living planting cucumber and corn which he sells in the Milagros plaza. He begins his day at 5 in the morning and works until 5 in the evening because he must take advantage of the sunlight the best he can in the countryside. When he reaps a harvest he must first prepare the land. As we see in the photo, the land is plowed. The plowing is done with animals or machines. After preparing the land he plants the seeds so they begin to grow and after that is the harvest. His greatest difficulty is climatic change, above all the winter season because of the floods. \r\n\r\nHis wife and children help him when they are not in school. The loan that Carlos requests is to buy seeds, fertilizer and a spray pump. He hopes that the next harvest will allow him to make his loan payments and leave him money to fix up his house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1122969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds, fertilizer and a spray pump.

He learned this skill by working as a salesman in a company, but he left because of the low pay they gave him. He decided to start his own business over a year ago.

from Sierra Leone! This is 26-year-old Isata from Kulanda town in the southern area of Sierra Leone. She is married with two children, ages five and seven years. One of her children attends school. Isata began her business, because she did not go to school, so her parents taught her about business. \r\n\r\nIsata runs a local food stand in a busy market area. She sells Maggie cubes, onions, tomato paste and oil. She has been running this business for ten years. She works at the business from 7:00 am until 7:30 pm, seven days per week. Her business is the only source of income she has. At present, she faces two challenges during the rainy season: low purchasing power and the business becoming wet and spoilt.\r\n\r\nIsata has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking seasonings such as Maggie cubes, onions, tomato paste and oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to renovate the roof of her house. In the future, she wants to expand her business with a huge amount of product so that she would be able to take care of her family. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1128755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

28-year-old Bintu from Kandeh town, southern area in Bo, Sierra Leone. She is married with 2 children ages 6 years and 10 years. She has four children that are currently attending school; two are relatives of hers. In 2002, Bintu established her table business that sells palm oil, fish, Maggi and rice. She began her business because at 17 years she left school and got married. Her husband is a driver but his income is not enough to support her. She started to run a small-scale trading business to increase the income in the home. She wakes up at 5:30 am to go to the next village to buy goods and sell them on her table. She will not rest until 7:30 pm. She says that the main challenge to her business is there is no vehicle to enter the village where she usually buys goods.\r\n\r\nBintu requires a loan in order to buy more food commodities like palm oil, fish, Maggi and rice. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and expand her business. In the future, Bintu plans to establish her business in Bo town. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1128734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

from Sierra Leone! This is 40-year-old Fatmata from Kandeh town in Bo southern area, Sierra Leone. She is married with two children between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Her children attend school. \r\n\r\nFatmata runs a clothing and textiles shop; she sells zippers, thread, needles, buttons, and scissors. She has been running this business for 12 years. She works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. Her other source of income comes from her elder brother. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy more textiles such as zippers, thread, needles, buttons, and scissors. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her standard of living and educate her children. In the future, she plans to build a house on her own. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1128873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Teddy is 21 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past year, Teddy has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells fresh food like sweet potatoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Teddy has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh foods like sweet potatoes for resale, and will help Teddy to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Teddy hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build on it. \r\n\r\nTeddy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Teddy's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

Florence is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past three years, Florence has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh fish. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fish for resale, and will help Florence to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Florence hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a car and build a house for herself. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Florence's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save her money.

However, she also occasionally buys livestock to re-sell.  She has a 55-hectare plot of land where she keeps her animals and has the support of one person who helps to care for them.  She started this business more than 18 years ago with her own capital, buying in small quantities and then increasing.  Before starting this business she had financial problems because her expenses rose with the arrival of her children.  She wanted to provide her children with a better quality of life and support her partner with the household expenses.  Given the good results she continues to see in her business, she would like to increase the size of her herd.\r\n\r\nThis is Lindis' 10th loan from MFP and she feels happy and grateful for the opportunity to have a line of credit so that she can make progress in her business.  For this reason, she pledges to make her repayments on time as she did with her previous loans.\r\n\r\nLindis will use the 1,000 soles she has requested to buy a baby bull, valued at 500 soles.   She will invest the rest in buying fodder to feed her animals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1124074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a baby bull and feed for her herd","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-05T13:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-04T13:00:06Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lindis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":152.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":164.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":165.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":176.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":182.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.14},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.61},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.38,"local_amount":310.95,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":327.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401998,"comment":null},{"amount":65.69,"local_amount":164.22,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":173.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456273,"comment":null},{"amount":66.14,"local_amount":165.36,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":174.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451938,"comment":null},{"amount":70.61,"local_amount":176.52,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":186.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447112,"comment":null},{"amount":73.18,"local_amount":182.95,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":192.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053016,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-06T23:20:44Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":441469,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia tiene 41 a\u00f1os, es una mujer trabajadora y muy emprendedora.

As a result, she invited Dora, who she had known for a number of years, to support her in the tortilla business.  This has worked out pretty well for her everyday customers.  The two women currently plan to improve the premises that they share for their businesses.  They would like to include tables for the customers who want to eat their food on the premises.

The members operate a variety of businesses: general retail; food sales; and service businesses, for example. \r\n\r\nOur member, Don Francisco, 51, is partnered and has a 4-month old son.  His wife is a homemaker.  \r\n\r\nDon Francisco operates a mototaxi business.  He tells us that mototaxis are an important means of transportation here and widely used by both local people and tourists.  Local people use mototaxis because they're the most common way to get around and tourists use them to see local sights.  Don Francisco says that he especially likes showing tourists around, not only for the fares but also because they're generous tippers.  He has operated the business for 15 years and says that it is an honest living.    \r\n\r\nDon Francisco will use this loan to replace his mototaxi's worn-out engine .  This will be the first loan that he's received from the community bank and he tells us that he hopes to borrow through the bank in the future, as well.\r\n\r\nFor the future, he hopes to provide for his family in the best way that he can.\r\n\r\nThere are two people in the photo that do not belong to the gruop: The man in the white shirt and the woman with the baby.

She is a very determined, kind and hard-working woman.  She has three adult children with whom she lives, alongside her grandchildren.  She lives in her own home which she was able to build as a result of her hard work.\r\n\r\nLidia's business is making clothing.  She makes garments to order but also makes other items that she designs herself.  She has been in this business for more than 15 years but unfortunately, after many years of work, she had to take a few months rest owing to a health problem.  However, she re-started her work a year ago and now she is working even more keenly than before because this is her passion and she feels very happy when she sees her inspiration turn into a beautiful item of clothing.  She feels calm because she knows that her work allows her to make her own income and she does not have to depend on her children's money.  What Lidia likes about her work is that she is able to capture in a garment the design which inspired her.  The ease with which she creates new garments makes her one of the best dressmakers in the city.  She always feels useful.  However, she says that she doesn't really like making men's pants (trousers) because of the time and difficulty that it involves.

Su casa la construyeron en un asentamiento humano y su vida no ha sido f\u00e1cil, pero ella siempre le pone una gota de optimismo a todo lo que hace.\n\nSu trabajo es la venta de golosinas y abarrotes en general, implement\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a bodega en su casa, donde ofrece todo tipo de productos. Atiende todos los d\u00edas, su peque\u00f1a tienda siempre es muy concurrida por ser la \u00fanico de su barrio en ofrece variedad. Ella es muy conocida por su buen humor y carisma y esa actitud ha hecho que sus vecinos le tengan mucho cari\u00f1o y sus ventas aumenten.

She\u2019s been separated from her spouse for many years.  She has six adult children that live with her and her grandchildren.  She built her house in a human settlement and her life hasn\u2019t been easy but she always puts a drop of optimism into everything she does.\r\n\r\nHer work consists in selling snacks and groceries in general.  She set up a small store at home where she offers all types of products.  She\u2019s open every day and her small store is always busy because it\u2019s the only one in her neighborhood that offers variety.  She\u2019s very well-known for her good humor and charisma and that attitude has led to her neighbors holding her in high esteem and her sales increase as a result.\r\n\r\nThe need to be independent and to cover daily household expenses were the main reasons that led her to this work.  She\u2019s been in business for five years.  She works by herself and at the beginning felt that she\u2019d never be able to have a business at home because she used to sell snacks as a street vendor from place to place.  She\u2019d get frustrated because she didn\u2019t sell very much that way.\r\n\r\nThat situation changed and now she feels more tranquil selling in the store she installed at home and was able to get with very much effort.  What she likes best is chatting with her customers and making them laugh.  She feels that the most difficult thing is having to get up very early to start tending to customers.   However, she knows that this will produce good economic results at the end of the day.  She\u2019d love someday to have a snack distributorship to sell all her products at wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis is her first MFP loan so she thanks those who make it possible for her to continue towards her objectives.  She is very committed to make her payments punctually and responsibly.  She\u2019s very happy to belong to her communal bank because all the members are good, kind and mutually supportive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 700 soles to buy larger amounts of snacks and groceries to stock her store and to continue selling smoothly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1124376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy snacks and sweets to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-05T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-04T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":101.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":111.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":111.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":123.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":131.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.06,"local_amount":101.96,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":105.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402013,"comment":null},{"amount":43.83,"local_amount":111.59,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":115.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456288,"comment":null},{"amount":43.64,"local_amount":111.06,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":114.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451953,"comment":null},{"amount":47.51,"local_amount":120.94,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":125.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447126,"comment":null},{"amount":48.43,"local_amount":123.28,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":127.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053030,"comment":null},{"amount":51.53,"local_amount":131.17,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":135.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187959,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She has a four year old child who is the driving force of her life. She lives with other members of her family in her own house that she inherited from her grandmother and despite some needs, she always has a smile to face life.\r\n\r\nHer work has consisted of the sale of sodas and cold beers for over two years. She also provides domestic work in some households that require her help in the kitchen, washing garments or cleaning the house. She is very happy with both jobs because she can be in constant contact with her friends, neighbors and some customers with whom she has formed a good business relationship. It is true that her business provides a good income for her. She feels that although it is still not much to cover her main household expenses and it is because of this that she wishes to establish her own grocery store in the future where she would be able to sell more items and her earnings would multiply. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she thanks those who make it possible for her to continue with her goals. On the other hand, she is very committed to making punctual loan payment with a lot of responsibility. She is also very happy to belong to her communal bank because all of the members are very good, friendly and supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (500 PEN), she will buy a greater quantity of beers and sodas to continue selling and obtain greater earnings.

She has been married to 25-year-old Wilfredo for one year, and together they have a daughter named Ashly who is only five months old. She is Deyssi's main motivation to work hard. Deyssi lives in the house that she built on land given to her by her father. \r\n\r\nOn a professional level Deyssi works for an accounting firm in the administration department, and eventually at another business, in logistics. As a result of the income from her jobs, she was able to save enough to start her business selling beer wholesale. She set up distribution in her home, and works with the help of two people. At the beginning she was very nervous, and she thought that selling beer and working with intoxicated customers would be difficult; that's why she didn't set up a place for direct consumption, but rather started selling wholesale for consumption in restaurants, clubs, bars, or casual events. All of the profit generated by this business without a doubt has been helpful to keep reaching, step by step, for all the things that will benefit her family. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, and she feels secure developing her business. Also she once again promises to make her payments on time, as she has previously. And furthermore, she is very happy to belong to a community bank, as all of its members are very responsible and united together.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (2500 PEN), Deyssi will buy a large quantity of beer so that her business will remain well supplied.

She has lived with Jos\u00e9 for 13 years, and they have 2 young children.  Jos\u00e9 Enrique is 12, and Blanca is 5.  They have rented the house in which they live for 1 year and there is where they share their daily fight to improve.\r\n\r\nElizabeth sells beer, soft drinks, and ice cream of all flavors from a very well-known brand in the city.  She recently established a small business in front of her home, but she has done this work for 8 years.  She has always worked alone because she feels more at peace that way.  She thinks she stays organized this way and doesn't feel stressed out at work.  Sometimes, she makes cakes and sells them in the streets.  She also offers them door to door.  She generally does this work in the mornings, since in the afternoons, for 15 years now, she offers her help at an early education program at a school in her neighborhood to earn extra money.  She is very happy because she knows that all of her work activities produce income that she needs to pay for her home's basic expenses.  Nevertheless, she knows that she has to continue working very hard to maintain this situation.  She hopes to keep working to grow her business more.  In the future, she wants to buy land to build a house.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth credit with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She is thankful for the opportunity and trust that they offer her.
