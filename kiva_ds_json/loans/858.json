","en":"Zaida is 59 years old, and makes a living as a seamstress. She began working in the trade as soon as she completed her primary education at age 17, and her first job was operating machines in a sewing workshop. After a few years, she decided to create her own business and become more independent, since she had to take care of her father. When her children were born, she worked even harder to make her business successful so that she could provide for them. She primarily sews clothing and undergarments for women, though she does make other products. She serves a customer base located mostly in her region, and she is well known for her designing talent. \r\n\r\nShe conducts her sales on credit, and also offers services to clients where they can pay cash up front. The biggest challenge she currently faces to steady business growth is the fact that she lacks the necessary capital to invest in infrastructural improvements. With her challenges and goals in mind, she is requesting this loan, which will be her first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and Kiva. She plans to use the support from this loan to purchase materials in bulk, such as fabric, thread and other input items. She believes that this will be a successful and worthwhile investment, since she already creates high quality products, and her customers are happy with her quality of work. She hopes to make these investments in her business just before its most profitable season: Mother\u2019s Day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1091927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase fabric, thread, and other materials in bulk for her sewing business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-18T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-17T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81806},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84594},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86568},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88588},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90655},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92770},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94935},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97150},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99417},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101737},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104110},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107670}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.19},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.06,"local_amount":81806,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83290.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141271,"comment":null},{"amount":48.66,"local_amount":84594,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":86128.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101175,"comment":null},{"amount":49.8,"local_amount":86568,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":88138.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338788,"comment":null},{"amount":50.96,"local_amount":88588,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":90195.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395340,"comment":null},{"amount":105.51,"local_amount":183425,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":186752.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387129,"comment":null},{"amount":348.01,"local_amount":605019,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":615995.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381706034,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T10:17:00Z","paid_date":"2013-07-21T08:34:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":427422,"name":"Solongo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Solongo, 42, runs a collection point for recycled materials in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

Clotilde lives together with her husband and children. The diverse household expenses are covered by the couple.\r\n\r\nClotilde halted her studies in primary school. To cope with her different expenses, she has been selling staple foods (rice, corn, and more) out of her home for six years.

Today his business contains three cows, two heifers and thirty sheep and yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and milk products.  In order to further develop his business through farming, Taalaibek requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy fertilizers and fuel.

Su experiencia en la ebanister\u00eda data de m\u00e1s de 25 a\u00f1os, por eso hoy tiene una gran diversidad de productos que ofrece en su portafolio; \u00e9l elabora muebles para el hogar, como juegos de sala, de alcobas, puertas, mecedores y art\u00edculos decorativos como l\u00e1mparas, floreros, fruteras, y bases  principalmente. Su meta mas adelante, es comercializar art\u00edculos decorativos al por mayor, pues en la actualidad solo produce por encargos a sus clientes. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es lograr un capital de trabajo suficiente para responder a sus expectativas de crecimiento y esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer cr\u00e9dito que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 madera, pintura pegante y otros insumos para producir en mayor volumen y  ganar descuentos especiales , para as\u00ed mismo vender en importantes cantidades.

is the leader of the \"Kurpuldok\" group and married.  She is involved in animal husbandry, having started this business in 1982 with a sum of 6,000 som (KGS).

She says that she likes keeping her store always stocked up so that her customers can always find what they are looking for. Even though she already has her own grocery store, she keeps on selling meat, and her husband helps her running the shop.\r\nShe will invest her loan in the purchase of cooking oil, canned food,

","en":"Iris, 48 years old, lives with her partner and her two children, aged 17 and 22, in a neighborhood south of the city, where she has a business selling cold drinks and fried food. She also sells merchandise through specialized catalogues. Her business experience dates back 16 years, when she started selling beer, ice, and corn chicha (a fermented drink) with a small amount of capital her partner gave her. Later, with her own earnings, she acquired a fryer and bought more bottles, and also began to sell very cold and pleasant drinks, adjusted to Colombia's hot Caribbean climate. Gradually she has made very good use of her captive customer base in order to diversify what she offers and thus be able to offer her customers credit for the items they need, especially cosmetics. Currently she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she has had with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Manzuura was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of 30,000 som (KGS).  Today, her product selection is still limited, and this is why Manzuura requested a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.

Also, a small part of the credit will be used for purchasing fertilizers. Michael will grow cucumbers and tomatoes during the summer and fall months and greens during winter and spring. He will sell harvested products at the Kutaisi market. The income of the family will significantly increase and Michael will be able to create better living conditions for his wife and mother.

In addition to this, he will be able to realize his dream, which is to continue supporting his children so they will finish their professional studies. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1089878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer and plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-05-18T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-17T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":12195.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810605,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-20T10:34:55Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":423570,"name":"Deisy De La Paz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Deisy, vive con su esposo y cuatro hijos de 14, 12, 7 y 2 a\u00f1os de edad, tres de ellos est\u00e1n estudiando, Deisy se dedica a la venta de antojitos (empanadas, pasteles, tamales), lleva tres a\u00f1os en el negocio, lo aprendi\u00f3 con su madre, hoy en d\u00eda lo realiza por el af\u00e1n de aportar en la casa y ayudar con los gastos.\nElla solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ma\u00edz, pl\u00e1tanos, papas, aceite, condimentos, que son su materia prima para la elaboraci\u00f3n de los alimentos, con este pr\u00e9stamo tendr\u00e1 los recursos para poder comprarse todo lo necesario y poder aumentar su producci\u00f3n para la venta.\nLa aspiraci\u00f3n de Deisy es dentro de alg\u00fan tiempo instalar una tienda, en la que pueda ofrecer varios productos no perecederos y adem\u00e1s los antojitos, desde su propia casa.\n","en":"Deisy lives with her husband and four children who are 14, 12, 7 and 2 years old; tres currently are studying.

","en":"Joaqu\u00edn is 44 years old and lives with Sandra, whom he has been with for a little while. They want to have children, but they want to acquire some comforts for their home first before welcoming new members of the family. They live in a house they built in the native community of Chanchamayo, Peru. Joaqu\u00edn has lived in the area for 23 years, and since then has made a living growing citrus fruit, coffee and annatto distinctly distributed over eight plots of land. \"It suits me to plant more coffee and annatto. It's harvested once a year, but it sells immediately,\" he says. Currently he is harvesting oranges and mandarins, which he sells within his community since the buyers already know the quality of his fruit and visit him to acquire the products. With the support of hired day laborers he can cover the eight areas of crops he has. The work is far from easy, so Sandra does her part by bringing food and cold drinks, and when the meals are finished she picks up field-working tools to help out. Joaqu\u00edn's plans for the near future are to increase his coffee and annatto production by buying new seedlings to put in the empty spaces and also changing out the coffee plants that aren't producing for new ones. This is his eighth loan with Kiva partner MFP. He belongs to the \"Las Rositas de Ubiriki\" community bank, where he feels satisfied with the work carried out over all these loan cycles as a responsible member. With the money he is requesting, he plans to hire day laborers to clean his crops and use the rest to purchase sacks of fertilizer for his citrus and coffee plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1092229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire day laborers and purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-19T01:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-18T01:00:11Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joaqu\u00edn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2050.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121676,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-18T00:53:14Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":427559,"name":"Restituta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Restituta is a married woman from Trinidad, Bohol.

She lives on her own while her husband is away, and works as a food vendor selling quesillos, a typical and flavorful Mexican dish that is very popular with the tourists that visit the city.  She is a mother of two.  \n\nShe started making quesillos when she was very young helping by her mother.  She decided to start her own business and originally sold enchiladas to help with the expenses around the house during the time she was pregnant with her first child.  Later she discovered that she earned more money by selling quesillos and decided to work with a friend who could help her find better and cheaper ingredients.\n\nHer children help her with the business, selling their products in Granada and the surrounding neighborhoods.  Her husband also helps with the household expenses by sending money home.  \n\nShe will use her loan to buy cheese, onions, vinegar, tortillas and sour cream, which are all ingredients that make up the quesillo.  Rosa hopes that the loan will help her since the busy season is approaching and she will be able to offer more products to her clients.  \n\nAfter she pays off this loan she wants to use the profits combined with a new loan to make repairs on her home.

Despite her age, Victoria has worked in the fields with the same vigor for the past 20 years, dedicating herself to agriculture. She is a native of the city of Huancayo and came to the central jungle to start a family, and since that time she learned how to grow citrus fruits, yucca and pineapple.

Hoeun owns around 3 hectares of farmland, which provides a suitable output for the family. On the other hand, he doesn\u2019t possess any animals for the maintenance of the rice field. As in the previous time, he usually borrows other villager\u2019s animals or a tractor to work on his farm, and this has the effect of making much expense.

This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend money on cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1500 PHP in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\nMary Grace dreams of seeing her children succeed in their chosen careers.

His son works as a policeman and his daughter is a nurse in a local hospital. Alex runs the dairy farm owned by the family. He takes care of two milk cows and produces on average 40 kg of cheese per month, which is sold from the family home to local dairy product retailers. The total average monthly income of the family is 1000 laris. \r\n\r\nAlex has requested a loan for purchasing calves.

His greatest challenge is lacking sufficient working capital to make the investment immediately and this is why he\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo by means of which he will buy mobile phone recharges and repair his washing machines so that they will not wear away and with this he\u2019ll strengthen his business making it more successful each time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1092797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","use":"to buy mobile phone recharges and to repair his washing machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-19T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-18T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":73200},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":73663},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75382},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":77141},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78941},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80783},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":82668},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":84597},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":86571},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":87054}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.46,"local_amount":73200,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":76711.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101184,"comment":null},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":73663,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":77196.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338796,"comment":null},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":75382,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":78997.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395349,"comment":null},{"amount":45.8,"local_amount":77141,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":80841.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775149,"comment":null},{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":78941,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":82727.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387136,"comment":null},{"amount":47.97,"local_amount":80783,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84658.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993985,"comment":null},{"amount":49.08,"local_amount":82668,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":86633.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130352,"comment":null},{"amount":153.32,"local_amount":258222,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":270608.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519230,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-31T12:54:40Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
