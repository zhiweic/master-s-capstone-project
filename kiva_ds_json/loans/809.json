He would like to develop his business in order to gain more profit, but because of deficiencies in working capital, Vincent is requesting a loan of P25,000, which will be used in buying equipment such as a welding machine, barrena and other necessities. Hopefully, with this new equipment he will be able to provide high quality of service to his customers and at the same time he will be able to ensure a good stability of living for his

En este taller le ha ido muy bien y sus planes de crecimiento son muchos, pero su capital de trabajo es insuficiente para hacerlo, tan pronto como \u00e9l quiere. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 materias pri,as e insumos para fabricar nuevos dise\u00f1os, como madera pinturas, lacas pegantes, puntillas taches, y tambi\u00e9n invertir\u00e1 un poco en hacer adecuaciones a su taller, poniendo plantilla al piso y una cubierta que le permita trabajar en mejores condiciones especialmente en la \u00e9poca de lluvias.

","en":"Edwin, 44, lives in the city of Cartagena with his wife and their 2 year-old child.  There, in this beautiful and historic city, he works as a carpenter.  He started this business 15 years ago when he was working in a cabinetmaking shop.  Since he really enjoyed this trade, he had the idea of studying architecture, and so he began to improve his work.  Over time, he became quite well-known, and so he decided to start working independently in his own home.  He started up his own business in a workshop, gradually buying the tools and equipment he needed.  His workshop has done very well, and he has a lot of expansion plans, but he lacks sufficient working capital to implement these plans as quickly as he would like.  This is the reason that he came to seek a Kiva loan.  This will be his first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and with it he will buy supplies and raw materials so that he can make some new designs, such as wood, paint, lacquer, glue, tacks and screws, and he will also invest some of the money in making some improvements to his workshop.  He will put in new wood flooring and will also add a roof that will allow him to work in better conditions, especially during the rainy season.  His goal for the future is to make his important purchases in bulk so he can obtain a good discount.  To do this, he will prepare to participate in each loan cycle offered by this institution."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1020248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy wood, paint, lacquer, glue, tacks and screws, and also to make some small improvements to his workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-12T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-11T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Edwin  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":86013},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":92686},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":94849},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":97062},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":99327},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":101645},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":104016},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":106443},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":108927},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":111469},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":114070},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":116731},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":119455},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":122242},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125094},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":128013},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":131000},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":140958}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.69},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.46,"local_amount":86013,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":87539.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141049,"comment":null},{"amount":53.29,"local_amount":92686,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":94331.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395122,"comment":null},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":94849,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":96532.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993799,"comment":null},{"amount":397.08,"local_amount":690581,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":702838.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130168,"comment":null},{"amount":595.63,"local_amount":1035871,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1054257.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967482,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T21:22:34Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:38:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":401295,"name":"Edwin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edwin is 27 years old, he runs a butcher shop to earn a living.

is Rhodora, 34, a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Rolando who is a driver. She has one child. With her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                     \r\n        \r\nRhodora operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php 11,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands. \r\n\r\nRhodora hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through her hard work.

Behind him in the photo are agriculture borrowers.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Teachers of this noble institution have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan of SLL 3,800,000 for the entire group. With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will be able to improve their standard of living. Thirty-five-year-old Sansie is the leader of this group of teachers. Sansie was born in a place called Nongowa. He is married and has two children, one in secondary school and the other is in college. Sansie is a teacher and has been in the teaching profession for nine years now. He has requested this loan in order to pay school\/college fees for his children. School staff from this institution, like many other school's staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, comes to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1025343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay school\/college fees for his children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Koidu\/Kono","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2012-03-12T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-11T06:50:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sansie\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ahdraman S.

This is her second loan from the institution and she plans to use it as working capital (to buy a large grill and to have investment capital) for her business.  Her reason for requesting the loan is to expand her business since she wants to sell grilled food on weekends.  Norah has challenges in her business such as competition, and she plans to use the profits from the loan to increase her work capital.  Norah's goal is to buy land to build her own house.

She says she wants to acquire a better breed of cow to improve her milk production so as to make her family more secure financially and improve the family's living standards.\r\n\r\nSarah says lack of capital remains the main challenge to smallholder farmers' business attempts. She is glad that Juhudi Kilimo loans are focused on making the local farming business better.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1029075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

From this marriage, she has three children, who are 12, 6, and 2 years old. The two oldest children are studying in high school and elementary school. Her husband is a driver.\r\n\r\nShe is a homemaker who, in order to have her own resources and with those help her husband with the household expenses, sells catalog clothing and Avon and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories for women). She sells door-to-door. She works three days a week for two to three hours a day, especially in the mornings when her children are in school. She only has to carry her youngest, as she does not have anyone with whom she can leave him. But this does not keep her from making her rounds, dropping off her products, and collecting every week. She has been doing this trade for a year, and it is going well.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics, and catalog clothing, as she has several orders to deliver.  She is the founder of the communal bank and would like the loan because loans are very important to her business. \r\n \r\nHer dream is to have a boutique.\r\n\r\nShe is shown in the photo with her son.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1021480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics y clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-03-12T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-11T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rossana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1540,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":128.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":258.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270034131,"comment":null},{"amount":258.32,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":258.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646212,"comment":null},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":258.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321292,"comment":null},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":258.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208892,"comment":null},{"amount":258.32,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":258.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335217,"comment":null},{"amount":258.37,"local_amount":256.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":258.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391064,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-17T02:00:19Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":401680,"name":"Javzanpagma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Javzanpagma, a 34-year-old hardworking woman, lives with her family in a ger (a traditional Mongolian felt tent) in a ger district which lacks basic infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

The city is known for its traditional culture, its joyful people, and the San Pedro and San Pablo fiestas.\r\n\r\nThis is where we meet Gladis, age 46.  She is married and has four children.  Two of them are adults, and the two 17 year olds are twins.  They go to school and still live with her.  Her husband is a driver.\r\n\r\nShe sells clothes and Avon and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfume, and women\u2019s accessories).  She works every day, mostly in the mornings.  This is because that is when it is easier for her to go along her route.  She sells door-to-door and by order.

She also cares for her nephew, whose parents are not able to support him. \r\n\r\nShe initially started a business selling oil, milk, and soap. She had this business for seven years. Since she started receiving loans, she has been able to expand to a more profitable product. She now sells drinks in glass bottles. This is how most soft drinks and beer are sold in the Republic of Congo. Customers return the glass bottles to her and receive a discount on their next purchase of drinks. She will use the loan to buy more glass bottles and drinks for her business. \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is the initial cost of the expensive glass bottles and the transportation costs associated with carrying very heavy glass bottles. She hopes to one day grow her business large enough to purchase a vehicle to aid in transporting bottles. Her business strategy is to stock a large variety of drinks.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

is 45 years old. He lives in the village of Pereta, West Georgia. David lives with his family: wife \u2013 Iza and three children (20, 18 and 14 years old). His younger children go to school and the elder one helps his father in construction works. \r\n\r\nDavid is a construction worker. He mainly works on roofing houses. His elder son helps him. Along with his main job, David is busy with a family agriculture business. In particular the family owns a greenhouse, where greens and vegetables are grown. He sells harvested vegetables locally to greengrocery products retailers. Also, the family has a plot of land where nut and peach trees grow. David sells harvested nuts and peaches on the local market as well. The total average monthly income of the family is 700 Laris. \r\n\r\nDavid has requested credit for fixing the greenhouse.

With the profits, he plans to expand the area he farms to get more output, pay school fees and put away some savings.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Behind him in the picture, fellow agriculture borrowers were looking on.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Behind him, in the picture, there are a few agricultural workers pictured.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural sector accounts for 37 percent of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65 percent of Rwanda's export revenue and employs approximately 90 percent of Rwandans (as of 2009). \r\n\r\nDespite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
