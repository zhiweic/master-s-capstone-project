The communal bank Divino Nino el Sauce is thankful for the help the Kiva lenders provide to people of few resources and poor countries like Nicaragua, so they are able to have a dignified job.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":873.44,"image":{"id":1439689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to invest in work capital and supply her business purchasing and selling food products for her restaurant, such as chicken, tomatoes, red meat, lettuce, cream, tortillas, plantains, potatoes, and ripe plantains.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liduvina Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Emelida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen De Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena Yamilet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erminia Ancelma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":43500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3107.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3107.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":248.66,"local_amount":6270.56,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6342.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419896601,"comment":null},{"amount":248.45,"local_amount":6265.37,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6336.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545903,"comment":null},{"amount":376.33,"local_amount":9489.97,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":9598.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199649,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-26T19:47:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610672,"name":"Dative","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dative is 43 years old.

has been a teacher since 1990. She teaches at a local school and also provides additional lessons at home. Anna lives with her grown-up children, and her husband works abroad and tries to support his family financially. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the income that Anna gets from her business is very important for the whole family. Unfortunately, there are no facilities in her house for providing classes to her students, so Anna has applied to SEF for the help.

She is also cultivating grapes. Farming is a very important source of income for the family. To continue developing it, Peruz needs some financial assistance. She particularly needs a loan of $3,000 to purchase two calves, to buy forage for the livestock, and to pay for the harvesting services. As this is Peruz\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF.

Peruz and her family greatly rely on the good will of the lenders and will be very thankful to them for assisting them to develop their agribusiness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1436507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase two calves, to buy forage for the livestock and to pay for the harvesting services","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Nor Armavir village, Armavir region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T20:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T20:40:01Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":104.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":114.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":116.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":113.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":120.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":120.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":119.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":120.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":121.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":122.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":123.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":124.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":127.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":127.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":127.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":130.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":131.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":131.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":134.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":135.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":136.71},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":137.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.98},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.27},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610747,"name":"Moses","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses is a farmer who is 42 years old.

Es un lugar muy bonito, se caracteriza por tener mucha vegetaci\u00f3n y una gran cantidad de \u00e1rboles. En la comunidad a\u00fan se habla la lengua mazahua. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron por dos razones \"Ilusi\u00f3n\" porque quieren progresar y sobresalir pero tambi\u00e9n por el nombre de un lugar muy especial para todos ellos \"Los Lobos\". La se\u00f1ora Avelina es la representante del grupo, ella es muy sonriente, siempre est\u00e1 de muy buen humor y su alegr\u00eda se contagia a la hora de platicar con ella. Tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Francisco desde hace ya 27 a\u00f1os y juntos formaron una familia con seis hijos de los cuales ya solo dos dependen de dicha pareja y a\u00fan asisten a la escuela. Do\u00f1a Ave, como le llaman, se dedica a la cr\u00eda, engorda y venta de cerdos desde hace ya 10 a\u00f1os; los compra con un proveedor de Michoac\u00e1n quien se los deja m\u00e1s baratos. Do\u00f1a Ave comenta \u201cInicie mi actividad de los cerdos porque una se\u00f1ora me vendi\u00f3 una cerdita solo ten\u00eda curiosidad, pero esa cerdita ya ven\u00eda cargada: tuvo nueve cerditos\". Ave cri\u00f3 y vendi\u00f3 los animalitos y obtuvo buenas ganancias, fue as\u00ed que decidi\u00f3 dedicarse de lleno a la actividad. Estos animales son comprados desde muy chicos con apenas cuarenta d\u00edas de nacidos durante cuatro o cinco meses los alimenta con ma\u00edz y cuando alcanzan un peso m\u00e1s de 100 kilos los ofrecen para venderlos. En esta ocasi\u00f3n, Ave est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para comprar material como cemento, varilla, cal, block para la construcci\u00f3n de sus saudas aunque por el momento no tiene ning\u00fan cerdo est\u00e1 pensando que los comprar\u00e1 en el mes de diciembre, pero quiere tener un lugar ya bien establecido. En el mes de agosto termin\u00f3 de vender sus 10 cerdos. Do\u00f1a Ave est\u00e1 muy contenta porque gracias a su esfuerzo han podido levantar sus casas de material m\u00e1s reforzado. \u201cAnteriormente mis hijos, esposo y yo viv\u00edamos solo en unas casas de madera pero desde que iniciamos con la cr\u00eda de estos animales hemos podido levantar nuestra casa de colado\u201d. Al parecer no presenta ning\u00fan reto importante en su actividad. Do\u00f1a Ade comenta \u201cMi sue\u00f1o es poder terminar nuestra casa en un segundo nivel para vivir c\u00f3modamente con toda mi familia incluso mis nietos, pero tambi\u00e9n me gustar\u00eda que mis ni\u00f1os terminaran de estudiar y si se puede, que estudien una carrera profesional.\u201d Las integrantes del grupo son Do\u00f1a Margarita y Rosa quienes invertir\u00e1n en la cr\u00eda, engorda y venta de sus borregos.","en":"The \"Ilusi\u00f3n los Lobos\" group is in a remote community away from the town. To get there, the group needs special transportation. It's a beautiful place, known for having a variety of vegetation and many trees. They speak the Mazahua language in the community. They chose the group's name because of the two meanings of \"Ilusi\u00f3n\" and because they want to progress and stand out, but also for a place that is special to all of them, \"Los Lobos.\"\r\n\r\nAvelina is a member of the group. She loves to smile and is always in a good mood. Her happiness is contagious when talking to her. She is 42, and has been married to Francisco for 27 years. They have six children, two of whom are dependents and in school. Ave, as she's known, works by growing, fattening, and selling pigs. She has done this for ten years. She buys the pigs from a vendor in Michoac\u00e1n, who sells them at a low price. Ave says, \"I started my work with pigs because a woman sold me a small pig because I was interested. However, that pig was heavy and had nine piglets.\" Ave raised and sold them and earned some income. This is when she decided to make a living from this work. She buys the animals at a young age, barely 40 days old. For four to five months, she feeds them corn and when they reach 100 kilos, she puts them up for sale.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Ave is requesting a loan to buy supplies such as cement, spokes, lime powder, and blocks to build a larger space for her pigs. Right now, she doesn't have any pigs, but she's thinking she will buy them in December. First, though, she needs an established space. In August, she finished selling off ten pigs. Ave is very happy because thanks to her efforts, she has been able to improve her house with better materials. \"Before having children, my husband and I lived in a house made of wood, but since we started raising animals, we've been able to build this plaster house.\" There doesn't seem to be any particular challenge in her work. Ave says, \"My dream is to finish our house with a second level so we can live comfortably with everyone, including our grandchildren. But I'd also like my children to finish school if they can, that they study a professional career path.\" The other group members are Margarita and Rose, who will invest in raising, fattening, and selling their sheep."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":682.1,"image":{"id":1441446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy supplies such as blocks, cement, lime powder, wire, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Los Lobos Centro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4273.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4574.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4783.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5036.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5330.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":368.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":329.44,"local_amount":4273.88,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4312.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644471,"comment":null},{"amount":352.66,"local_amount":4574.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4616.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877932,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-01T20:33:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610511,"name":"Mo Shakti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seema is about 32 years old and lives with her husband and four children at JK Pur in Rayagada district of Odisha state in India.

Each one has her own business: Raquel sells clothing, Maricela sells backpacks and shoes and finally Emma sells clothing. \r\n\r\nEmma says she is 40 years old and is married to Narciso. Together they make a family with 8 children although only one of them is still dependent on them, studying in Secondary School. \r\n\r\nEmma is requesting this loan from VisionFund and Kiva to buy more clothes, cloth, thread, yarn etc. She has done this business for 19 years. She comments,\" I started selling clothing myself as there where so many children. I had to do something to help with the household expenses and the education of my children\".  She started selling accessories in the small plazas and villages. She remembers that although she didn't have a fixed place to sell the revenues were good. However little by little she was able to save enough to rent a more stable commercial spot so she didn't have to trudge through the streets. This was when she decided to sell clothing of all sorts.\r\n\r\nShe has had this place for 3 years. It is located in another municipality. Emma's difficulty is that the rent is very expensive and she has not been able to find another at a better price. She pays 4000 MXN monthly. At first she paid half that, but the rent has increased little by little climbing to that amount. This does not discourage her, just the opposite. She is very hard-working and needs this income to continue paying this rent. It is much better to have the stable location than to carry her merchandise home with her at night, which for Emma would be a lot more work. \"I would not want to lose this place as it is difficult to get a place. My only goal is to continue to support my child with his studies. I would love to see him become a professional as he would be able to enjoy a better quality of living\". \r\n\r\nThe three members of the group are grateful with the institutions for the loan as they can invest in their businesses and be able to offer a higher quality of living to their families."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1845.71,"image":{"id":1441438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more clothes, cloth, thread, yarn etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Cruz Mextepec, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-29T00:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-29T00:10:01Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7656.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":8005.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":8459.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":8877.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":585.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":647.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":679.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":585.86,"local_amount":7656.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7669.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991825,"comment":null},{"amount":612.57,"local_amount":8005.88,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8019.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644473,"comment":null},{"amount":647.28,"local_amount":8459.48,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8473.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877934,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-29T08:14:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610640,"name":"Ann Maa Bilasuni Self Help Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Basanti is a 44-year-old lady.

Many years ago, Francisco visited Costa Rica and worked as a volunteer forest ranger. Full of dreams when he returned, Francisco sought technical training with the Colombian National Service. He also began a business producing and selling honey. The 2 colonies he began with have since multiplied into the 24 colonies he now has in production. He needs to change the colonies into new changes which means that he will need to acquire materials and a complete beekeeper's uniform.\r\n\r\nFrancisco receives help from his son in the execution of this business. His son has learned all of the techniques and adds value to the business. Francisco's goals are to: register his products with the National Institute of Medicines and Nourishment (\"INVIMA\"); add to his production equipment; and open a storefront. Drought is the greatest challenge that his business faces, because fewer flowers bloom.

With this new loan she'll buy ceramic tiles, cement, and steel tubes to change the abutments of the outdoor covered patio, which has deteriorated, and which she fears the rains will damage even more.

Her business started through family tradition, since she learned it from her mother. Taking advantage of the fact that she lives near the Troncal del Occidente highway, where travelers and visitors to a well-known park come by, she started her own business and it went well.

Monika\u2019s brother supports her very much in running the small business. \r\n\r\nTo be able to run the business in a more sustainable way and to become compatible, Monika needs a loan of $3,000.  This will allow her to do lining of the store and to enlarge her assortment of goods.  She has previously received a loan from a local financial institution but was not able to repay it.  However, thanks to the hard work, Monika was able to run her small business in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments.  Thus, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.  The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Monika and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain and develop their small business.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1436551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to do lining and to purchase household goods for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-09-29T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-29T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":77.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":109.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":112.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":110.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":116.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":118.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":116.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":118.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":122.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":124.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":129.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":130.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":133.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":135.71},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":138.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":139.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":141.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":143.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":145.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.09},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.27},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.71},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610983,"name":"Mao's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mao is a 47-year-old married woman who lives with her husband and 4 children.

Bhasi's family income is only 3,000 Indian rupees (INR). That is very low, and that is why she started her own business two years ago. She cultivates vegetables in her village and sells them at a nearby market. Bhasi's husband helps her; he is also a farmer having good experience in cultivation.\r\n\r\nBhasi formed a group that is \"Maa Sidheswari Self Help Group\" with nine other women from her village.

Adem\u00e1s, en la comunidad existen \u00e1rboles muy frondosos, los habitantes de la comunidad son muy arraigados a sus costumbres y tradiciones, una caracter\u00edstica m\u00e1s de laspersonas de esta comunidad es que a\u00fan conservan su lengua mazahua y la siguen hablando adem\u00e1s del espa\u00f1ol. La mayor\u00eda de las integrantes del grupo se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de bordados conservando la tradici\u00f3n de la comunidad, por eso mismo decidieron ponerle ese nombre a su grupo. Do\u00f1a Alejandra es una integrante del grupo platica que tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada desde hace 29 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Marcos y juntos formaron una familia con cuatro hijos que ahora ya son independientes.

They are all very good neighbors who know each other very well and live in a Mazuhua community, which is recognized for the majority of its people who work making embroidery. In addition, there are very leafy trees in the community. \r\n\r\nThe community members have deeply rooted customs and traditions. One main characteristic of the people in this community is that they still speak their Mazahua language, in addition to speaking Spanish. They majority of the group members work making embroidery, preserving the community\u2019s tradition \u2013 thus, the name of the group. \r\n\r\nAlejandra is a member of this group. She says that she is 52 years old. She married Marcos when she was 29 years old, and together they have a family of four children who are now independent. Alejandra has worked doing embroidery since she was forty. She says that she learned this work because, since she was very young, her mother also worked making these handicrafts. \r\n\r\nAlejandra concluded that, \u201cKnowing how to embroider is a tradition; here, anyone who doesn\u2019t make these kinds of embroidery - it\u2019s as if they didn\u2019t live in the community, because it\u2019s part of our customs.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlejandra has a small shop in her house where she sells her handicrafts. She has no problem making sales. This time, she is requesting the loan to purchase more material, like needles, yarn, wool cloth, etc. \r\n\r\n\u201cFor me, the loan will be a great help, because in this way I will be able to obtain my material more easily.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlejandra\u2019s main obstacle is the lack of a market in which to offer her goods; in her community and the surrounding areas, it\u2019s very difficult to get good earnings. \r\n\r\n\u201cI would like it if they would help us to look for a good market or some method of offering our embroidery.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe has been taking out loans from VisionFund and Kiva for several months, which has been a great help for her business because of the ease with which she can obtain her raw material. Alejandra\u2019s and the group\u2019s goal is to improve the quality of life for their families. They make a great effort to obtain better earnings to pay for their home expenses, like their children\u2019s education and buying more clothing, shoes and food for them. \r\n\r\nLikewise, Ang\u00e9lica and the other group members are very grateful for the loan, because they will be able to invest in their businesses. \u00c1ngeles will invest in her cosmetics sales, and Angelina, Zenaida, Lucia, and Luisa will invest in their embroidery. They are very grateful to Kiva and VisionFund for all of their loans; for them, it has been a big help.

The members of the group that are requesting loans are Celinda, who will invest in toys and novelties, Joaqu\u00edn who will invest in the breeding and sale of sheep, Carmen and Regina who will invest in the rearing and sale of chickens, and Agustina and Ana Karen  who will invest in their grocery stores.\r\n\r\nAlicia, or Ali, who is the representative of the group, is 57 years old, married to Gustavo, and together they form a family with three children. Ali has been breeding, fattening and selling pigs for several years. She explains that when she was little, she would watch her neighbors doing this activity, and she decided that she wanted to do the same in the future. With already 4 years of stable business, Ali says that it is not a difficult task raising her animals because they don't require much work. \r\n\r\nShe likes to have animals because in some way they are a source of income. Ali buys them when they are little, and then raises and fattens them over a period of approximately four to five months. During this time, Ali must feed the pigs very well with corn, and another type of food three or four times a day. When they are already a considerable weight is when she starts to offer the pigs. She offers her animals to her neighbors occasionally when she gets lucky, and to people that come to her home to buy them without needing to search for a buyer.\r\n\r\nOf the four years she has been conducting business, she has not had any considerable problem, but when her pigs become sick and die, these are losses of investments and earnings. For Ali, it's very normal that her little pigs always get sick. She goes to the vet to see if there is a cure, and this is how she saves her pigs. Nevertheless, despite this difficulty, she doesn't think to stop raising pigs because, even though she doesn't have children in school anymore, her dream is to be able to improve her home with her earnings.

The land that she and her husband work is their own. It is located on a plot that is behind the house where they live, so maintenance and cleaning are easier to perform, since they keep an eye on it and care for it.\r\n\r\nHer plans in the future are to be able to continue buying more land and to continue growing coffee on it, planting a better and larger variety, such as Caturra and Catuai, which are more attractive in the market. In this way, she will be able to generate more income for her family and household, and she will be able to continue supporting her daughters in their studies so that they can prepare themselves academically. These reasons are why today she has requested a loan that she will use to perform maintenance by purchasing agricultural supplies such as manure, plant fertilizer, and coffee fertilizer, among others."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1441574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies to care for her coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-29T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-29T17:20:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-03T16:16:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":613878,"name":"Los Tellez Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo lo conforman tres comerciantes emprendedores uno de ellos es Mar\u00eda tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en uni\u00f3n libre, tiene un hijo, su negocio es la venta de especie y cajetas ambulantes  desde hace 7 a\u00f1os.

Nancy has a degree in international commerce but, through choice and in order to continue family tradition, she works producing handicrafts to sell.  She sells country art items, jewellery, decorative frames, Christmas decorations, and other items.  She takes orders from customers for products, and, in addition, she sells catalogue items such as clothes and footwear.

Nancy is applying for this loan in order to increase her working capital.  She will invest the money in buying materials and merchandise (threads, material, paint, wooden figurines, stones for accessories, clothes, and footwear) in order to to take advantage of the offers and discounts that she can enjoy.  With this she will have all the necessary supplies in order to fulfill her orders quickly.  The Christmas season is approaching and her sales will \r\nnoticeably increase and generate a higher income.  Nancy's biggest challenge is to organise her business as, due to the variety of products she offers, it is difficult to have a working plan.  However, she has been able to use her knowledge and has managed to meet her customers' needs.  Nancy dreams of strengthening her business and managing it more professionally.  She even wants to have the opportunity to export her products, though she realises that she must be determined, disciplined and dedicated in order to achieve this.

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php,25,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan on her current revolving fund to buy recyclable materials from collectors.\r\n \r\nRosita dreams of having a better living and hopes that her business will flourish.

He was born and raised in the country and worked many years on a farm, responsible for a wide range of agricultural tasks. \r\n\r\nConcerns about safety prompted Camilo to move to the city with his family. He then began to work in a cafeteria, and soon took the initiative to start his own business. Camilo runs a cafe in a very busy neighborhood, on a street leading to a beach. He works seven days a week from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and has one employee. \r\n\r\nCamilo's drive, determination, and dedication have helped him achieve his goals. He's survived tough times and still faces various obstacles, such as truck driver strikes, that directly affect his sales. But Camilo doesn't let such challenges hold him back, and keeps looking for opportunities to improve his business. He is therefore applying for a loan so he can invest in chairs, tables, and wholesale inventory  (snacks, sodas, coffee, fried foods, and other goods). \r\n\r\nThese investments will allow Camilo to offer his customers a greater variety of goods to satisfy their tastes, increasing his sales and thus his income. Camilo hopes this will allow him to progress toward fulfilling his ambitions, especially paying off his business, for which he still owes money. Camilo hopes to provide his family a better quality of life and give his children the chance to study at a university.
